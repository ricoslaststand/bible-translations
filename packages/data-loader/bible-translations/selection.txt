Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take [Joram] up and cast him in the plot of Naboth the Jezreelite's field; for remember how, when I and you rode together 
THERE WAS a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who [reverently] feared God and abstained from and shunned evil [because it was wrong]. -- job 1:1
.
And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters. -- job 1:2
.
He possessed 7,sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very great body of servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East. -- job 1:3
.
His sons used to go and feast in the house of each on his day (birthday) in turn, and they invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them. -- job 1:4
.
And when the days of their feasting were over, Job sent for them to purify and hallow them, and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed or disowned God in their hearts. Thus did Job at all [such] times. -- job 1:5
.
Now there was a day when the sons (the angels) of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan (the adversary and accuser) also came among them. -- job 1:6
.
And the Lord said to Satan, From where did you come? Then Satan answered the Lord, From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it. -- job 1:7
.
And the Lord said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who [reverently] fears God and abstains from and shuns evil [because it is wrong]? -- job 1:8
.
Then Satan answered the Lord, Does Job [reverently] fear God for nothing? -- job 1:9
.
Have You not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have conferred prosperity and happiness upon him in the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. -- job 1:10
.
But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has, and he will curse You to Your face. -- job 1:11
.
And the Lord said to Satan (the adversary and the accuser), Behold, all that he has is in your power, only upon the man himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. -- job 1:12
.
And there was a day when [Job's] sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house [on his birthday], -- job 1:13
.
And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, -- job 1:14
.
And the Sabeans swooped down upon them and took away [the animals]. Indeed, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. -- job 1:15
.
While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, The fire of God (lightning) has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you. -- job 1:16
.
While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, The Chaldeans divided into three bands and made a raid upon the camels and have taken them away, yes, and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. -- job 1:17
.
While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, -- job 1:18
.
And behold, there came a great [whirlwind] from the desert, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you. -- job 1:19
.
Then Job arose and rent his robe and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped -- job 1:20
.
And said, Naked (without possessions) came I [into this world] from my mother's womb, and naked (without possessions) shall I depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed (praised and magnified in worship) be the name of the Lord! -- job 1:21
.
In all this Job sinned not nor charged God foolishly. -- job 1:22
.
AGAIN THERE was a day when the sons of God [the angels] came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan (the adversary and the accuser) came also among them to present himself before the Lord. -- job 2:1
.
And the Lord said to Satan, From where do you come? And Satan (the adversary and the accuser) answered the Lord, From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it. -- job 2:2
.
And the Lord said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who [reverently] fears God and abstains from and shuns all evil [because it is wrong]? And still he holds fast his integrity, although you moved Me against him to destroy him without cause. -- job 2:3
.
Then Satan answered the Lord, Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has will he give for his life. -- job 2:4
.
But put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse and renounce You to Your face. -- job 2:5
.
And the Lord said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life. -- job 2:6
.
So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and smote Job with loathsome and painful sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. -- job 2:7
.
And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself, and he sat [down] among the ashes. -- job 2:8
.
Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your blameless uprightness? Renounce God and die! -- job 2:9
.
But he said to her, You speak as one of the impious and foolish women would speak. What? Shall we accept [only] good at the hand of God and shall we not accept [also] misfortune and what is of a bad nature? In [spite of] all this, Job did not sin with his lips. -- job 2:10
.
Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, for they had made an appointment together to come to condole with him and to comfort him. -- job 2:11
.
And when they looked from afar off and saw him [disfigured] beyond recognition, they lifted up their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe, and they cast dust over their heads toward the heavens. -- job 2:12
.
So they sat down with [Job] on the ground for seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief and pain were very great. -- job 2:13
.
AFTER THIS, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day (birthday). -- job 3:1
.
And Job said, -- job 3:2
.
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which announced, There is a man-child conceived. -- job 3:3
.
Let that day be darkness! May not God above regard it, nor light shine upon it. -- job 3:4
.
Let gloom and deep darkness claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that blackens the day terrify it (the day that I was born). -- job 3:5
.
As for that night, let thick darkness seize it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. -- job 3:6
.
Yes, let that night be solitary and barren; let no joyful voice come into it. -- job 3:7
.
Let those curse it who curse the day, who are skilled in rousing up Leviathan. -- job 3:8
.
Let the stars of the early dawn of that day be dark; let [the morning] look in vain for the light, nor let it behold the day's dawning, -- job 3:9
.
Because it shut not the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow and trouble from my eyes. -- job 3:10
.
Why was I not stillborn? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bore me? -- job 3:11
.
Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck? -- job 3:12
.
For then would I have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then would I have been at rest [in death] -- job 3:13
.
With kings and counselors of the earth, who built up [now] desolate ruins for themselves, -- job 3:14
.
Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. -- job 3:15
.
Or [why] was I not a miscarriage, hidden and put away, as infants who never saw light? -- job 3:16
.
There [in death] the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest. -- job 3:17
.
There the [captive] prisoners rest together; they hear not the taskmaster's voice. -- job 3:18
.
The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master. -- job 3:19
.
Why is light [of life] given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul, -- job 3:20
.
Who long and wait for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, -- job 3:21
.
Who rejoice exceedingly and are elated when they find the grave? -- job 3:22
.
[Why is the light of day given] to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in? -- job 3:23
.
For my sighing comes before my food, and my groanings are poured out like water. -- job 3:24
.
For the thing which I greatly fear comes upon me, and that of which I am afraid befalls me. -- job 3:25
.
I was not or am not at ease, nor had I or have I rest, nor was I or am I quiet, yet trouble came and still comes [upon me]. -- job 3:26
.
THEN ELIPHAZ the Temanite answered and said, -- job 4:1
.
If we venture to converse with you, will you be offended? Yet who can restrain himself from speaking? -- job 4:2
.
Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands. -- job 4:3
.
Your words have held firm him who was falling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees. -- job 4:4
.
But now it is come upon you, and you faint and are grieved; it touches you, and you are troubled and dismayed. -- job 4:5
.
Is not your [reverent] fear of God your confidence and the integrity and uprightness of your ways your hope? -- job 4:6
.
Think [earnestly], I beg of you: who, being innocent, ever perished? Or where were those upright and in right standing with God cut off? -- job 4:7
.
As I myself have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble and mischief reap the same. -- job 4:8
.
By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed. -- job 4:9
.
The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken. -- job 4:10
.
The old and strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad. -- job 4:11
.
Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a whisper of it. -- job 4:12
.
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, -- job 4:13
.
Fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones shake. -- job 4:14
.
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up! -- job 4:15
.
[The spirit] stood still, but I could not discern the appearance of it. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, and then I heard a voice, saying, -- job 4:16
.
Can mortal man be just before God, or be more right than He is? Can a man be pure before his Maker, or be more cleansed than He is? -- job 4:17
.
Even in His [heavenly] servants He puts no trust or confidence, and His angels He charges with folly and error-- -- job 4:18
.
How much more those who dwell in houses (bodies) of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed like the moth. -- job 4:19
.
Between morning and evening they are destroyed; without anyone noticing it they perish forever. -- job 4:20
.
Is not their tent cord plucked up within them [so that the tent falls]? Do they not die, and that without [acquiring] wisdom? -- job 4:21
.
CALL NOW--is there any who will answer you? And to which of the holy [angels] will you turn? -- job 5:1
.
For vexation and rage kill the foolish man; jealousy and indignation slay the simple. -- job 5:2
.
I have seen the foolish taking root [and outwardly prospering], but suddenly I saw that his dwelling was cursed [for his doom was certain]. -- job 5:3
.
His children are far from safety; [involved in their father's ruin] they are crushed in the [court of justice in the city's] gate, and there is no one to deliver them. -- job 5:4
.
His harvest the hungry eat and take it even [when it grows] among the thorns; the snare opens for [his] wealth. -- job 5:5
.
For affliction comes not forth from the dust, neither does trouble spring forth out of the ground. -- job 5:6
.
But man is born to trouble as the sparks and the flames fly upward. -- job 5:7
.
As for me, I would seek God and inquire of and require Him, and to God would I commit my cause-- -- job 5:8
.
Who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number, -- job 5:9
.
Who gives rain upon the earth and sends waters upon the fields, -- job 5:10
.
So that He sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn He lifts to safety. -- job 5:11
.
He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise or anything of [lasting] worth. -- job 5:12
.
He catches the [so-called] wise in their own trickiness, and the counsel of the schemers is brought to a quick end. -- job 5:13
.
In the daytime they meet in darkness, and at noon they grope as in the night. -- job 5:14
.
But [God] saves [the fatherless] from the sword of their mouth, and the needy from the hand of the mighty. -- job 5:15
.
So the poor have hope, and iniquity shuts her mouth. -- job 5:16
.
Happy and fortunate is the man whom God reproves; so do not despise or reject the correction of the Almighty [subjecting you to trial and suffering]. -- job 5:17
.
For He wounds, but He binds up; He smites, but His hands heal. -- job 5:18
.
He will rescue you in six troubles; in seven nothing that is evil [for you] will touch you. -- job 5:19
.
In famine He will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword. -- job 5:20
.
You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes. -- job 5:21
.
At destruction and famine you shall laugh, neither shall you be afraid of the living creatures of the earth. -- job 5:22
.
For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. -- job 5:23
.
And you shall know that your tent shall be in peace, and you shall visit your fold and your dwelling and miss nothing [from them]. -- job 5:24
.
You shall know also that your children shall be many, and your offspring as the grass of the earth. -- job 5:25
.
You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, and as a shock of grain goes up [to the threshing floor] in its season. -- job 5:26
.
This is what we have searched out; it is true. Hear and heed it and know for yourself [for your good]. -- job 5:27
.
THEN JOB answered, -- job 6:1
.
Oh, that my impatience and vexation might be [thoroughly] weighed and all my calamity be laid up over against them in the balances, one against the other [to see if my grief is unmanly]! -- job 6:2
.
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash and wild, -- job 6:3
.
[But it is] because the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison which my spirit drinks up; the terrors of God set themselves in array against me. -- job 6:4
.
Does the wild ass bray when it has grass? Or does the ox low over its fodder? -- job 6:5
.
Can that which has no taste to it be eaten without salt? Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg? -- job 6:6
.
[These afflictions] my soul refuses to touch! Such things are like diseased food to me [sickening and repugnant]! -- job 6:7
.
Oh, that I might have my request, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! -- job 6:8
.
I even wish that it would please God to crush me, that He would let loose His hand and cut me off! -- job 6:9
.
Then would I still have consolation--yes, I would leap [for joy] amid unsparing pain [though I shrink from it]--that I have not concealed or denied the words of the Holy One! -- job 6:10
.
What strength have I left, that I should wait and hope? And what is ahead of me, that I should be patient? -- job 6:11
.
Is my strength and endurance that of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze? -- job 6:12
.
Is it not that I have no help in myself, and that wisdom is quite driven from me? -- job 6:13
.
To him who is about to faint and despair, kindness is due from his friend, lest he forsake the fear of the Almighty. -- job 6:14
.
[You] my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away, -- job 6:15
.
Which are black and turbid by reason of the ice, and in which the snows hides itself; -- job 6:16
.
When they get warm, they shrink and disappear; when it is hot, they vanish out of their place. -- job 6:17
.
The caravans which travel by way of them turn aside; they go into the waste places and perish. [Such is my disappointment in you, the friends I fully trusted.] -- job 6:18
.
The caravans of Tema looked [for water], the companies of Sheba waited for them [in vain]. -- job 6:19
.
They were confounded because they had hoped [to find water]; they came there and were bitterly disappointed. -- job 6:20
.
Now to me you are [like a dried-up brook]; you see my dismay and terror, and [believing me to be a victim of God's anger] you are afraid [to sympathize with me]. -- job 6:21
.
Did I ever say, Bring me a gift, or Pay a bribe on my account from your wealth -- job 6:22
.
To deliver me from the adversary's hand, or Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors? -- job 6:23
.
Teach me, and I will hold my peace; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. -- job 6:24
.
How forcible are words of straightforward speech! But what does your arguing argue and prove or your reproof reprove? -- job 6:25
.
Do you imagine your words to be an argument, but the speeches of one who is desperate to be as wind? -- job 6:26
.
Yes, you would cast lots over the fatherless and bargain away your friend. -- job 6:27
.
Now be pleased to look upon me, that it may be evident to you if I lie [for surely I would not lie to your face]. -- job 6:28
.
Return [from your suspicion], I pray you, let there be no injustice; yes, return again [to confidence in me], my vindication is in it. -- job 6:29
.
Is there wrong on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern what is destructive? -- job 6:30
.
IS THERE not an [appointed] warfare and hard labor to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling? -- job 7:1
.
As a servant earnestly longs for the shade and the evening shadows, and as a hireling who looks for the reward of his work, -- job 7:2
.
So am I allotted months of futile [suffering], and [long] nights of misery are appointed to me. -- job 7:3
.
When I lie down I say, When shall I arise and the night be gone? And I am full of tossing to and fro till the dawning of the day. -- job 7:4
.
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and has become loathsome, and it closes up and breaks out afresh. -- job 7:5
.
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. -- job 7:6
.
Oh, remember that my life is but wind (a puff, a breath, a sob); my eye shall see good no more. -- job 7:7
.
The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more; while your eyes are upon me, I shall be gone. -- job 7:8
.
As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol (the place of the dead) shall come up no more. -- job 7:9
.
He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. -- job 7:10
.
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul [O Lord]! -- job 7:11
.
Am I the sea, or the sea monster, that You set a watch over me? -- job 7:12
.
When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint, -- job 7:13
.
Then You scare me with dreams and terrify me through visions, -- job 7:14
.
So that I would choose strangling and death rather than these my bones. -- job 7:15
.
I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone, for my days are a breath (futility). -- job 7:16
.
What is man that You should magnify him and think him important? And that You should set Your mind upon him? -- job 7:17
.
And that You should visit him every morning and try him every moment? -- job 7:18
.
How long will Your [plaguing] glance not look away from me, nor You let me alone till I swallow my spittle? -- job 7:19
.
If I have sinned, what [harm] have I done You, O You Watcher and Keeper of men? Why have You set me as a mark for You, so that I am a burden to myself [and You]? -- job 7:20
.
And why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; and [even if] You will seek me diligently, [it will be too late, for] I shall not be. -- job 7:21
.
THEN ANSWERED Bildad the Shuhite, -- job 8:1
.
How long will you say these things [Job]? And how long shall the words of your mouth be as a mighty wind? -- job 8:2
.
Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness? -- job 8:3
.
If your children have sinned against Him, then He has delivered them into the power of their transgression. -- job 8:4
.
If you will seek God diligently and make your supplication to the Almighty, -- job 8:5
.
Then, if you are pure and upright, surely He will bestir Himself for you and make your righteous dwelling prosperous again. -- job 8:6
.
And though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase. -- job 8:7
.
For inquire, I pray you, of the former age and apply yourself to that which their fathers have searched out, -- job 8:8
.
For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow. -- job 8:9
.
Shall not [the forefathers] teach you and tell you and utter words out of their hearts (the deepest part of their nature)? -- job 8:10
.
Can the rush or papyrus grow up without marsh? Can the flag or reed grass grow without water? -- job 8:11
.
While it is yet green, in flower, and not cut down, it withers before any other herb [when without water]. -- job 8:12
.
So are the ways of all who forget God; and the hope of the godless shall perish. -- job 8:13
.
For his confidence breaks, and [the object of] his trust is a spider's web. -- job 8:14
.
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold fast to it, but it shall not last. -- job 8:15
.
He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden. -- job 8:16
.
[Godless] his roots are wrapped about the [stone] heap, and see their way [promisingly] among the rocks. -- job 8:17
.
But if [God] snatches him from his property, [then having passed into the hands of others] it [his property] will forget and deny him, [saying,] I have never seen you [before, as if ashamed of him--like his former friends]. -- job 8:18
.
See, this is the joy of going the way [of the ungodly]! And from the dust others will spring up [to take his place]. -- job 8:19
.
Behold, as surely as God will never uphold wrongdoers, He will never cast away a blameless man. -- job 8:20
.
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter [Job] and your lips with joyful shouting. -- job 8:21
.
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tents of the wicked shall be no more. -- job 8:22
.
THEN JOB answered and said, -- job 9:1
.
Yes, I know it is true. But how can mortal man be right before God? -- job 9:2
.
If one should want to contend with Him, he cannot answer one [of His questions] in a thousand. -- job 9:3
.
[God] is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has [ever] hardened himself against Him and prospered or even been safe? -- job 9:4
.
[God] Who removes the mountains, and they know it not when He overturns them in His anger; -- job 9:5
.
Who shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars of it tremble; -- job 9:6
.
Who commands the sun, and it rises not; Who seals up the stars [from view]; -- job 9:7
.
Who alone stretches out the heavens and treads upon the waves and high places of the sea; -- job 9:8
.
Who made [the constellations] the Bear, Orion, and the [loose cluster] Pleiades, and the [vast starry] spaces of the south; -- job 9:9
.
Who does great things past finding out, yes, marvelous things without number. -- job 9:10
.
Behold, He goes by me, and I see Him not; He passes on also, but I perceive Him not. -- job 9:11
.
Behold, He snatches away; who can hinder or turn Him back? Who will say to Him, What are You doing? -- job 9:12
.
God will not withdraw His anger; the [proud] helpers of Rahab [arrogant monster of the sea] bow under Him. -- job 9:13
.
How much less shall I answer Him, choosing out my words to reason with Him -- job 9:14
.
Whom, though I were righteous (upright and innocent) yet I could not answer? I must appeal for mercy to my Opponent and Judge [for my right]. -- job 9:15
.
If I called and He answered me, yet would I not believe that He listened to my voice. -- job 9:16
.
For He overwhelms and breaks me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause. -- job 9:17
.
He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness. -- job 9:18
.
If I speak of strength, behold, He is mighty! And if of justice, Who, says He, will summon Me? -- job 9:19
.
Though I am innocent and in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, He would prove me perverse. -- job 9:20
.
Though I am blameless, I regard not myself; I despise my life. -- job 9:21
.
It is all one; therefore I say, God [does not discriminate, but] destroys the blameless and the wicked. -- job 9:22
.
When [His] scourge slays suddenly, He mocks at the calamity and trial of the innocent. -- job 9:23
.
The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges [so that they are blinded to justice]. If it is not [God], who then is it [responsible for all this inequality]? -- job 9:24
.
Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good. -- job 9:25
.
They are passed away like the swift rowboats made of reeds, or like the eagle that swoops down on the prey. -- job 9:26
.
If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer and brighten up, -- job 9:27
.
I become afraid of all my pains and sorrows [yet to come], for I know You will not pronounce me innocent [by removing them]. -- job 9:28
.
I shall be held guilty and be condemned; why then should I labor in vain [to appear innocent]? -- job 9:29
.
If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye, -- job 9:30
.
Yet You will plunge me into the ditch, and my own clothes will abhor me [and refuse to cover so foul a body]. -- job 9:31
.
For [God] is not a [mere] man, as I am, that I should answer Him, that we should come together in court. -- job 9:32
.
There is no umpire between us, who might lay his hand upon us both, [would that there were!] -- job 9:33
.
That He might take His rod away from [threatening] me, and that the fear of Him might not terrify me. -- job 9:34
.
[Then] would I speak and not fear Him, but I am not so in myself [to make me afraid, were only a fair trial given me]. -- job 9:35
.
I AM weary of my life and loathe it! I will give free expression to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. -- job 10:1
.
I will say to God, Do not condemn me [do not make me guilty]! Show me why You contend with me. -- job 10:2
.
Does it seem good to You that You should oppress, that You should despise and reject the work of Your hands, and favor the schemes of the wicked? -- job 10:3
.
Have You eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees? -- job 10:4
.
Are Your days as the days of man, are Your years as man's [years], -- job 10:5
.
That You inquire after my iniquity and search for my sin-- -- job 10:6
.
Although You know that I am not wicked or guilty and that there is none who can deliver me out of Your hand? -- job 10:7
.
Your hands have formed me and made me. Would You turn around and destroy me? -- job 10:8
.
Remember [earnestly], I beseech You, that You have fashioned me as clay [out of the same earth material, exquisitely and elaborately]. And will You bring me into dust again? -- job 10:9
.
Have You not poured me out like milk and curdled me like cheese? -- job 10:10
.
You have clothed me with skin and flesh and have knit me together with bones and sinews. -- job 10:11
.
You have granted me life and favor, and Your providence has preserved my spirit. -- job 10:12
.
Yet these [the present evils] have You hid in Your heart [for me since my creation]; I know that this was with You [in Your purpose and thought]. -- job 10:13
.
If I sin, then You observe me, and You will not acquit me from my iniquity and guilt. -- job 10:14
.
If I am wicked, woe unto me! And if I am righteous, yet must I not lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and the sight of my affliction. -- job 10:15
.
If I lift myself up, You hunt me like a lion and again show Yourself [inflicting] marvelous [trials] upon me. -- job 10:16
.
You renew Your witnesses against me and increase Your indignation toward me; I am as if attacked by a troop time after time. -- job 10:17
.
Why then did You bring me forth out of the womb? Would that I had perished and no eye had seen me! -- job 10:18
.
I should have been as though I had not existed; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. -- job 10:19
.
Are not my days few? Cease then and let me alone, that I may take a little comfort and cheer up -- job 10:20
.
Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death, -- job 10:21
.
The land of sunless gloom as intense darkness, [the land] of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as thick darkness. -- job 10:22
.
THEN ZOPHAR the Naamathite replied, -- job 11:1
.
Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk [and making such great professions] be pronounced free from guilt or blame? -- job 11:2
.
Should your boastings and babble make men keep silent? And when you mock and scoff, shall no man make you ashamed? -- job 11:3
.
For you have said, My doctrine [that God afflicts the righteous knowingly] is pure, and I am clean in [God's] eyes. -- job 11:4
.
But oh, that God would speak, and open His lips against you, -- job 11:5
.
And that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For He is manifold in understanding! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your guilt and iniquity [deserve]. -- job 11:6
.
Can you find out the deep things of God, or can you by searching find out the limits of the Almighty [explore His depths, ascend to His heights, extend to His breadths, and comprehend His infinite perfection]? -- job 11:7
.
His wisdom is as high as the heights of heaven! What can you do? It is deeper than Sheol (the place of the dead)! What can you know? -- job 11:8
.
Longer in measure [and scope] is it than the earth, and broader than the sea. -- job 11:9
.
If [God] sweeps in and arrests and calls into judgment, who can hinder Him? [If He is against a man, who shall call Him to account for it?] -- job 11:10
.
For He recognizes and knows hollow, wicked, and useless men (men of falsehood); when He sees iniquity, will He not consider it? -- job 11:11
.
But a stupid man will get wisdom [only] when a wild donkey's colt is born a man [as when he thinks himself free because he is lifted up in pride]. -- job 11:12
.
If you set your heart aright and stretch out your hands to [God], -- job 11:13
.
If you put sin out of your hand and far away from you and let not evil dwell in your tents; -- job 11:14
.
Then can you lift up your face to Him without stain [of sin, and unashamed]; yes, you shall be steadfast and secure; you shall not fear. -- job 11:15
.
For you shall forget your misery; you shall remember it as waters that pass away. -- job 11:16
.
And [your] life shall be clearer than the noonday and rise above it; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning. -- job 11:17
.
And you shall be secure and feel confident because there is hope; yes, you shall search about you, and you shall take your rest in safety. -- job 11:18
.
You shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; yes, many shall sue for your favor. -- job 11:19
.
But the eyes of the wicked shall look [for relief] in vain, and they shall not escape [the justice of God]; and their hope shall be to give up the ghost. -- job 11:20
.
THEN JOB answered, -- job 12:1
.
No doubt you are the [only wise] people [in the world], and wisdom will die with you! -- job 12:2
.
But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these [of God's wisdom and might]? -- job 12:3
.
I am become one who is a laughingstock to his friend; I, one whom God answered when he called upon Him--a just, upright (blameless) man--laughed to scorn! -- job 12:4
.
In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune--but it is ready for those whose feet slip. -- job 12:5
.
The dwellings of robbers prosper; those who provoke God are [apparently] secure; God supplies them abundantly [who have no god but their own hands and power]. -- job 12:6
.
For ask now the animals, and they will teach you [that God does not deal with His creatures according to their character]; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you; -- job 12:7
.
Or speak to the earth [with its other forms of life], and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare [this truth] to you. -- job 12:8
.
Who [is so blind as] not to recognize in all these [that good and evil are promiscuously scattered throughout nature and human life] that it is God's hand which does it [and God's way]? -- job 12:9
.
In His hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind. -- job 12:10
.
Is it not the task of the ear to discriminate between [wise and unwise] words, just as the mouth distinguishes [between desirable and undesirable] food? -- job 12:11
.
With the aged [you say] is wisdom, and with length of days comes understanding. -- job 12:12
.
But [only] with [God] are [perfect] wisdom and might; He [alone] has [true] counsel and understanding. -- job 12:13
.
Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be built again; He shuts a man in, and none can open. -- job 12:14
.
He withholds the waters, and the land dries up; again, He sends forth [rains], and they overwhelm the land or transform it. -- job 12:15
.
With Him are might and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are His [and in His power]. -- job 12:16
.
He leads [great and scheming] counselors away stripped and barefoot and makes the judges fools [in human estimation, by overthrowing their plans]. -- job 12:17
.
He looses the fetters [ordered] by kings and has [the] waistcloth [of a slave] bound about their [own] loins. -- job 12:18
.
He leads away priests as spoil, and men firmly seated He overturns. -- job 12:19
.
He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment and discretion of the aged. -- job 12:20
.
He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong [disabling them, bringing low the pride of the learned]. -- job 12:21
.
He uncovers deep things out of darkness and brings into light black gloom and the shadow of death. -- job 12:22
.
He makes nations great, and He destroys them; He enlarges nations [and then straitens and shrinks them again], and leads them [away captive]. -- job 12:23
.
He takes away understanding from the leaders of the people of the land and of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no path. -- job 12:24
.
They grope in the dark without light, and He makes them to stagger and wander like a drunken man. -- job 12:25
.
[JOB CONTINUED:] Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it. -- job 13:1
.
What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. -- job 13:2
.
Surely I wish to speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue and reason my case with God [that He may explain the conflict between what I believe of Him and what I see of Him]. -- job 13:3
.
But you are forgers of lies [you defame my character most untruthfully]; you are all physicians of no value and have no remedy to offer. -- job 13:4
.
Oh, that you would altogether hold your peace! Then you would evidence your wisdom and you might pass for wise men. -- job 13:5
.
Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips. -- job 13:6
.
Will you speak unrighteously for God and talk deceitfully for Him? -- job 13:7
.
Will you show partiality to Him [be unjust to me in order to gain favor with Him]? Will you act as special pleaders for God? -- job 13:8
.
Would it be profitable for you if He should investigate your tactics [with me]? Or as one deceives and mocks a man, do you deceive and mock Him? -- job 13:9
.
He will surely reprove you if you do secretly show partiality. -- job 13:10
.
Shall not His majesty make you afraid, and should not your awe for Him restrain you? -- job 13:11
.
Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes [valueless]; your defenses are defenses of clay [and will crumble]. -- job 13:12
.
Hold your peace! Let me alone, so I may speak; and let come on me what may. -- job 13:13
.
Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hands [incurring the danger of God's wrath]? -- job 13:14
.
[I do it because, though He slay me, yet will I wait for and trust Him and] behold, He will slay me; I have no hope--nevertheless, I will maintain and argue my ways before Him and even to His face. -- job 13:15
.
This will be my salvation, that a polluted and godless man shall not come before Him. -- job 13:16
.
Listen diligently to my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears. -- job 13:17
.
Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified and vindicated. -- job 13:18
.
Who is he who will argue against and refute me? For then I would hold my peace and expire. -- job 13:19
.
Only [O Lord] grant two conditions to me, and then will I not hide myself from You: -- job 13:20
.
Withdraw Your hand and take this bodily suffering far from me; and let not my [reverent] dread of You terrify me. -- job 13:21
.
Then [Lord] call and I will answer, or let me speak, and You answer me. -- job 13:22
.
How many are my iniquities and sins [that so much sorrow should come to me]? Make me recognize and know my transgression and my sin. -- job 13:23
.
Why do You hide Your face [as if offended] and alienate me as if I were Your enemy? -- job 13:24
.
Will You harass and frighten a [poor, helpless] leaf driven to and fro, and will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble? -- job 13:25
.
For You write bitter things against me [in Your bill of indictment] and make me inherit and be accountable now for the iniquities of my youth. -- job 13:26
.
You put my feet also in the stocks and observe critically all my paths; You set a circle and limit around the soles of my feet [which I must not overstep]. -- job 13:27
.
And he wastes away as a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten. -- job 13:28
.
MAN WHO is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. -- job 14:1
.
He comes forth like a flower and withers; he flees also like a shadow and continues not. -- job 14:2
.
And [Lord] do You open Your eyes upon such a one, and bring me into judgment with You? -- job 14:3
.
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one! -- job 14:4
.
Since a man's days are already determined, and the number of his months is wholly in Your control, and he cannot pass the bounds of his allotted time-- -- job 14:5
.
[O God] turn from him [and cease to watch him so pitilessly]; let him rest until he has accomplished as does a hireling the appointed time for his day. -- job 14:6
.
For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that it will sprout again and that the tender shoots of it will not cease. [But there is no such hope for man.] -- job 14:7
.
Though its roots grow old in the earth and its stock dies in the ground, -- job 14:8
.
Yet through the scent [and breathing] of water [the stump of the tree] will bud and bring forth boughs like a young plant. -- job 14:9
.
But [the brave, strong] man must die and lie prostrate; yes, man breathes his last, and where is he? -- job 14:10
.
As waters evaporate from the lake, and the river drains and dries up, -- job 14:11
.
So man lies down and does not rise [to his former state]. Till the heavens are no more, men will not awake nor be raised [physically] out of their sleep. -- job 14:12
.
Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol (the unseen state), that You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, that You would set a definite time and then remember me earnestly [and imprint me on your heart]! -- job 14:13
.
If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare and service I will wait, till my change and release shall come. -- job 14:14
.
[Then] You would call and I would answer You; You would yearn for [me] the work of Your hands. -- job 14:15
.
But now You number each of my steps and take note of my every sin. -- job 14:16
.
My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You glue up my iniquity [to preserve it in full for the day of reckoning]. -- job 14:17
.
But as a mountain, if it falls, crumbles to nothing, and as the rock is removed out of its place, -- job 14:18
.
As waters wear away the stones and as floods wash away the soil of the earth, so You [O Lord] destroy the hope of man. -- job 14:19
.
You prevail forever against him, and he passes on; You change his appearance [in death] and send him away [from the presence of the living]. -- job 14:20
.
His sons come to honor, and he knows it not; they are brought low, and he perceives it not. -- job 14:21
.
But his body [lamenting its decay in the grave] shall grieve over him, and his soul shall mourn [over the body of clay which it once enlivened]. -- job 14:22
.
THEN ELIPHAZ the Temanite answered [Job], -- job 15:1
.
Should a wise man utter such windy knowledge [as we have just heard] and fill himself with the east wind [of withering, parching, and violent accusations]? -- job 15:2
.
Should he reason with unprofitable talk? Or with speeches with which he can do no good? -- job 15:3
.
Indeed, you are doing away with [reverential] fear, and you are hindering and diminishing meditation and devotion before God. -- job 15:4
.
For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty. -- job 15:5
.
Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; yes, your own lips testify against you. -- job 15:6
.
Are you the first man that was born [the original wise man]? Or were you created before the hills? -- job 15:7
.
Were you present to hear the secret counsel of God? And do you limit [the possession of] wisdom to yourself? -- job 15:8
.
What do you know that we know not? What do you understand that is not equally clear to us? -- job 15:9
.
Among us are both the gray-haired and the aged, older than your father by far. -- job 15:10
.
Are God's consolations [as we have interpreted them to you] too trivial for you? Is there any secret thing (any bosom sin) which you have not given up? [Or] were we too gentle [in our first speech] toward you to be effective? -- job 15:11
.
Why does your heart carry you away [why allow yourself to be controlled by feeling]? And why do your eyes flash [in anger or contempt], -- job 15:12
.
That you turn your spirit against God and let [such] words [as you have spoken] go out of your mouth? -- job 15:13
.
What is man, that he could be pure and clean? And he who is born of a woman, that he could be right and just? -- job 15:14
.
Behold, [God] puts no trust in His holy ones [the angels]; indeed, the heavens are not clean in His sight-- -- job 15:15
.
How much less that which is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water? -- job 15:16
.
I will show you, hear me; and that which I have seen I will relate, -- job 15:17
.
What wise men have not hid but have freely communicated; it was told to them by their fathers, -- job 15:18
.
Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger intruded or passed among them [corrupting the truth]. -- job 15:19
.
The wicked man suffers with [self-inflicted] torment all his days, through all the years that are numbered and laid up for him, the oppressor. -- job 15:20
.
A [dreadful] sound of terrors is in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him [the dwellings of robbers are not at peace]. -- job 15:21
.
He believes that he will not return out of darkness, and [because of his guilt] he is waited for by the sword [of God's vengeance]. -- job 15:22
.
He wanders abroad for food, saying, Where is it? He knows that the day of darkness and destruction is already close upon him. -- job 15:23
.
Distress and anguish terrify him; [he knows] they shall prevail against him, like a king ready for battle. -- job 15:24
.
Because he has stretched out his hand against God and bids defiance and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty, -- job 15:25
.
Running stubbornly against Him with a thickly ornamented shield; -- job 15:26
.
Because he has covered his face with his fat, adding layers of fat on his loins [giving himself up to animal pleasures], -- job 15:27
.
And has lived in desolate [God-forsaken] cities and in houses which no man should inhabit, which were destined to become heaps [of ruins]; -- job 15:28
.
He shall not be rich, neither shall his wealth last, neither shall his produce bend to the earth nor his possessions be extended on the earth. -- job 15:29
.
He shall not depart out of darkness [and escape from calamity; the wrath of God] shall consume him as flame consumes a dry tree, and by the blast of His mouth he shall be swept away. -- job 15:30
.
Let him not deceive himself and trust in vanity (emptiness, falseness, and futility), for these shall be his recompense [for such living]. -- job 15:31
.
It shall be accomplished and paid in full while he still lives, and his branch shall not be green [but shall wither away]. -- job 15:32
.
He shall fail to bring his grapes to maturity [leaving them to wither unnourished] on the vine and shall cast off blossoms [and fail to bring forth fruit] like the olive tree. -- job 15:33
.
For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery (wrong and injustice). -- job 15:34
.
They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, and their inmost soul hatches deceit. -- job 15:35
.
THEN JOB answered, -- job 16:1
.
I have heard many such things; wearisome and miserable comforters are you all! -- job 16:2
.
Will your futile words of wind have no end? Or what makes you so bold to answer [me like this]? -- job 16:3
.
I also could speak as you do, if you were in my stead; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you. -- job 16:4
.
[But] I would strengthen and encourage you with [the words of] my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would soothe your suffering. -- job 16:5
.
If I speak [to you miserable comforters], my sorrow is not soothed or lessened; and if I refrain [from speaking], in what way am I eased? [I hardly know whether to answer you or be silent.] -- job 16:6
.
But now [God] has taken away my strength. You [O Lord] have made desolate all my family and associates. -- job 16:7
.
You have laid firm hold on me and have shriveled me up, which is a witness against me; and my leanness [and wretched state of body] are further evidence [against me]; [they] testify to my face. -- job 16:8
.
[My adversary Satan] has torn [me] in his wrath and hated and persecuted me; he has gnashed upon me with his teeth; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me. -- job 16:9
.
[The forces of evil] have gaped at me with their mouths; they have struck me upon the cheek insolently; they massed themselves together and conspired unanimously against me. -- job 16:10
.
God has delivered me to the ungodly (to the evil one) and cast me [headlong] into the hands of the wicked (Satan's host). -- job 16:11
.
I was living at ease, but [Satan] crushed me and broke me apart; yes, he seized me by the neck and dashed me in pieces; then he set me up for his target. -- job 16:12
.
[Satan's] arrows whiz around me. He slashes open my vitals and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground. -- job 16:13
.
[Satan] stabs me, making breach after breach and attacking again and again; he runs at me like a giant and irresistible warrior. -- job 16:14
.
I have sewed sackcloth over my skin [as a sign of mourning] and have defiled my horn (my insignia of strength) in the dust. -- job 16:15
.
My face is red and swollen with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death [my eyes are dimmed], -- job 16:16
.
Although there is no guilt or violence in my hands and my prayer is pure. -- job 16:17
.
O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry have no resting-place [where it will cease being heard]. -- job 16:18
.
Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, and He who vouches for me is on high. -- job 16:19
.
My friends scorn me, but my eye pours out tears to God. -- job 16:20
.
Oh, that there might be one who would plead for a man with God and that he would maintain his right with Him, as a son of man pleads with or for his neighbor! -- job 16:21
.
For when a few years are come, I shall go the way from which I shall not return. -- job 16:22
.
MY SPIRIT is broken, my days are spent (snuffed out); the grave is ready for me. -- job 17:1
.
Surely there are mockers and mockery around me, and my eye dwells on their obstinacy, insults, and resistance. -- job 17:2
.
Give me a pledge with Yourself [acknowledge my innocence before my death]; who is there that will give security for me? -- job 17:3
.
But their hearts [Lord] You have closed to understanding; therefore You will not let them triumph [by giving them a verdict against me]. -- job 17:4
.
He who denounces his friends [in order to make them] a prey and get a share, the eyes of his children shall fail [to find food]. -- job 17:5
.
But He has made me a byword among the people, and they spit before my face. -- job 17:6
.
My eye has grown dim because of grief, and all my members are [wasted away] like a shadow. -- job 17:7
.
Upright men shall be astonished and appalled at this, and the innocent shall stir himself up against the godless and polluted. -- job 17:8
.
Yet shall the righteous (those upright and in right standing with God) hold to their ways, and he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger. -- job 17:9
.
But as for you, come on again, all of you, though I find not a wise man among you. -- job 17:10
.
My days are past, my purposes and plans are frustrated; even the thoughts (desires and possessions) of my heart [are broken off]. -- job 17:11
.
These [thoughts] extend from the night into the day, [so that] the light is short because of darkness. -- job 17:12
.
But if I look to Sheol (the unseen state) as my abode, if I spread my couch in the darkness, -- job 17:13
.
If I say to the grave and corruption, You are my father, and to the worm [that feeds on decay], You are my mother and my sister [because I will soon be closest to you], -- job 17:14
.
Where then is my hope? And if I have hope, who will see [its fulfillment]? -- job 17:15
.
[My hope] shall go down to the bars of Sheol (the unseen state) when once there is rest in the dust. -- job 17:16
.
THEN BILDAD the Shuhite answered, -- job 18:1
.
How long will you lay snares for words and have to hunt for your argument? Do some clear thinking, and then we will reply. -- job 18:2
.
Why are we counted as beasts [as if we had no sense]? Why are we unclean in your sight? -- job 18:3
.
You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place? -- job 18:4
.
Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the flame of his fire shall not shine. -- job 18:5
.
The light shall be dark in his dwelling, and his lamp beside him shall be put out. -- job 18:6
.
The steps of his strength shall be shortened, and his own counsel and the plans in which he trusted shall bring about his downfall. -- job 18:7
.
For the wicked is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks upon a lattice-covered pit. -- job 18:8
.
A trap will catch him by the heel, and a snare will lay hold on him. -- job 18:9
.
A noose is hidden for him on the ground and a trap for him in the way. -- job 18:10
.
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall chase him at his heels. -- job 18:11
.
The strength [of the wicked] shall be hunger-bitten, and calamity is ready at his side [if he halts]. -- job 18:12
.
By disease his strength and his skin shall be devoured; the firstborn of death [the worst of diseases] shall consume his limbs. -- job 18:13
.
He shall be rooted out of his dwelling place in which he trusted, and he shall be brought to the king of terrors [death]. -- job 18:14
.
There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his [family]; sulphur shall be scattered over his dwelling [to purify it after his going]. -- job 18:15
.
The roots [of the wicked] shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off and wither. -- job 18:16
.
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. -- job 18:17
.
He shall be thrust from light into darkness and driven out of the world. -- job 18:18
.
He shall neither have son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he sojourned. -- job 18:19
.
They [of the west] that come after [the wicked man] shall be astonished and appalled at his day, as they [of the east] that went before were seized with horror. -- job 18:20
.
Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly, and such is the place of him who knows not (recognizes not and honors not) God. -- job 18:21
.
THEN JOB answered: -- job 19:1
.
How long will you vex and torment me and break me in pieces with words? -- job 19:2
.
These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange [harden yourselves against me and deal severely with me]. -- job 19:3
.
And if it were true that I have erred, my error would remain with me [I would be conscious of it]. -- job 19:4
.
If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach and humiliation, -- job 19:5
.
Know that God has overthrown and put me in the wrong and has closed His net about me. -- job 19:6
.
Behold, I cry out, Violence! but I am not heard; I cry aloud for help, but there is no justice. -- job 19:7
.
He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, and He has set darkness upon my paths. -- job 19:8
.
He has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head. -- job 19:9
.
He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone; my hope has He pulled up like a tree. -- job 19:10
.
He has also kindled His wrath against me, and He counts me as one of His adversaries. -- job 19:11
.
His troops come together and cast up their way and siege works against me and encamp round about my tent. -- job 19:12
.
He has put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me. -- job 19:13
.
My kinsfolk have failed me, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. -- job 19:14
.
Those who live temporarily in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight. -- job 19:15
.
I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer, though I beseech him with words. -- job 19:16
.
I am repulsive to my wife and loathsome to the children of my own mother. -- job 19:17
.
Even young children despise me; when I get up, they speak against me. -- job 19:18
.
All the men of my council and my familiar friends abhor me; those whom I loved are turned against me. -- job 19:19
.
My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin or gums of my teeth. -- job 19:20
.
Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me! -- job 19:21
.
Why do you, as if you were God, pursue and persecute me? [Acting like wild beasts] why are you not satisfied with my flesh? -- job 19:22
.
Oh, that the words I now speak were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book [carved on a tablet of stone]! -- job 19:23
.
That with an iron pen and [molten] lead they were graven in the rock forever! -- job 19:24
.
For I know that my Redeemer and Vindicator lives, and at last He [the Last One] will stand upon the earth. -- job 19:25
.
And after my skin, even this body, has been destroyed, then from my flesh or without it I shall see God, -- job 19:26
.
Whom I, even I, shall see for myself and on my side! And my eyes shall behold Him, and not as a stranger! My heart pines away and is consumed within me. -- job 19:27
.
If you say, How we will pursue him! [and continue to persecute me with the claim] that the root [cause] of all these [afflictions] is found in me, -- job 19:28
.
Then beware and be afraid of the sword [of divine vengeance], for wrathful are the punishments of that sword, that you may know there is a judgment. -- job 19:29
.
THEN ZOPHAR the Naamathite answered, -- job 20:1
.
Therefore do my thoughts give me an answer, and I make haste [to offer it] for this reason. -- job 20:2
.
I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame, but out of my understanding my spirit answers me. -- job 20:3
.
Do you not know from of old, since the time that man was placed on the earth, -- job 20:4
.
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless and defiled is but for a moment? -- job 20:5
.
Though his [proud] height mounts up to the heavens and his head reaches to the clouds, -- job 20:6
.
Yet he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, Where is he? -- job 20:7
.
He will fly away like a dream and will not be found; yes, he will be chased away as a vision of the night. -- job 20:8
.
The eye which saw him will see him no more, neither will his [accustomed] place any more behold him. -- job 20:9
.
The poor will oppress his children, and his hands will give back his [ill-gotten] wealth. -- job 20:10
.
His bones are full of youthful energy, but it will lie down with him in the dust. -- job 20:11
.
Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue, -- job 20:12
.
Though he is loath to let it go but keeps it still within his mouth, -- job 20:13
.
Yet his food turns [to poison] in his stomach; it is the venom of asps within him. -- job 20:14
.
He has swallowed down [his ill-gotten] riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly. -- job 20:15
.
He shall suck the poison of asps [which ill-gotten wealth contains]; the viper's tongue shall slay him. -- job 20:16
.
He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter [to enjoy his wealth]. -- job 20:17
.
That which he labored for shall he give back and shall not swallow it down [to enjoy it]; according to his wealth shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice in it. -- job 20:18
.
For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has violently taken away a house which he did not build. -- job 20:19
.
Because his desire and greed knew no quietness within him, he will not save anything of that in which he delights. -- job 20:20
.
There was nothing left that he did not devour; therefore his prosperity will not endure. -- job 20:21
.
In the fullness of his sufficiency [in the time of his great abundance] he shall be poor and in straits; every hand of everyone who is in misery shall come upon him [he is but a wretch on every side]. -- job 20:22
.
When he is about to fill his belly [as in the wilderness when God sent the quails], God will cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him and will rain it upon him while he is eating. -- job 20:23
.
He will flee from the iron weapon, but the bow of bronze shall strike him through. -- job 20:24
.
[The arrow] is drawn forth and it comes out after passing through his body; yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors march in upon him; -- job 20:25
.
Every misfortune is laid up for his treasures. A fire not blown by man shall devour him; it shall consume what is left in his tent [and it shall go ill with him who remains there]. -- job 20:26
.
The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him. -- job 20:27
.
The produce and increase of his house will go into exile [with the victors], dragged away in the day of [God's] wrath. -- job 20:28
.
This is the wicked man's portion from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God. -- job 20:29
.
THEN JOB answered, -- job 21:1
.
Hear diligently my speech, and let this [your attention] be your consolation [given me]. -- job 21:2
.
Allow me, and I also will speak; and after I have spoken, mock on. -- job 21:3
.
As for me, is my complaint to man or of him? And why should I not be impatient and my spirit be troubled? -- job 21:4
.
Look at me and be astonished (appalled); and lay your hand upon your mouth. -- job 21:5
.
Even when I remember, I am troubled and afraid; horror and trembling take hold of my flesh. -- job 21:6
.
Why do the wicked live, become old, and become mighty in power? -- job 21:7
.
Their children are established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes. -- job 21:8
.
Their houses are safe and in peace, without fear; neither is the rod of God upon them. -- job 21:9
.
Their bull breeds and fails not; their cows calve and do not miscarry. -- job 21:10
.
They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children skip about. -- job 21:11
.
They themselves lift up their voices and sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe. -- job 21:12
.
They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol (the unseen state) in a moment and peacefully. -- job 21:13
.
Yet they say to God, Depart from us, for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways. -- job 21:14
.
Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him? -- job 21:15
.
But notice, [you say] the prosperity of the wicked is not in their power; the mystery [of God's dealings] with the ungodly is far from my comprehension. -- job 21:16
.
How often [then] is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains and sorrows to them in His anger? -- job 21:17
.
That they are like stubble before the wind and like chaff that the storm steals and carries away? -- job 21:18
.
You say, God lays up [the punishment of the wicked man's] iniquity for his children. Let Him recompense it to the man himself, that he may know and feel it. -- job 21:19
.
Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. -- job 21:20
.
For what pleasure or interest has a man in his house and family after he is dead, when the number of his months is cut off? -- job 21:21
.
Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing that He judges those who are on high? -- job 21:22
.
One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet; -- job 21:23
.
His pails are full of milk [his veins are filled with nourishment], and the marrow of his bones is fresh and moist, -- job 21:24
.
Whereas another man dies in bitterness of soul and never tastes of pleasure or good fortune. -- job 21:25
.
They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm spreads a covering over them. -- job 21:26
.
Behold, I know your thoughts and plans and the devices with which you would wrong me. -- job 21:27
.
For you say, Where is the house of the rich and liberal prince [meaning me]? And where is the tent in which the wicked [Job] dwelt? -- job 21:28
.
Have you not asked those who travel this way, and do you not accept their testimony and evidences-- -- job 21:29
.
That the evil man is [now] spared in the day of calamity and destruction, and they are led forth and away on the day of [God's] wrath? -- job 21:30
.
But who declares [a man's] way [and rebukes] him to his face? And who pays him back for what he has done? -- job 21:31
.
When he is borne to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb. -- job 21:32
.
The clods of the valley are sweet to him, and every man shall follow him to a grave, as innumerable people [have gone] before him. -- job 21:33
.
How then can you comfort me with empty and futile words, since in your replies there lurks falsehood? -- job 21:34
.
THEN ELIPHAZ the Temanite answered [Job], -- job 22:1
.
Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he that is wise is profitable to himself. -- job 22:2
.
Is it any pleasure or advantage to the Almighty that you are righteous (upright and in right standing with Him)? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect? -- job 22:3
.
Is it for your [reverential] fear of Him that He [thus] reproves you, that He enters with you into judgment? -- job 22:4
.
Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities. -- job 22:5
.
For you have taken pledges of your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing. -- job 22:6
.
You have not given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. -- job 22:7
.
But [you, Job] the man with power possessed the land, and the favored and accepted man dwelt in it. -- job 22:8
.
You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. -- job 22:9
.
Therefore snares are round about you, and sudden fear troubles and overwhelms you; -- job 22:10
.
Your light is darkened, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. -- job 22:11
.
Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! -- job 22:12
.
Therefore you say, How and what does God know [about me]? Can He judge through the thick darkness? -- job 22:13
.
Thick clouds are a covering to Him, so that He does not see, and He walks on the vault of the heavens. -- job 22:14
.
Will you pay attention and keep to the old way that wicked men trod [in Noah's time], -- job 22:15
.
Men who were snatched away before their time, whose foundations were poured out like a stream [during the flood]? -- job 22:16
.
They said to God, Depart from us, and, What can the Almighty do for or to us? -- job 22:17
.
Yet He filled their houses with good [things]. But the counsel of the ungodly is far from me. -- job 22:18
.
The righteous see it and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn [saying], -- job 22:19
.
Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, and that which remained to them the fire has consumed. -- job 22:20
.
Acquaint now yourself with Him [agree with God and show yourself to be conformed to His will] and be at peace; by that [you shall prosper and great] good shall come to you. -- job 22:21
.
Receive, I pray you, the law and instruction from His mouth and lay up His words in your heart. -- job 22:22
.
If you return to the Almighty [and submit and humble yourself before Him], you will be built up; if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents, -- job 22:23
.
If you lay gold in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brook [considering them of little worth], -- job 22:24
.
And make the Almighty your gold and [the Lord] your precious silver treasure, -- job 22:25
.
Then you will have delight in the Almighty, and you will lift up your face to God. -- job 22:26
.
You will make your prayer to Him, and He will hear you, and you will pay your vows. -- job 22:27
.
You shall also decide and decree a thing, and it shall be established for you; and the light [of God's favor] shall shine upon your ways. -- job 22:28
.
When they make [you] low, you will say, [There is] a lifting up; and the humble person He lifts up and saves. -- job 22:29
.
He will even deliver the one [for whom you intercede] who is not innocent; yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands. -- job 22:30
.
THEN JOB answered, -- job 23:1
.
Even today is my complaint rebellious and bitter; my stroke is heavier than my groaning. -- job 23:2
.
Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to His seat! -- job 23:3
.
I would lay my cause before Him and fill my mouth with arguments. -- job 23:4
.
I would learn what He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me. -- job 23:5
.
Would He plead against me with His great power? No, He would give heed to me. -- job 23:6
.
There the righteous [one who is upright and in right standing with God] could reason with Him; so I should be acquitted by my Judge forever. -- job 23:7
.
Behold, I go forward [and to the east], but He is not there; I go backward [and to the west], but I cannot perceive Him; -- job 23:8
.
On the left hand [and to the north] where He works [I seek Him], but I cannot behold Him; He turns Himself to the right hand [and to the south], but I cannot see Him. -- job 23:9
.
But He knows the way that I take [He has concern for it, appreciates, and pays attention to it]. When He has tried me, I shall come forth as refined gold [pure and luminous]. -- job 23:10
.
My foot has held fast to His steps; His ways have I kept and not turned aside. -- job 23:11
.
I have not gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have esteemed and treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food. -- job 23:12
.
But He is unchangeable, and who can turn Him? And what He wants to do, that He does. -- job 23:13
.
For He performs [that which He has] planned for me, and of many such matters He is mindful. -- job 23:14
.
Therefore am I troubled and terrified at His presence; when I consider, I am in dread and afraid of Him. -- job 23:15
.
For God has made my heart faint, timid, and broken, and the Almighty has terrified me, -- job 23:16
.
Because I was not cut off before the darkness [of these woes befell me], neither has He covered the thick darkness from my face. -- job 23:17
.
WHY [seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty] does He not set seasons for judgment? Why do those who know Him see not His days [for punishment of the wicked]? -- job 24:1
.
Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks and pasture them [appropriating land and flocks openly]. -- job 24:2
.
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge. -- job 24:3
.
They crowd the poor and needy off the road; the poor and meek of the earth all hide themselves. -- job 24:4
.
Behold, as wild asses in the desert, [the poor] go forth to their work, seeking diligently for prey and food; the wilderness yields them bread for their children [in roots and herbage]. -- job 24:5
.
They reap each one his fodder in a field [that is not his own], and they glean the vintage of the wicked man. -- job 24:6
.
They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold. -- job 24:7
.
They are wet with the showers of the mountains and cling to the rock for want of shelter. -- job 24:8
.
[The violent men whose wickedness seems unnoticed] pluck the fatherless infants from the breast [to sell or make them slaves], and take [the clothing on] the poor for a pledge, -- job 24:9
.
So that the needy go about naked for lack of clothing, and though hungry, they must carry [but not eat from] the sheaves. -- job 24:10
.
Among the olive rows [of the wicked, the poor] make oil; they tread [the fresh juice of the grape from] the presses, but suffer thirst. -- job 24:11
.
From out of the populous city men groan, and the very life of the wounded cries for help; yet God [seemingly] regards not the wrong done them. -- job 24:12
.
These wrongdoers are of those who rebel against the light; they know not its ways nor stay in its paths. -- job 24:13
.
The murderer rises with the light; he kills the poor and the needy, and in the night he becomes as a thief. -- job 24:14
.
The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me, and he puts a disguise upon his face. -- job 24:15
.
In the dark, they dig through [the penetrable walls of] houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the sunlight. -- job 24:16
.
For midnight is morning to all of them; for they are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness. -- job 24:17
.
[You say] Swiftly such men pass away on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; [no treader] turns into their vineyards. -- job 24:18
.
Drought and heat consume the snow waters; so does Sheol (the place of the dead) those who have sinned. -- job 24:19
.
The womb shall forget him, the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered, and unrighteousness shall be broken like a tree [which cannot be healed]. -- job 24:20
.
[The evil man] preys upon the barren, childless woman and does no good to the widow. -- job 24:21
.
Yet [God] prolongs the life of the [wicked] mighty by His power; they rise up when they had despaired of life. -- job 24:22
.
God gives them security, and they rest on it; and His eyes are upon their ways. -- job 24:23
.
They are exalted for a little while, and then are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others are and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain. -- job 24:24
.
And if this is not so, who will prove me a liar and make my speech worthless? -- job 24:25
.
THEN BILDAD the Shuhite answered, -- job 25:1
.
Dominion and fear are with [God]; He makes peace in His high places. -- job 25:2
.
Is there any number to His armies? And upon whom does not His light arise? -- job 25:3
.
How then can man be justified and righteous before God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be pure and clean? -- job 25:4
.
Behold, even the moon has no brightness [compared to God's glory] and the stars are not pure in His sight-- -- job 25:5
.
How much less man, who is a maggot! And a son of man, who is a worm! -- job 25:6
.
BUT JOB answered, -- job 26:1
.
How you have helped him who is without power! How you have sustained the arm that is without strength! -- job 26:2
.
How you have counseled him who has no wisdom! And how plentifully you have declared to him sound knowledge! -- job 26:3
.
With whose assistance have you uttered these words? And whose spirit [inspired what] came forth from you? -- job 26:4
.
The shades of the dead tremble underneath the waters and their inhabitants. -- job 26:5
.
Sheol (the place of the dead) is naked before God, and Abaddon (the place of destruction) has no covering [from His eyes]. -- job 26:6
.
He it is Who spreads out the northern skies over emptiness and hangs the earth upon or over nothing. -- job 26:7
.
He holds the waters bound in His clouds [which otherwise would spill on earth all at once], and the cloud is not rent under them. -- job 26:8
.
He covers the face of His throne and spreads over it His cloud. -- job 26:9
.
He has placed an enclosing limit [the horizon] upon the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. -- job 26:10
.
The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at His rebuke. -- job 26:11
.
He stills or stirs up the sea by His power, and by His understanding He smites proud Rahab. -- job 26:12
.
By His breath the heavens are garnished; His hand pierced the [swiftly] fleeing serpent. -- job 26:13
.
Yet these are but [a small part of His doings] the outskirts of His ways or the mere fringes of His force, the faintest whisper of His voice! Who dares contemplate or who can understand the thunders of His full, magnificent power? -- job 26:14
.
JOB AGAIN took up his discourse and said, -- job 27:1
.
As God lives, Who has taken away my right and denied me justice, and the Almighty, Who has vexed and embittered my life, -- job 27:2
.
As long as my life is still whole within me, and the breath of God is [yet] in my nostrils, -- job 27:3
.
My lips shall not speak untruth, nor shall my tongue utter deceit. -- job 27:4
.
God forbid that I should justify you--saying you are right [in your accusations against me]; till I die, I will not put away my integrity from me. -- job 27:5
.
My uprightness and my right standing with God I hold fast and will not let them go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days and it shall not reproach me as long as I live. -- job 27:6
.
Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous. -- job 27:7
.
For what is the hope of the godless and polluted, even though he has gained [in this world], when God cuts him off and takes away his life? -- job 27:8
.
Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him? -- job 27:9
.
Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times? -- job 27:10
.
I will teach you regarding the hand and handiwork of God; that which is with the Almighty [God's actual treatment of the wicked man] will I not conceal. -- job 27:11
.
Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain [cherishing foolish notions]? -- job 27:12
.
This [which I am about to tell] is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage which oppressors shall receive from the Almighty: -- job 27:13
.
If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring will not have sufficient bread. -- job 27:14
.
Those who survive him, [the pestilence] will bury, and [their] widows will make no lamentation. -- job 27:15
.
Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up clothing like clay, -- job 27:16
.
He may prepare it, but the just will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver. -- job 27:17
.
He builds his house like a moth or a spider, like a booth which a watchman makes [to last for a season]. -- job 27:18
.
[The wicked] will lie down rich, but does it not again; he opens his eyes, and [his wealth] is gone. -- job 27:19
.
Terrors overtake him like a [suddenly loosened] flood; a windstorm steals him away in the night. -- job 27:20
.
The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. -- job 27:21
.
For [God and the storm] hurl at him without pity and unsparingly [their thunderbolts of wrath]; he flees in haste before His power. -- job 27:22
.
[God causes] men to clap their hands at him [in malignant joy] and hiss him out of his place. -- job 27:23
.
SURELY THERE is a mine for silver, and a place for gold where they refine it. -- job 28:1
.
Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the stone ore. -- job 28:2
.
Man sets an end to darkness, and he searches out the farthest bounds for the ore buried in gloom and deep darkness. -- job 28:3
.
Men break open shafts away from where people sojourn, in places forgotten by [human] foot; and [descend into them], hanging afar from men, they swing or flit to and fro. -- job 28:4
.
As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath [its surface, down deep in the mine] there is blasting, turning it up as by fire. -- job 28:5
.
Its stones are the bed of sapphires; it holds dust of gold [which he wins]. -- job 28:6
.
That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it. -- job 28:7
.
The proud beasts [and their young] have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed over it. -- job 28:8
.
Man puts forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots. -- job 28:9
.
He cuts out channels and passages among the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing. -- job 28:10
.
[Man] binds the streams so that they do not trickle [into the mine], and the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light. -- job 28:11
.
But where shall Wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? -- job 28:12
.
Man knows not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living. -- job 28:13
.
The deep says, [Wisdom] is not in me; and the sea says, It is not with me. -- job 28:14
.
It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price of it. -- job 28:15
.
It cannot be valued in [terms of] the gold of Ophir, in the precious onyx or beryl, or the sapphire. -- job 28:16
.
Gold and glass cannot equal [Wisdom], nor can it be exchanged for jewels or vessels of fine gold. -- job 28:17
.
No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; for the possession of Wisdom is even above rubies or pearls. -- job 28:18
.
The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare with it, nor can it be valued in pure gold. -- job 28:19
.
From where then does Wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? -- job 28:20
.
It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and knowledge of it is withheld from the birds of the heavens. -- job 28:21
.
Abaddon (the place of destruction) and Death say, We have [only] heard the report of it with our ears. -- job 28:22
.
God understands the way [to Wisdom] and He knows the place of it [Wisdom is with God alone]. -- job 28:23
.
For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. -- job 28:24
.
When He gave to the wind weight or pressure and allotted the waters by measure, -- job 28:25
.
When He made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder, -- job 28:26
.
Then He saw [Wisdom] and declared it; He established it, yes, and searched it out [for His own use, and He alone possesses it]. -- job 28:27
.
But to man He said, Behold, the reverential and worshipful fear of the Lord--that is Wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. -- job 28:28
.
AND JOB again took up his discussion and said, -- job 29:1
.
Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me, -- job 29:2
.
When His lamp shone above and upon my head and by His light I walked through darkness; -- job 29:3
.
As I was in the [prime] ripeness of my days, when the friendship and counsel of God were over my tent, -- job 29:4
.
When the Almighty was yet with me and my children were about me, -- job 29:5
.
When my steps [through rich pasturage] were washed with butter and the rock poured out for me streams of oil! -- job 29:6
.
When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the street [the broad place for the council at the city's gate], -- job 29:7
.
The young men saw me and hid themselves; the aged rose up and stood; -- job 29:8
.
The princes refrained from talking and laid their hands on their mouths; -- job 29:9
.
The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues cleaved to the roof of their mouths. -- job 29:10
.
For when the ear heard, it called me happy and blessed me; and when the eye saw, it testified for me [approvingly], -- job 29:11
.
Because I delivered the poor who cried, the fatherless and him who had none to help him. -- job 29:12
.
The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. -- job 29:13
.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me or clothed itself with me; my justice was like a robe and a turban or a diadem or a crown! -- job 29:14
.
I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. -- job 29:15
.
I was a father to the poor and needy; the cause of him I did not know I searched out. -- job 29:16
.
And I broke the jaws or the big teeth of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth. -- job 29:17
.
Then I said, I shall die in or beside my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. -- job 29:18
.
My root is spread out and open to the waters, and the dew lies all night upon my branch. -- job 29:19
.
My glory and honor are fresh in me [being constantly renewed], and my bow gains [ever] new strength in my hand. -- job 29:20
.
Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel. -- job 29:21
.
After I spoke, they did not speak again, and my speech dropped upon them [like a refreshing shower]. -- job 29:22
.
And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths wide as for the spring rain. -- job 29:23
.
I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and their depression did not cast down the light of my countenance. -- job 29:24
.
I chose their way [for them] and sat as [their] chief, and dwelt like a king among his soldiers, like one who comforts mourners. -- job 29:25
.
BUT NOW they who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. -- job 30:1
.
Yes, how could the strength of their hands profit me? They were men whose ripe age and vigor had perished. -- job 30:2
.
They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry and barren ground or flee into the wilderness, into the gloom of wasteness and desolation. -- job 30:3
.
They pluck saltwort or mallows among the bushes, and roots of the broom for their food or to warm them. -- job 30:4
.
They are driven from among men, who shout after them as after a thief. -- job 30:5
.
They must dwell in the clefts of frightful valleys (gullies made by torrents) and in holes of the earth and of the rocks. -- job 30:6
.
Among the bushes they bray and howl [like wild animals]; beneath the prickly scrub they fling themselves and huddle together. -- job 30:7
.
Sons of the worthless and nameless, they have been scourged and crushed out of the land. -- job 30:8
.
And now I have become their song; yes, I am a byword to them. -- job 30:9
.
They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and do not refrain from spitting in my face or at the sight of me. -- job 30:10
.
For God has loosed my bowstring and afflicted and humbled me; they have cast off the bridle [of restraint] before me. -- job 30:11
.
On my right hand rises the rabble brood; they jostle me and push away my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction [like an advancing army]. -- job 30:12
.
They break up and clutter my path [embarrassing my plans]; they urge on my calamity, even though they have no helper [and are themselves helpless]. -- job 30:13
.
As through a wide breach they come in; amid the crash [of falling walls] they roll themselves upon me. -- job 30:14
.
Terrors are turned upon me; my honor and reputation they chase away like the wind, and my welfare has passed away as a cloud. -- job 30:15
.
And now my life is poured out within me; the days of affliction have gripped me. -- job 30:16
.
My bones are pierced [with aching] in the night season, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest. -- job 30:17
.
By the great force [of my disease] my garment is disguised and disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my coat. -- job 30:18
.
[God] has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes. -- job 30:19
.
I cry to You, [Lord,] and You do not answer me; I stand up, but You [only] gaze [indifferently] at me. -- job 30:20
.
You have become harsh and cruel to me; with the might of Your hand You [keep me alive only to] persecute me. -- job 30:21
.
You lift me up on the wind; You cause me to ride upon it, and You toss me about in the tempest. -- job 30:22
.
For I know that You will bring me to death and to the house [of meeting] appointed for all the living. -- job 30:23
.
However, does not one falling in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand? Or in his calamity will he not therefore cry for help? -- job 30:24
.
Did not I weep for him who was in trouble? Was not my heart grieved for the poor and needy? -- job 30:25
.
But when I looked for good, then evil came to me; and when I waited for light, there came darkness. -- job 30:26
.
My heart is troubled and does not rest; days of affliction come to meet me. -- job 30:27
.
I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the congregation and cry for help. -- job 30:28
.
I am a brother to jackals [which howl], and a companion to ostriches [which scream dismally]. -- job 30:29
.
My skin falls from me in blackened flakes, and my bones are burned with heat. -- job 30:30
.
Therefore my lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep. -- job 30:31
.
I DICTATED a covenant (an agreement) to my eyes; how then could I look [lustfully] upon a girl? -- job 31:1
.
For what portion should I have from God above [if I were lewd], and what heritage from the Almighty on high? -- job 31:2
.
Does not calamity [justly] befall the unrighteous, and disaster the workers of iniquity? -- job 31:3
.
Does not [God] see my ways and count all my steps? -- job 31:4
.
If I have walked with falsehood or vanity, or if my foot has hastened to deceit-- -- job 31:5
.
Oh, let me be weighed in a just balance and let Him weigh me, that God may know my integrity! -- job 31:6
.
If my step has turned out of [God's] way, and my heart has gone the way my eyes [covetously] invited, and if any spot has stained my hands with guilt, -- job 31:7
.
Then let me sow and let another eat; yes, let the produce of my field or my offspring be rooted out. -- job 31:8
.
If my heart has been deceived and I made a fool by a woman, or if I have [covetously] laid wait at my neighbor's door [until his departure], -- job 31:9
.
Then let my wife grind [meal, like a bondslave] for another, and let others bow down upon her. -- job 31:10
.
For [adultery] is a heinous and chief crime, an iniquity [to demand action by] the judges and punishment. -- job 31:11
.
For [uncontrolled passion] is a fire which consumes to Abaddon (to destruction, ruin, and the place of final torment); [that fire once lighted would rage until all is consumed] and would burn to the root all my [life's] increase. -- job 31:12
.
If I have despised and rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant when they contended or brought a complaint against me, -- job 31:13
.
What then shall I do when God rises up [to judge]? When He visits [to inquire of me], what shall I answer Him? -- job 31:14
.
Did not He Who made me in the womb make [my servant]? And did not One fashion us both in the womb? -- job 31:15
.
If I have withheld from the poor and needy what they desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to look in vain [for relief], -- job 31:16
.
Or have eaten my morsel alone and have not shared it with the fatherless-- -- job 31:17
.
No, but from my youth [the fatherless] grew up with me as a father, and I have been [the widow's] guide from my mother's womb-- -- job 31:18
.
If I have seen anyone perish for want of clothing, or any poor person without covering, -- job 31:19
.
If his loins have not blessed me [for clothing them], and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep, -- job 31:20
.
If I have lifted my hand against the fatherless when I saw [that the judges would be favorable and be] my help at the [council] gate, -- job 31:21
.
Then let my shoulder fall away from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from its socket. -- job 31:22
.
For calamity from God was a terror to me, and because of His majesty I could not endure [to face Him] and could do nothing. -- job 31:23
.
If I have made gold my trust and hope or have said to fine gold, You are my confidence, -- job 31:24
.
If I rejoiced because my wealth was great and because my [powerful] hand [alone] had gotten much, -- job 31:25
.
If I beheld [as an object of worship] the sunlight when it shone or the moon walking in its brightness, -- job 31:26
.
And my heart has been secretly enticed by them or my mouth has kissed my hand [in homage to them], -- job 31:27
.
This also would have been [a heinous and principal] iniquity to demand the judges' action and punishment, for I would have denied and been false to the God Who is above. -- job 31:28
.
If I rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me or lifted myself up [in malicious triumph] when evil overtook him-- -- job 31:29
.
No, I have let my mouth sin neither by cursing my enemy nor by praying that he might die-- -- job 31:30
.
[Just ask] if the men of my tent will not say, Who can find one in need who has not been satisfied with food he gave them?-- -- job 31:31
.
The temporary resident has not lodged in the street, but I have opened my door to the wayfaring man-- -- job 31:32
.
If like Adam or like [other] men I have concealed my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom -- job 31:33
.
Because I feared the great multitude and the contempt of families terrified me so that I kept silence and did not go out of the door-- -- job 31:34
.
Oh, for a hearing! Oh, for an answer from the Almighty! Let my adversary write out His indictment [and put His vague accusations in tangible form] in a book! -- job 31:35
.
Surely I would [proudly] bear it on my shoulder and wind the scroll about my head as a diadem. -- job 31:36
.
I would count out to Him the number of my steps [with every detail of my life], approaching His presence as a prince-- -- job 31:37
.
For if my land has cried out against me and its furrows have complained together with tears [that I have no right to them], -- job 31:38
.
If I have eaten its fruits without paying for them or have caused its [rightful] owners to breathe their last, -- job 31:39
.
Let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockleburs instead of barley. The [controversial] words of Job [with his friends] are ended. -- job 31:40
.
SO THESE three men ceased to answer Job, because he was [rigidly] righteous (upright and in right standing with God) in his own eyes. [But there was a fifth man there also.] -- job 32:1
.
Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became indignant. His indignation was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God [even made himself out to be better than God]. -- job 32:2
.
Also against [Job's] three friends was [Elihu's] anger kindled, because they had found no answer [were unable to show his real error], and yet they had declared him to be in the wrong [and responsible for his own afflictions]. -- job 32:3
.
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he. -- job 32:4
.
But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry. -- job 32:5
.
Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite said, I am young, and you are aged; for that reason I was timid and restrained and dared not declare my opinion to you. -- job 32:6
.
I said, Age should speak, and a multitude of years should teach wisdom [so let it be heard]. -- job 32:7
.
But there is [a vital force] a spirit [of intelligence] in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives men understanding. -- job 32:8
.
It is not the great [necessarily] who are wise, nor [always] the aged who understand justice. -- job 32:9
.
So I say, Listen to me; I also will give you my opinion [about Job's situation] and my knowledge. -- job 32:10
.
You see, I waited for your words, I listened to your wise reasons, while you searched out what to say. -- job 32:11
.
Yes, I paid attention to what you said, and behold, not one of you convinced Job or made [satisfactory] replies to his words [you could not refute him]. -- job 32:12
.
Beware lest you say, We have found wisdom; God thrusts [Job] down [justly], not man [God alone is dealing with him]. -- job 32:13
.
Now [Job] has not directed his words against me [therefore I have no cause for irritation], neither will I answer him with speeches like yours. [I speak for truth, not for revenge.] -- job 32:14
.
[Job's friends] are amazed and embarrassed, they answer no more; they have not a thing to say [reports Elihu]. -- job 32:15
.
And shall I wait, because they say nothing but stand still and answer no more? -- job 32:16
.
I also will answer my [God-assigned] part; I also will declare my opinion and my knowledge. -- job 32:17
.
For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me. -- job 32:18
.
My breast is as wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst. -- job 32:19
.
I must speak, that I may get relief and be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer. -- job 32:20
.
I will not [I warn you] be influenced by respect for any man's person and show partiality, neither will I flatter any man. -- job 32:21
.
For I know not how to flatter, [wasting my time in mere formalities, for then] my Maker would soon take me away. -- job 32:22
.
BE THAT as it may, Job, I beg of you to hear what I have to say and give heed to all my words. -- job 33:1
.
Behold, here I am with open mouth; here is my tongue talking. -- job 33:2
.
My words shall express the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall speak what they know with utter sincerity. -- job 33:3
.
[It is] the Spirit of God that made me [which has stirred me up], and the breath of the Almighty that gives me life [which inspires me]. -- job 33:4
.
Answer me now, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand. -- job 33:5
.
Behold, I am toward God and before Him even as you are; I also am formed out of the clay [though I speak with abnormal wisdom because of a divine illumination]. -- job 33:6
.
See my terror [for I am only a fellow mortal, not God]; I shall not make you afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon you. -- job 33:7
.
Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying, -- job 33:8
.
I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me. -- job 33:9
.
But behold, God finds occasions against me and causes of alienation and indifference; He counts me as His enemy. -- job 33:10
.
He puts my feet in the stocks; He [untrustingly] watches all my paths [you say]. -- job 33:11
.
I reply to you, Behold, in this you are not just; God is superior to man. -- job 33:12
.
Why do you contend against Him? For He does not give account of any of His actions. [Sufficient for us it should be to know that it is He Who does them.] -- job 33:13
.
For God [does reveal His will; He] speaks not only once, but more than once, even though men do not regard it [including you, Job]. -- job 33:14
.
[One may hear God's voice] in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men while slumbering upon the bed, -- job 33:15
.
Then He opens the ears of men and seals their instruction [terrifying them with warnings], -- job 33:16
.
That He may withdraw man from his purpose and cut off pride from him [disgusting him with his own disappointing self-sufficiency]. -- job 33:17
.
He holds him back from the pit [of destruction], and his life from perishing by the sword [of God's destructive judgments]. -- job 33:18
.
[God's voice may be heard by man when] he is chastened with pain upon his bed and with continual strife in his bones or while all his bones are firmly set, -- job 33:19
.
So that his desire makes him loathe food, and even dainty dishes [nauseate him]. -- job 33:20
.
His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out. -- job 33:21
.
Yes, his soul draws near to corruption, and his life to the inflicters of death (the destroyers). -- job 33:22
.
[God's voice may be heard] if there is for the hearer a messenger or an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him [how to be upright and in right standing with God], -- job 33:23
.
Then [God] is gracious to him and says, Deliver him from going down into the pit [of destruction]; I have found a ransom (a price of redemption, an atonement)! -- job 33:24
.
[Then the man's] flesh shall be restored; it becomes fresher and more tender than a child's; he returns to the days of his youth. -- job 33:25
.
He prays to God, and He is favorable to him, so that he sees His face with joy; for [God] restores to him his righteousness (his uprightness and right standing with God--with its joys). -- job 33:26
.
He looks upon other men or sings out to them, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it did not profit me, or He did not requite me [according to my iniquity]! -- job 33:27
.
[God] has redeemed my life from going down to the pit [of destruction], and my life shall see the light! -- job 33:28
.
[Elihu comments] Behold, God does all these things twice, yes, three times, with a man, -- job 33:29
.
To bring back his life from the pit [of destruction], that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. -- job 33:30
.
Give heed, O Job, listen to me; hold your peace, and I will speak. -- job 33:31
.
If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you. -- job 33:32
.
If [you do] not [have anything to say], listen to me; hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom. -- job 33:33
.
ELIHU ANSWERED (continued his discourse) and said, -- job 34:1
.
Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who have [so much] knowledge. -- job 34:2
.
For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food. -- job 34:3
.
Let us choose for ourselves that which is right; let us know among ourselves what is good. -- job 34:4
.
For Job has said, I am [innocent and uncompromisingly] righteous, but God has taken away my right; -- job 34:5
.
Would I lie against my right? Yet, notwithstanding my right, I am counted a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression. -- job 34:6
.
What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing and scorning like water, -- job 34:7
.
Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity and walks with wicked men? -- job 34:8
.
For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God and consent to Him. -- job 34:9
.
Therefore hear me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God that He should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that He should commit iniquity. -- job 34:10
.
For according to the deeds of a man God will [exactly] proportion his pay, and He will cause every man to find [recompense] according to his ways. -- job 34:11
.
Truly God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice. -- job 34:12
.
Who put [God] in charge over the earth? Or who laid on Him the whole world? -- job 34:13
.
If [God] should set His heart upon him [man] and withdraw His [life-giving] spirit and His breath [from man] to Himself, -- job 34:14
.
All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust. -- job 34:15
.
If now you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words. -- job 34:16
.
Is it possible that an enemy of right should govern? And will you condemn Him Who is just and mighty? -- job 34:17
.
[God] Who says to a king, You are worthless and vile, or to princes and nobles, You are ungodly and evil? -- job 34:18
.
[God] is not partial to princes, nor does He regard the rich more than the poor, for they all are the work of His hands. -- job 34:19
.
In a moment they die; even at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no [human] hand. -- job 34:20
.
For [God's] eyes are upon the ways of a man, and He sees all his steps. -- job 34:21
.
There is no darkness nor thick gloom where the evildoers may hide themselves. -- job 34:22
.
[God] sets before man no appointed time, that he should appear before [Him] in judgment. -- job 34:23
.
He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry [before a jury] and in ways past finding out and sets others in their stead. -- job 34:24
.
Therefore He takes knowledge of their works, and He overturns them in the night, so that they are crushed and destroyed. -- job 34:25
.
God strikes them down as wicked men in the open sight of beholders, -- job 34:26
.
Because they turned aside from Him and would not consider or show regard for any of His ways, -- job 34:27
.
So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, and He heard the cry of the afflicted. -- job 34:28
.
When He gives quietness (peace and security from oppression), who then can condemn? When He hides His face [withdrawing His favor and help], who then can behold Him [and make Him gracious], whether it be a nation or a man by himself?-- -- job 34:29
.
That the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people. -- job 34:30
.
For has anyone said to God, I have borne my chastisement; I will not offend any more; -- job 34:31
.
Teach me what I do not see [in regard to how I have sinned]; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more? -- job 34:32
.
Should [God's] recompense [for your sins] be as you will it, when you refuse to accept it? For you must do the choosing, and not I; therefore say what is your truthful conclusion. -- job 34:33
.
Men of understanding will tell me, indeed, every wise man who hears me [will agree], -- job 34:34
.
That Job speaks without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom and insight. -- job 34:35
.
[Would that Job's afflictions be continued and] he be tried to the end because of his answering like wicked men! -- job 34:36
.
For he adds rebellion [in his unsubmissive, defiant attitude toward God] to his unacknowledged sin; he claps his hands [in open mockery and contempt of God] among us, and he multiplies his words of accusation against God. -- job 34:37
.
ELIHU SPOKE further [to Job] and said, -- job 35:1
.
Do you think this is your right, or are you saying, My righteousness is more than God's, -- job 35:2
.
That you ask, What advantage have you? How am I profited more than if I had sinned? -- job 35:3
.
I will answer you and your companions with you. -- job 35:4
.
Look to the heavens and see; and behold the skies which are higher than you. -- job 35:5
.
If you have sinned, how does that affect God? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what have you done to Him? -- job 35:6
.
If you are righteous, what do you [by that] give God? Or what does He receive from your hand? -- job 35:7
.
Your wickedness touches and affects a man such as you are, and your righteousness is for yourself, one of the human race [but it cannot touch God, Who is above such influence]. -- job 35:8
.
Because of the multitudes of oppressions the people cry out; they cry for help because of the violence of the mighty. -- job 35:9
.
But no one says, Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs of rejoicing in the night, -- job 35:10
.
Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens? -- job 35:11
.
[The people] cry out because of the pride of evil men, but He does not answer. -- job 35:12
.
Surely God will refuse to answer [the cry which is] vanity (vain and empty--instead of abiding trust); neither will the Almighty regard it-- -- job 35:13
.
How much less when [missing His righteous judgment on earth] you say that you do not see Him, that your cause is before Him, and you are waiting for Him! -- job 35:14
.
But now because God has not [speedily] punished in His anger and seems to be unaware of the wrong and oppression [of which a person is guilty], -- job 35:15
.
Job uselessly opens his mouth and multiplies words without knowledge [drawing the worthless conclusion that the righteous have no more advantage than the wicked]. -- job 35:16
.
ELIHU PROCEEDED and said, -- job 36:1
.
Bear with me and wait a little longer, and I will show you, for I have something still to say on God's behalf. -- job 36:2
.
I will bring my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. -- job 36:3
.
For truly my words shall not be false; He Who is perfect in knowledge is with you. -- job 36:4
.
Behold! God is mighty, and yet despises no one nor regards anything as trivial; He is mighty in power of understanding and heart. -- job 36:5
.
He does not prolong the life of the wicked, but gives the needy and afflicted their right. -- job 36:6
.
He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous (the upright in right standing with God); but He sets them forever with kings upon the throne, and they are exalted. -- job 36:7
.
And if they are bound in fetters [of adversity] and held by cords of affliction, -- job 36:8
.
Then He shows to them [the true character of] their deeds and their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly [with presumption and self-sufficiency]. -- job 36:9
.
He also opens their ears to instruction and discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity. -- job 36:10
.
If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness and joy. -- job 36:11
.
But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword [of God's destructive judgments], and they shall die in ignorance of true knowledge. -- job 36:12
.
But the godless and profane in heart heap up anger [at the divine discipline]; they do not cry to Him when He binds them [with cords of affliction]. -- job 36:13
.
They die in youth, and their life perishes among the unclean (those who are sodomites). -- job 36:14
.
He delivers the afflicted in their affliction and opens their ears [to His voice] in adversity. -- job 36:15
.
Indeed, God would have allured you out of the mouth of distress into a broad place where there is no situation of perplexity or privation; and that which would be set on your table would be full of fatness. -- job 36:16
.
But if you [Job] are filled with the judgment of the wicked, judgment and justice will keep hold on you. -- job 36:17
.
For let not wrath entice you into scorning chastisements; and let not the greatness of the ransom [the suffering, if rightly endured] turn you aside. -- job 36:18
.
Will your cry be sufficient to keep you from distress, or will all the force of your strength do it? -- job 36:19
.
Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off from their places; -- job 36:20
.
Take heed, turn not to iniquity, for this [the iniquity of complaining against God] you have chosen rather than [submission in] affliction. -- job 36:21
.
Behold, God exalts and does loftily in His power; who is a ruler or a teacher like Him? -- job 36:22
.
Who has appointed God His way? Or who can say, You have done unrighteousness? -- job 36:23
.
Remember that [by submission] you magnify God's work, of which men have sung. -- job 36:24
.
All men have looked upon God's work; man may behold it afar off. -- job 36:25
.
Behold, God is great, and we know Him not! The number of His years is unsearchable. -- job 36:26
.
For He draws up the drops of water, which distil as rain from His vapor, -- job 36:27
.
Which the skies pour down and drop abundantly upon [the multitudes of] mankind. -- job 36:28
.
Not only that, but can anyone understand the spreadings of the clouds or the thunderings of His pavilion? -- job 36:29
.
Behold, He spreads His lightning against the dark clouds and covers the roots of the sea. -- job 36:30
.
For by [His clouds] God executes judgment upon the peoples; He gives food in abundance. -- job 36:31
.
He covers His hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark. -- job 36:32
.
His thunderings speak [awesomely] concerning Him; the cattle are told of His coming storm. -- job 36:33
.
INDEED, [at His thunderings] my heart also trembles and leaps out of its place. -- job 37:1
.
Hear, oh, hear the roar of His voice and the sound of rumbling that goes out of His mouth! -- job 37:2
.
Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, and His lightning to the ends of the earth. -- job 37:3
.
After it His voice roars; He thunders with the voice of His majesty, and He restrains not [His lightnings against His adversaries] when His voice is heard. -- job 37:4
.
God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend. -- job 37:5
.
For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth; likewise He speaks to the showers and to the downpour of His mighty rains. -- job 37:6
.
God seals up (stops, brings to a standstill by severe weather) the hand of every man [and now under His seal their hands are forced to inactivity], that all men whom He has made may know His doings (His sovereign power and their subjection to it). -- job 37:7
.
Then the beasts go into dens and remain in their lairs. -- job 37:8
.
Out of its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds. -- job 37:9
.
By the breath of God ice is given, and the breadth of the waters is frozen over. -- job 37:10
.
He loads the thick cloud with moisture; He scatters the cloud of His lightning. -- job 37:11
.
And it is turned round about by His guidance, that they may do whatever He commands them upon the face of the habitable earth. -- job 37:12
.
Whether it be for correction or for His earth [generally] or for His mercy and loving-kindness, He causes it to come. -- job 37:13
.
Hear this, O Job; stand still and consider the wondrous works of God. -- job 37:14
.
Do you know how God lays His command upon them and causes the lightning of His [storm] cloud to shine? -- job 37:15
.
Do you know how the clouds are balanced [and poised in the heavens], the wonderful works of Him Who is perfect in knowledge? -- job 37:16
.
[Or] why your garments are hot when He quiets the earth [in sultry summer] with the [oppressive] south wind? -- job 37:17
.
Can you along with Him spread out the sky, [which is] strong as a molten mirror? -- job 37:18
.
Tell us [Job] with what words of man we may address such a Being; we cannot state our case because we are in the dark [in the presence of the unsearchable God]. -- job 37:19
.
So shall it be told Him that I wish to speak? If a man speaks, shall he be swallowed up? -- job 37:20
.
And now men cannot look upon the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them. -- job 37:21
.
Golden brightness and splendor come out of the north; [if men can scarcely look upon it, how much less upon the] terrible splendor and majesty God has upon Himself! -- job 37:22
.
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find Him out; He is excellent in power; and to justice and plenteous righteousness He does no violence [He will disregard no right]. -- job 37:23
.
Men therefore [reverently] fear Him; He regards and respects not any who are wise in heart [in their own understanding and conceit]. -- job 37:24
.
THEN THE Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, -- job 38:1
.
Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? -- job 38:2
.
Gird up now your loins like a man, and I will demand of you, and you declare to Me. -- job 38:3
.
Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Declare to Me, if you have and know understanding. -- job 38:4
.
Who determined the measures of the earth, if you know? Or who stretched the measuring line upon it? -- job 38:5
.
Upon what were the foundations of it fastened, or who laid its cornerstone, -- job 38:6
.
When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? -- job 38:7
.
Or who shut up the sea with doors when it broke forth and issued out of the womb?-- -- job 38:8
.
When I made the clouds the garment of it, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it, -- job 38:9
.
And marked for it My appointed boundary and set bars and doors, -- job 38:10
.
And said, Thus far shall you come and no farther; and here shall your proud waves be stayed? -- job 38:11
.
Have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place, -- job 38:12
.
So that [light] may get hold of the corners of the earth and shake the wickedness [of night] out of it? -- job 38:13
.
It is changed like clay into which a seal is pressed; and things stand out like a many-colored garment. -- job 38:14
.
From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken. -- job 38:15
.
Have you explored the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep? -- job 38:16
.
Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of deep darkness? -- job 38:17
.
Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell Me, if you know it all. -- job 38:18
.
Where is the way where light dwells? And as for darkness, where is its abode, -- job 38:19
.
That you may conduct it to its home, and may know the paths to its house? -- job 38:20
.
You must know, since you were born then! Or because you are so extremely old! -- job 38:21
.
Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, or have you seen the treasuries of the hail, -- job 38:22
.
Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war? -- job 38:23
.
By what way is the light distributed, or the east wind spread over the earth? -- job 38:24
.
Who has prepared a channel for the torrents of rain, or a path for the thunderbolt, -- job 38:25
.
To cause it to rain on the uninhabited land [and] on the desert where no man lives, -- job 38:26
.
To satisfy the waste and desolate ground and to cause the tender grass to spring forth? -- job 38:27
.
Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew? -- job 38:28
.
Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who has given it birth? -- job 38:29
.
The waters are congealed like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. -- job 38:30
.
Can you bind the chains of [the cluster of stars called] Pleiades, or loose the cords of [the constellation] Orion? -- job 38:31
.
Can you lead forth the signs of the zodiac in their season? Or can you guide [the stars of] the Bear with her young? -- job 38:32
.
Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule upon the earth? -- job 38:33
.
Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that an abundance of waters may cover you? -- job 38:34
.
Can you send lightnings, that they may go and say to you, Here we are? -- job 38:35
.
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts [or in the dark clouds]? Or who has given understanding to the mind [or to the meteor]? -- job 38:36
.
Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the [water] bottles of the heavens -- job 38:37
.
When [heat has caused] the dust to run into a mass and the clods to cleave fast together? -- job 38:38
.
Can you [Job] hunt the prey for the lion? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions -- job 38:39
.
When they couch in their dens or lie in wait in their hiding place? -- job 38:40
.
Who provides for the raven its prey when its young ones cry to God and wander about for lack of food? -- job 38:41
.
DO YOU know the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth [their young]? [Or] do you observe when the hinds are giving birth? [Do you attend to all this, Job?] -- job 39:1
.
Can you number the months that they carry their offspring? Or do you know the time when they are delivered, -- job 39:2
.
When they bow themselves, bring forth their young ones, [and] cast out their pains? -- job 39:3
.
Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; they go forth and return not to them. -- job 39:4
.
Who has sent out the wild donkey, giving him his freedom? Or who has loosed the bands of the swift donkey [by which his tame brother is bound--he, the shy, the swift-footed, and the untamable], -- job 39:5
.
Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place? -- job 39:6
.
He scorns the tumult of the city and hears not the shoutings of the taskmaster. -- job 39:7
.
The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches after every green thing. -- job 39:8
.
Will the wild ox be willing to serve you, or remain beside your manger? -- job 39:9
.
Can you bind the wild ox with a harness to the plow in the furrow? Or will he harrow the furrows for you? -- job 39:10
.
Will you trust him because his strength is great, or to him will you leave your labor? -- job 39:11
.
Will you depend upon him to bring home your seed and gather the grain of your threshing floor? [Who, Job, was the author of this strange variance in the disposition of animals so alike in appearance? Was it you?] -- job 39:12
.
The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, [but] are they the pinions and plumage of love? -- job 39:13
.
The ostrich leaves her eggs on the ground and warms them in the dust, -- job 39:14
.
Forgetting that a foot may crush them or that the wild beast may trample them. -- job 39:15
.
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers; her labor is in vain because she has no sense of danger [for her unborn brood], -- job 39:16
.
For God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has He imparted to her understanding. -- job 39:17
.
Yet when she lifts herself up in flight, [so swift is she that] she can laugh to scorn the horse and his rider. -- job 39:18
.
Have you given the horse his might? Have you clothed his neck with quivering and a shaking mane? -- job 39:19
.
Was it you [Job] who made him to leap like a locust? The majesty of his [snorting] nostrils is terrible. -- job 39:20
.
He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons [of armed men]. -- job 39:21
.
He mocks at fear and is not dismayed or terrified; neither does he turn back [in battle] from the sword. -- job 39:22
.
The quiver rattles upon him, as do the glittering spear and the lance [of his rider]. -- job 39:23
.
[He seems in running to] devour the ground with fierceness and rage; neither can he stand still at the sound of the [war] trumpet. -- job 39:24
.
As often as the trumpet sounds he says, Ha, ha! And he smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. -- job 39:25
.
Is it by your wisdom [Job] that the hawk soars and stretches her wings toward the south [as winter approaches]? -- job 39:26
.
Does the eagle mount up at your command and make his nest on  high [inaccessible place]? -- job 39:27
.
On the cliff he dwells and remains securely, upon the point of the rock and the stronghold. -- job 39:28
.
From there he spies out the prey; and his eyes see it afar off. -- job 39:29
.
His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he. -- job 39:30
.
MOREOVER, THE Lord said to Job, -- job 40:1
.
Shall he who would find fault with the Almighty contend with Him? He who disputes with God, let him answer it. -- job 40:2
.
Then Job replied to the Lord: -- job 40:3
.
Behold, I am of small account and vile! What shall I answer You? I lay my hand upon my mouth. -- job 40:4
.
I have spoken once, but I will not reply again--indeed, twice [have I answered], but I will proceed no further. -- job 40:5
.
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, saying, -- job 40:6
.
Gird up your loins now like a man; I will demand of you, and you answer Me. -- job 40:7
.
Will you also annul (set aside and render void) My judgment? Will you condemn Me [your God], that you may [appear] righteous and justified? -- job 40:8
.
Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His? -- job 40:9
.
[Since you question the manner of the Almighty's rule] deck yourself now with the excellency and dignity [of the Supreme Ruler, and yourself undertake the government of the world if you are so wise], and array yourself with honor and majesty. -- job 40:10
.
Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him; -- job 40:11
.
Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low, and tread down the wicked where they stand [if you are so able, Job]. -- job 40:12
.
[Bury and] hide them all in the dust together; [and] shut them up [in the prison house of death]. -- job 40:13
.
[If you can do all this, Job, proving yourself of divine might] then will I [God] praise you also [and acknowledge that] your own right hand can save you. -- job 40:14
.
Behold now the behemoth (the hippopotamus), which I created as I did you; he eats grass like an ox. -- job 40:15
.
See now, his strength is in his loins, and his power is in the sinews of his belly. -- job 40:16
.
He moves his tail like a cedar tree; the tendons of his thighs are twisted together [like a rope]. -- job 40:17
.
His bones are like tubes of bronze; his limbs [or ribs] are like bars of iron. -- job 40:18
.
[The hippopotamus] is the first [in magnitude and power] of the works of God [in animal life]; [only] He Who made him provides him with his [swordlike tusks, or only God Who made him can bring near His sword to master him]. -- job 40:19
.
Surely the mountains bring him food, where all the wild animals play. -- job 40:20
.
He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reeds in the marsh. -- job 40:21
.
The lotus trees cover him with their shade; the willows of the brook compass him about. -- job 40:22
.
Behold, if a river is violent and overflows, he does not tremble; he is confident, though the Jordan [River] swells and rushes against his mouth. -- job 40:23
.
Can any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare? -- job 40:24
.
CAN YOU draw out the leviathan (the crocodile) with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord? -- job 41:1
.
Can you put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook or a spike? -- job 41:2
.
Will he make many supplications to you [begging to be spared]? Will he speak soft words to you [to coax you to treat him kindly]? -- job 41:3
.
Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever? -- job 41:4
.
Will you play with [the crocodile] as with a bird? Or will you put him on a leash for your maidens? -- job 41:5
.
Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants? -- job 41:6
.
Can you fill his skin with harpoons? Or his head with fishing spears? -- job 41:7
.
Lay your hand upon him! Remember your battle with him; you will not do [such an ill-advised thing] again! -- job 41:8
.
Behold, the hope of [his assailant] is disappointed; one is cast down even at the sight of him! -- job 41:9
.
No one is so fierce [and foolhardy] that he dares to stir up [the crocodile]; who then is he who can stand before Me [the beast's Creator, or dares to contend with Me]? -- job 41:10
.
Who has first given to Me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heavens is Mine. [Therefore, who can have a claim against God, God Who made the unmastered crocodile?] -- job 41:11
.
I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame. -- job 41:12
.
Who can strip off [the crocodile's] outer garment? [Who can penetrate his double coat of mail?] Who shall come within his jaws? -- job 41:13
.
Who can open the doors of his [lipless] mouth? His [extended jaws and bare] teeth are terrible round about. -- job 41:14
.
His scales are [the crocodile's] pride, [for his back is made of rows of shields] shut up together [as with] a tight seal; -- job 41:15
.
One is so near to another that no air can come between them. -- job 41:16
.
They are joined one to another; they stick together so that they cannot be separated. -- job 41:17
.
His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the [reddish] eyelids of the dawn. -- job 41:18
.
Out of his mouth go burning torches, [and] sparks of fire leap out. -- job 41:19
.
Out of his nostrils goes forth smoke, as out of a seething pot over a fire of rushes. -- job 41:20
.
His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes forth from his mouth. -- job 41:21
.
In [the crocodile's] neck abides strength, and terror dances before him. -- job 41:22
.
The folds of his flesh cleave together; they are firm upon him, and they cannot shake [when he moves]. -- job 41:23
.
His heart is as firm as a stone, indeed, as solid as a nether millstone. -- job 41:24
.
When [the crocodile] raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; because of terror and the crashing they are beside themselves. -- job 41:25
.
Even if one strikes at him with the sword, it cannot get any hold, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin. -- job 41:26
.
He counts iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood. -- job 41:27
.
The arrow cannot make [the crocodile] flee; slingstones are treated by him as stubble. -- job 41:28
.
Clubs [also] are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rushing and the rattling of the javelin. -- job 41:29
.
His underparts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery; he spreads [grooves like] a threshing sledge upon the mire. -- job 41:30
.
He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a [foaming] pot of ointment. -- job 41:31
.
[His swift darting] makes a shining track behind him; one would think the deep to be hoary [with foam]. -- job 41:32
.
Upon earth there is not [the crocodile's] equal, a creature made without fear and he behaves fearlessly. -- job 41:33
.
He looks all mighty [beasts of prey] in the face [without terror]; he is monarch over all the sons of pride. [And now, Job, who are you who dares not arouse the unmastered crocodile, yet who dares resist Me, the beast's Creator, to My face? Everything under the heavens is Mine; therefore, who can have a claim against God?] -- job 41:34
.
THEN JOB said to the Lord, -- job 42:1
.
I know that You can do all things, and that no thought or purpose of Yours can be restrained or thwarted. -- job 42:2
.
[You said to me] Who is this that darkens and obscures counsel [by words] without knowledge? Therefore [I now see] I have [rashly] uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. -- job 42:3
.
[I had virtually said to You what You have said to me:] Hear, I beseech You, and I will speak; I will demand of You, and You declare to me. -- job 42:4
.
I had heard of You [only] by the hearing of the ear, but now my [spiritual] eye sees You. -- job 42:5
.
Therefore I loathe [my words] and abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes. -- job 42:6
.
After the Lord had spoken the previous words to Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job has. -- job 42:7
.
Now therefore take seven bullocks and seven rams and go to My servant Job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept [his prayer] that I deal not with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job has. -- job 42:8
.
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord commanded them; and the Lord accepted [Job's prayer]. -- job 42:9
.
And the Lord turned the captivity of Job and restored his fortunes, when he prayed for his friends; also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. -- job 42:10
.
Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they sympathized with him and comforted him over all the [distressing] calamities that the Lord had brought upon him. Every man also gave him a piece of money, and every man an earring of gold. -- job 42:11
.
And the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had 14,sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. -- job 42:12
.
He had also seven sons and three daughters. -- job 42:13
.
And he called the name of the first Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. -- job 42:14
.
And in all the land there were no women so fair as the daughters of Job, and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers. -- job 42:15
.
After this, Job lived years, and saw his sons and his sons' sons, even to four generations. -- job 42:16
.
So Job died, an old man and full of days. -- job 42:17
.
BLESSED (HAPPY, fortunate, prosperous, and enviable) is the man who walks and lives not in the counsel of the ungodly [following their advice, their plans and purposes], nor stands [submissive and inactive] in the path where sinners walk, nor sits down [to relax and rest] where the scornful [and the mockers] gather. -- psalms 1:1
.
But his delight and desire are in the law of the Lord, and on His law (the precepts, the instructions, the teachings of God) he habitually meditates (ponders and studies) by day and by night. -- psalms 1:2
.
And he shall be like a tree firmly planted [and tended] by the streams of water, ready to bring forth its fruit in its season; its leaf also shall not fade or wither; and everything he does shall prosper [and come to maturity]. -- psalms 1:3
.
Not so the wicked [those disobedient and living without God are not so]. But they are like the chaff [worthless, dead, without substance] which the wind drives away. -- psalms 1:4
.
Therefore the wicked [those disobedient and living without God] shall not stand [justified] in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous [those who are upright and in right standing with God]. -- psalms 1:5
.
For the Lord knows and is fully acquainted with the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly [those living outside God's will] shall perish (end in ruin and come to nought). -- psalms 1:6
.
WHY DO the nations assemble with commotion [uproar and confusion of voices], and why do the people imagine (meditate upon and devise) an empty scheme? -- psalms 2:1
.
The kings of the earth take their places; the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed One (the Messiah, the Christ). They say, -- psalms 2:2
.
Let us break Their bands [of restraint] asunder and cast Their cords [of control] from us. -- psalms 2:3
.
He Who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord has them in derision [and in supreme contempt He mocks them]. -- psalms 2:4
.
He speaks to them in His deep anger and troubles (terrifies and confounds) them in His displeasure and fury, saying, -- psalms 2:5
.
Yet have I anointed (installed and placed) My King [firmly] on My holy hill of Zion. -- psalms 2:6
.
I will declare the decree of the Lord: He said to Me, You are My Son; this day [I declare] I have begotten You. -- psalms 2:7
.
Ask of Me, and I will give You the nations as Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth as Your possession. -- psalms 2:8
.
You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like potters' ware. -- psalms 2:9
.
Now therefore, O you kings, act wisely; be instructed and warned, O you rulers of the earth. -- psalms 2:10
.

.
Attend to me and answer me; I am restless and distraught in my complaint and must moan -- psalms 55:2

Destroy [their schemes], O Lord, confuse their tongues, for I have seen violence and strife in the city. -- psalms 55:9
.

.
Violence and ruin are within it; fraud and guile do not depart from its streets and marketplaces. -- psalms 55:11
.
For it is not an enemy who reproaches and taunts me--then I might bear it; nor is it one who has hated me who insolently vaunts himself against me--then I might hide from him. -- psalms 55:12

.
[My companion] has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; he has broken and profaned his agreement [of friendship and loyalty]. -- psalms 55:20
.
The words of his mouth were smoother than cream or butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords. -- psalms 55:21
.
Cast your burden on the Lord [releasing the weight of it] and He will sustain you; He will never allow the [consistently] righteous to be moved (made to slip, fall, or fail). -- psalms 55:22
.

.
All day long they twist my words and trouble my affairs; all their thoughts are against me for evil and my hurt. -- psalms 56:5
.
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they watch my steps, even as they have [expectantly] waited for my life. -- psalms 56:6
.

You know my reproach and my shame and my dishonor; my adversaries are all before You [fully known to You]. -- psalms 69:19
.
Insults and reproach have broken my heart; I am full of heaviness and I am distressingly sick. I looked for pity, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none. -- psalms 69:20
.
They gave me also gall [poisonous and bitter] for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar (a soured wine) to drink. -- psalms 69:21
.
Let their own table [with all its abundance and luxury] become a snare to them; and when they are secure in peace [or at their sacrificial feasts, let it become] a trap to them. -- psalms 69:22
.
Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually [from terror, dismay, and feebleness]. -- psalms 69:23
.
Pour out Your indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of Your burning anger catch up with them. -- psalms 69:24
.
Let their habitation and their encampment be a desolation; let no one dwell in their tents. -- psalms 69:25
.
For they pursue and persecute him whom You have smitten, and they gossip about those whom You have wounded, [adding] to their grief and pain. -- psalms 69:26
.
Let one [unforgiven] perverseness and iniquity accumulate upon another for them [in Your book], and let them not come into Your righteousness or be justified and acquitted by You. -- psalms 69:27
.
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living and the book of life and not be enrolled among the [uncompromisingly] righteous (those upright and in right standing with God). -- psalms 69:28
.
But I am poor, sorrowful, and in pain; let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high. -- psalms 69:29
.
I will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify Him with thanksgiving, -- psalms 69:30
.
And it will please the Lord better than an ox or a bullock that has horns and hoofs. -- psalms 69:31
.
The humble shall see it and be glad; you who seek God, inquiring for and requiring Him [as your first need], let your hearts revive and live! -- psalms 69:32
.
For the Lord hears the poor and needy and despises not His prisoners (His miserable and wounded ones). -- psalms 69:33
.
Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them. -- psalms 69:34
.
For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; and [His servants] shall remain and dwell there and have it in their possession; -- psalms 69:35
.
The children of His servants shall inherit it, and those who love His name shall dwell in it. -- psalms 69:36
.
MAKE HASTE, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord! -- psalms 70:1
.
Let them be put to shame and confounded that seek and demand my life; let them be turned backward and brought to confusion and dishonor who desire and delight in my hurt. -- psalms 70:2
.
Let them be turned back and appalled because of their shame and disgrace who say, Aha, aha! -- psalms 70:3
.
May all those who seek, inquire of and for You, and require You [as their vital need] rejoice and be glad in You; and may those who love Your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified! -- psalms 70:4
.
But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my Help and my Deliverer; O Lord, do not tarry! -- psalms 70:5
.
IN YOU, O Lord, do I put my trust and confidently take refuge; let me never be put to shame or confusion! -- psalms 71:1
.
Deliver me in Your righteousness and cause me to escape; bow down Your ear to me and save me! -- psalms 71:2
.
Be to me a rock of refuge in which to dwell, and a sheltering stronghold to which I may continually resort, which You have appointed to save me, for You are my Rock and my Fortress. -- psalms 71:3
.
Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man. -- psalms 71:4
.
For You are my hope; O Lord God, You are my trust from my youth and the source of my confidence. -- psalms 71:5
.
Upon You have I leaned and relied from birth; You are He Who took me from my mother's womb and You have been my benefactor from that day. My praise is continually of You. -- psalms 71:6
.
I am as a wonder and surprise to many, but You are my strong refuge. -- psalms 71:7
.
My mouth shall be filled with Your praise and with Your honor all the day. -- psalms 71:8
.
Cast me not off nor send me away in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent and my powers fail. -- psalms 71:9
.
For my enemies talk against me; those who watch for my life consult together, -- psalms 71:10
.
Saying, God has forsaken him; pursue and persecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him. -- psalms 71:11
.
O God, be not far from me! O my God, make haste to help me! -- psalms 71:12
.
Let them be put to shame and consumed who are adversaries to my life; let them be covered with reproach, scorn, and dishonor who seek and require my hurt. -- psalms 71:13
.
But I will hope continually, and will praise You yet more and more. -- psalms 71:14
.
My mouth shall tell of Your righteous acts and of Your deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is more than I know. -- psalms 71:15
.
I will come in the strength and with the mighty acts of the Lord God; I will mention and praise Your righteousness, even Yours alone. -- psalms 71:16
.
O God, You have taught me from my youth, and hitherto have I declared Your wondrous works. -- psalms 71:17
.
Yes, even when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not, [but keep me alive] until I have declared Your mighty strength to [this] generation, and Your might and power to all that are to come. -- psalms 71:18
.
Your righteousness also, O God, is very high [reaching to the heavens], You Who have done great things; O God, who is like You, or who is Your equal? -- psalms 71:19
.
You Who have shown us [all] troubles great and sore will quicken us again and will bring us up again from the depths of the earth. -- psalms 71:20
.
Increase my greatness (my honor) and turn and comfort me. -- psalms 71:21
.
I will also praise You with the harp, even Your truth and faithfulness, O my God; unto You will I sing praises with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel. -- psalms 71:22
.
My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises to You, and my inner being, which You have redeemed. -- psalms 71:23
.
My tongue also shall talk of Your righteousness all the day long; for they are put to shame, for they are confounded, who seek and demand my hurt. -- psalms 71:24
.
GIVE THE king [knowledge of] Your [way of] judging, O God, and [the spirit of] Your righteousness to the king's son [to control all his actions]. -- psalms 72:1
.
Let him judge and govern Your people with righteousness, and Your poor and afflicted ones with judgment and justice. -- psalms 72:2

.
Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before Him and His enemies shall lick the dust. -- psalms 72:9

The kings of Tarshish and of the coasts shall bring offerings; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. -- psalms 72:10
.

.
There shall be abundance of grain in the soil upon the top of the mountains [the least fruitful places in the land]; the fruit of it shall wave like [the forests of] Lebanon, and [the inhabitants of] the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. -- psalms 72:16
.
His name shall endure forever; His name shall continue as long as the sun [indeed, His name continues before the sun]. And men shall be blessed and bless themselves by Him; all nations shall call Him blessed! -- psalms 72:17

The prayers of David son of Jesse are ended. -- psalms 72:20
.
TRULY GOD is [only] good to Israel, even to those who are upright and pure in heart. -- psalms 73:1
.
But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipped. -- psalms 73:2
.
For I was envious of the foolish and arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. -- psalms 73:3
.
For they suffer no violent pangs in their death, but their strength is firm. -- psalms 73:4
.
They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they smitten and plagued like other men. -- psalms 73:5
.
Therefore pride is about their necks like a chain; violence covers them like a garment [like a long, luxurious robe]. -- psalms 73:6
.
Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than heart could wish; and the imaginations of their minds overflow [with follies]. -- psalms 73:7
.
They scoff, and wickedly utter oppression; they speak loftily [from on high, maliciously and blasphemously]. -- psalms 73:8
.
They set their mouths against and speak down from heaven, and their tongues swagger through the earth [invading even heaven with blasphemy and smearing earth with slanders]. -- psalms 73:9
.
Therefore His people return here, and waters of a full cup [offered by the wicked] are [blindly] drained by them. -- psalms 73:10
.
And they say, How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High? -- psalms 73:11
.
Behold, these are the ungodly, who always prosper and are at ease in the world; they increase in riches. -- psalms 73:12
.
Surely then in vain have I cleansed my heart and washed my hands in innocency. -- psalms 73:13
.
For all the day long have I been smitten and plagued, and chastened every morning. -- psalms 73:14
.
Had I spoken thus [and given expression to my feelings], I would have been untrue and have dealt treacherously against the generation of Your children. -- psalms 73:15
.
But when I considered how to understand this, it was too great an effort for me and too painful -- psalms 73:16
.
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I understood [for I considered] their end. -- psalms 73:17
.
[After all] You do set the [wicked] in slippery places; You cast them down to ruin and destruction. -- psalms 73:18
.
How they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors! -- psalms 73:19
.
As a dream [which seems real] until one awakens, so, O Lord, when You arouse Yourself [to take note of the wicked], You will despise their outward show. -- psalms 73:20
.
For my heart was grieved, embittered, and in a state of ferment, and I was pricked in my heart [as with the sharp fang of an adder]. -- psalms 73:21
.
So foolish, stupid, and brutish was I, and ignorant; I was like a beast before You. -- psalms 73:22
.
Nevertheless I am continually with You; You do hold my right hand. -- psalms 73:23
.
You will guide me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to honor and glory. -- psalms 73:24
.
Whom have I in heaven but You? And I have no delight or desire on earth besides You. -- psalms 73:25
.
My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the Rock and firm Strength of my heart and my Portion forever. -- psalms 73:26
.
For behold, those who are far from You shall perish; You will destroy all who are false to You and like [spiritual] harlots depart from You. -- psalms 73:27
.
But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God and made Him my refuge, that I may tell of all Your works. -- psalms 73:28
.
O GOD, why do You cast us off forever? Why does Your anger burn and smoke against the sheep of Your pasture? -- psalms 74:1
.
[Earnestly] remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your heritage; remember Mount Zion, where You have dwelt. -- psalms 74:2
.
Direct Your feet [quickly] to the perpetual ruins and desolations; the foe has devastated and desecrated everything in the sanctuary. -- psalms 74:3
.
In the midst of Your Holy Place Your enemies have roared [with their battle cry]; they set up their own [idol] emblems for signs [of victory]. -- psalms 74:4
.
They seemed like men who lifted up axes upon a thicket of trees to make themselves a record. -- psalms 74:5
.
And then all the carved wood of the Holy Place they broke down with hatchets and hammers. -- psalms 74:6
.
They have set Your sanctuary on fire; they have profaned the dwelling place of Your Name by casting it to the ground. -- psalms 74:7
.
They said in their hearts, Let us make havoc [of such places] altogether. They have burned up all God's meetinghouses in the land. -- psalms 74:8
.
We do not see our symbols; there is no longer any prophet, neither does any among us know for how long. -- psalms 74:9
.
O God, how long is the adversary to scoff and reproach? Is the enemy to blaspheme and revile Your name forever? -- psalms 74:10
.
Why do You hold back Your hand, even Your right hand? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them [make an end of them]! -- psalms 74:11
.
Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. -- psalms 74:12
.
You did divide the [Red] Sea by Your might; You broke the heads of the [Egyptian] dragons in the waters. -- psalms 74:13
.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan (Egypt); You did give him as food for the creatures inhabiting the wilderness. -- psalms 74:14
.
You did cleave open [the rock bringing forth] fountains and streams; You dried up mighty, ever-flowing rivers (the Jordan). -- psalms 74:15
.
The day is Yours, the night also is Yours; You have established the [starry] light and the sun. -- psalms 74:16
.
You have fixed all the borders of the earth [the divisions of land and sea and of the nations]; You have made summer and winter. [Acts17:26.] -- psalms 74:17
.
[Earnestly] remember how the enemy has scoffed, O Lord, and reproached You, and how a foolish and impious people has blasphemed Your name. -- psalms 74:18
.
Oh, do not deliver the life of your turtledove to the wild beast (to the greedy multitude); forget not the life [of the multitude] of Your poor forever. -- psalms 74:19
.
Have regard for the covenant [You made with Abraham], for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. -- psalms 74:20
.
Oh, let not the downtrodden return in shame; let the oppressed and needy praise Your name. -- psalms 74:21
.
Arise, O God, plead Your own cause; remember [earnestly] how the foolish and impious man scoffs and reproaches You day after day and all day long. -- psalms 74:22
.
Do not forget the [clamoring] voices of Your adversaries, the tumult of those who rise up against You, which ascends continually. -- psalms 74:23
.
WE GIVE praise and thanks to You, O God, we praise and give thanks; Your wondrous works declare that Your Name is near and they who invoke Your Name rehearse Your wonders. -- psalms 75:1
.
When the proper time has come [for executing My judgments], I will judge uprightly [says the Lord]. -- psalms 75:2
.
When the earth totters, and all the inhabitants of it, it is I Who will poise and keep steady its pillars. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 75:3
.
I said to the arrogant and boastful, Deal not arrogantly [do not boast]; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn [of personal aggrandizement]. -- psalms 75:4
.
Lift not up your [aggressive] horn on high, speak not with a stiff neck and insolent arrogance. -- psalms 75:5
.
For not from the east nor from the west nor from the south come promotion and lifting up. -- psalms 75:6
.
But God is the Judge! He puts down one and lifts up another. -- psalms 75:7
.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup [of His wrath], and the wine foams and is red, well mixed; and He pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth must drain it and drink its dregs. -- psalms 75:8
.
But I will declare and rejoice forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. -- psalms 75:9
.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I cut off [says the Lord], but the horns of the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall be exalted. -- psalms 75:10
.
IN JUDAH God is known and renowned; His name is highly praised and is great in Israel. -- psalms 76:1
.
In [Jeru]Salem also is His tabernacle, and His dwelling place is in Zion. -- psalms 76:2
.
There He broke the bow's flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 76:3
.
Glorious and excellent are You from the mountains of prey [splendid and majestic, more than the everlasting mountains]. -- psalms 76:4
.
The stouthearted are stripped of their spoil, they have slept the sleep [of death]; and none of the men of might could raise their hands. -- psalms 76:5
.
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both chariot [rider] and horse are cast into a dead sleep [of death]. -- psalms 76:6
.
You, even You, are to be feared [with awe and reverence]! Who may stand in Your presence when once Your anger is roused? -- psalms 76:7
.
You caused sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared and was still-- -- psalms 76:8
.
When God arose to [establish] judgment, to save all the meek and oppressed of the earth. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 76:9
.
Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; the remainder of wrath shall You restrain and gird and arm Yourself with it. -- psalms 76:10
.
Vow and pay to the Lord your God; let all who are round about Him bring presents to Him Who ought to be [reverently] feared. -- psalms 76:11
.
He will cut off the spirit [of pride and fury] of princes; He is terrible to the [ungodly] kings of the earth. -- psalms 76:12
.
I WILL cry to God with my voice, even to God with my voice, and He will give ear and hearken to me. -- psalms 77:1
.
In the day of my trouble I seek (inquire of and desperately require) the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out [in prayer] without slacking up; I refuse to be comforted. -- psalms 77:2
.
I [earnestly] remember God; I am disquieted and I groan; I muse in prayer, and my spirit faints [overwhelmed]. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 77:3
.
You hold my eyes from closing; I am so troubled that I cannot speak. -- psalms 77:4
.
I consider the days of old, the years of bygone times [of prosperity]. -- psalms 77:5
.
I call to remembrance my song in the night; with my heart I meditate and my spirit searches diligently: -- psalms 77:6
.
Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more? -- psalms 77:7
.
Have His mercy and loving-kindness ceased forever? Have His promises ended for all time? -- psalms 77:8
.
Has God [deliberately] abandoned or forgotten His graciousness? Has He in anger shut up His compassion? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 77:9
.
And I say, This [apparent desertion of Israel by God] is my appointed lot and trial, but I will recall the years of the right hand of the Most High [in loving-kindness extended toward us], for this is my grief, that the right hand of the Most High changes. -- psalms 77:10
.
I will [earnestly] recall the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will [earnestly] remember the wonders [You performed for our fathers] of old. -- psalms 77:11
.
I will meditate also upon all Your works and consider all Your [mighty] deeds. -- psalms 77:12
.
Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary [in holiness, away from sin and guilt]. Who is a great God like our God? -- psalms 77:13
.
You are the God Who does wonders; You have demonstrated Your power among the peoples. -- psalms 77:14
.
You have with Your [mighty] arm redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 77:15
.
When the waters [at the Red Sea and the Jordan] saw You, O God, they were afraid; the deep shuddered also, for [all] the waters saw You. -- psalms 77:16
.
The clouds poured down water, the skies sent out a sound [of rumbling thunder]; Your arrows went forth [in forked lightning]. -- psalms 77:17
.
The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind, the lightnings illumined the world; the earth trembled and shook. -- psalms 77:18
.
Your way [in delivering Your people] was through the sea, and Your paths through the great waters, yet Your footsteps were not traceable, but were obliterated. -- psalms 77:19
.
You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. -- psalms 77:20
.
GIVE EAR, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth. -- psalms 78:1
.
I will open my mouth in a parable (in instruction by numerous examples); I will utter dark sayings of old [that hide important truth]-- -- psalms 78:2
.
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. -- psalms 78:3
.
We will not hide them from their children, but we will tell to the generation to come the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, and His might, and the wonderful works that He has performed. -- psalms 78:4
.
For He established a testimony (an express precept) in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, commanding our fathers that they should make [the great facts of God's dealings with Israel] known to their children, -- psalms 78:5
.
That the generation to come might know them, that the children still to be born might arise and recount them to their children, -- psalms 78:6
.
That they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but might keep His commandments -- psalms 78:7
.
And might not be as their fathers--a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that set not their hearts aright nor prepared their hearts to know God, and whose spirits were not steadfast and faithful to God. -- psalms 78:8
.
The children of Ephraim were armed and carrying bows, yet they turned back in the day of battle. -- psalms 78:9
.
They kept not the covenant of God and refused to walk according to His law -- psalms 78:10
.
And forgot His works and His wonders that He had shown them. -- psalms 78:11
.
Marvelous things did He in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan [where Pharaoh resided]. -- psalms 78:12
.
He divided the [Red] Sea and caused them to pass through it, and He made the waters stand like a heap. -- psalms 78:13
.
In the daytime also He led them with a [pillar of] cloud and all the night with a light of fire. -- psalms 78:14
.
He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as out of the deep. -- psalms 78:15
.
He brought streams also out of the rock [at Rephidim and Kadesh] and caused waters to run down like rivers. -- psalms 78:16
.
Yet they still went on to sin against Him by provoking and rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness (in the land of drought). -- psalms 78:17
.
And they tempted God in their hearts by asking for food according to their [selfish] desire and appetite. -- psalms 78:18
.
Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish [the food for] a table in the wilderness? -- psalms 78:19
.
Behold, He did smite the rock so that waters gushed out and the streams overflowed; but can He give bread also? Can He provide flesh for His people? -- psalms 78:20
.
Therefore, when the Lord heard, He was [full of] wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob, His anger mounted up against Israel, -- psalms 78:21
.
Because in God they believed not [they relied not on Him, they adhered not to Him], and they trusted not in His salvation (His power to save). -- psalms 78:22
.
Yet He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven; -- psalms 78:23
.
And He rained down upon them manna to eat and gave them heaven's grain. -- psalms 78:24
.
Everyone ate the bread of the mighty [man ate angels' food]; God sent them meat in abundance. -- psalms 78:25
.
He let forth the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by His power He guided the south wind. -- psalms 78:26
.
He rained flesh also upon them like the dust, and winged birds [quails] like the sand of the seas. -- psalms 78:27
.
And He let [the birds] fall in the midst of their camp, round about their tents. -- psalms 78:28
.
So they ate and were well filled; He gave them what they craved and lusted after. -- psalms 78:29
.
But scarce had they stilled their craving, and while their meat was yet in their mouths, -- psalms 78:30
.
The wrath of God came upon them and slew the strongest and sturdiest of them and smote down Israel's chosen youth. -- psalms 78:31
.
In spite of all this, they sinned still more, for they believed not in (relied not on and adhered not to Him for) His wondrous works. -- psalms 78:32
.
Therefore their days He consumed like a breath [in emptiness, falsity, and futility] and their years in terror and sudden haste. -- psalms 78:33
.
When He slew [some of] them, [the remainder] inquired after Him diligently, and they repented and sincerely sought God [for a time]. -- psalms 78:34
.
And they [earnestly] remembered that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their Redeemer. -- psalms 78:35
.
Nevertheless they flattered Him with their mouths and lied to Him with their tongues. -- psalms 78:36
.
For their hearts were not right or sincere with Him, neither were they faithful and steadfast to His covenant. -- psalms 78:37
.
But He, full of [merciful] compassion, forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not; yes, many a time He turned His anger away and did not stir up all His wrath and indignation. -- psalms 78:38
.
For He [earnestly] remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that goes and does not return. -- psalms 78:39
.
How often they defied and rebelled against Him in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert! -- psalms 78:40
.
And time and again they turned back and tempted God, provoking and incensing the Holy One of Israel. -- psalms 78:41
.
They remembered not [seriously the miracles of the working of] His hand, nor the day when He delivered them from the enemy, -- psalms 78:42
.
How He wrought His miracles in Egypt and His wonders in the field of Zoan [where Pharaoh resided] -- psalms 78:43
.
And turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink from them. -- psalms 78:44
.
He sent swarms of [venomous] flies among them which devoured them, and frogs which destroyed them. -- psalms 78:45
.
He gave also their crops to the caterpillar and [the fruit of] their labor to the locust. -- psalms 78:46
.
He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with frost and [great chunks of] ice. -- psalms 78:47
.
He [caused them to shut up their cattle or] gave them up also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. -- psalms 78:48
.
He let loose upon them the fierceness of His anger, His wrath and indignation and distress, by sending [a mission of] angels of calamity and woe among them. -- psalms 78:49
.
He leveled and made a straight path for His anger [to give it free course]; He did not spare [the Egyptian families] from death but gave their beasts over to the pestilence and the life [of their eldest] over to the plague. -- psalms 78:50
.
He smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents [of the land of the sons] of Ham. -- psalms 78:51
.
But [God] led His own people forth like sheep and guided them [with a shepherd's care] like a flock in the wilderness. -- psalms 78:52
.
And He led them on safely and in confident trust, so that they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. -- psalms 78:53
.
And He brought them to His holy border, the border of [Canaan] His sanctuary, even to this mountain [Zion] which His right hand had acquired. -- psalms 78:54
.
He drove out the nations also before [Israel] and allotted their land as a heritage, measured out and partitioned; and He made the tribes of Israel to dwell in the tents of those dispossessed. -- psalms 78:55
.
Yet they tempted and provoked and rebelled against the Most High God and kept not His testimonies. -- psalms 78:56
.
But they turned back and dealt unfaithfully and treacherously like their fathers; they were twisted like a warped and deceitful bow [that will not respond to the archer's aim]. -- psalms 78:57
.
For they provoked Him to [righteous] anger with their high places [for idol worship] and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images. -- psalms 78:58
.
When God heard this, He was full of [holy] wrath; and He utterly rejected Israel, greatly abhorring and loathing [her ways], -- psalms 78:59
.
So that He forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent in which He had dwelt among men [and never returned to it again], -- psalms 78:60
.
And delivered His strength and power (the ark of the covenant) into captivity, and His glory into the hands of the foe (the Philistines). -- psalms 78:61
.
He gave His people over also to the sword and was wroth with His heritage [Israel]. -- psalms 78:62
.
The fire [of war] devoured their young men, and their bereaved virgins were not praised in a wedding song. -- psalms 78:63
.
Their priests [Hophni and Phinehas] fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation [for the bodies came not back from the scene of battle, and the widow of Phinehas also died that day]. -- psalms 78:64
.
Then the Lord awakened as from sleep, as a strong man whose consciousness of power is heightened by wine. -- psalms 78:65
.
And He smote His adversaries in the back [as they fled]; He put them to lasting shame and reproach. -- psalms 78:66
.
Moreover, He rejected the tent of Joseph and chose not the tribe of Ephraim [in which the tabernacle had been accustomed to stand]. -- psalms 78:67
.
But He chose the tribe of Judah [as Israel's leader], Mount Zion, which He loved [to replace Shiloh as His capital]. -- psalms 78:68
.
And He built His sanctuary [exalted] like the heights [of the heavens] and like the earth which He established forever. -- psalms 78:69
.
He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds; -- psalms 78:70
.
From tending the ewes that had their young He brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob His people, of Israel His inheritance. -- psalms 78:71
.
So [David] was their shepherd with an upright heart; he guided them by the discernment and skillfulness [which controlled] his hands. -- psalms 78:72
.
O GOD, the nations have come into [the land of Your people] Your inheritance; Your sacred temple have they defiled; they have made Jerusalem heaps of ruins. -- psalms 79:1
.
The dead bodies of Your servants they have given as food to the birds of the heavens, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth. -- psalms 79:2
.
Their blood they have poured out like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them. -- psalms 79:3
.
[Because of such humiliation] we have become a taunt and reproach to our neighbors, a mocking and derision to those who are round about us. -- psalms 79:4
.
How long, O Lord? Will You be angry forever? Shall Your jealousy [which cannot endure a divided allegiance] burn like fire? -- psalms 79:5
.
Pour out Your wrath on the Gentile nations who do not acknowledge You, and upon the kingdoms that do not call on Your name. -- psalms 79:6
.
For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his dwelling and his pasture. -- psalms 79:7
.
O do not [earnestly] remember against us the iniquities and guilt of our forefathers! Let Your compassion and tender mercy speedily come to meet us, for we are brought very low. -- psalms 79:8
.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name! Deliver us, forgive us, and purge away our sins for Your name's sake. -- psalms 79:9
.
Why should the Gentile nations say, Where is their God? Let vengeance for the blood of Your servants which is poured out be known among the nations in our sight [not delaying until some future generation]. -- psalms 79:10
.
Let the groaning and sighing of the prisoner come before You; according to the greatness of Your power and Your arm spare those who are appointed to die! -- psalms 79:11
.
And return into the bosom of our neighbors sevenfold the taunts with which they have taunted and scoffed at You, O Lord! -- psalms 79:12
.
Then we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will give You thanks forever; we will show forth and publish Your praise from generation to generation. -- psalms 79:13
.
GIVE EAR, O Shepherd of Israel, You Who lead Joseph like a flock; You Who sit enthroned upon the cherubim [of the ark of the covenant], shine forth -- psalms 80:1
.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh! Stir up Your might, and come to save us! -- psalms 80:2
.
Restore us again, O God; and cause Your face to shine [in pleasure and approval on us], and we shall be saved! -- psalms 80:3
.
O Lord God of hosts, how long will You be angry with Your people's prayers? -- psalms 80:4
.
You have fed them with the bread of tears, and You have given them tears to drink in large measure. -- psalms 80:5
.
You make us a strife and scorn to our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves. -- psalms 80:6
.
Restore us again, O God of hosts; and cause Your face to shine [upon us with favor as of old], and we shall be saved! -- psalms 80:7
.
You brought a vine [Israel] out of Egypt; You drove out the [heathen] nations and planted it [in Canaan]. -- psalms 80:8
.
You prepared room before it, and it took deep root and it filled the land. -- psalms 80:9
.
The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs of it were like the great cedars [cedars of God]. -- psalms 80:10
.
[Israel] sent out its boughs to the [Mediterranean] Sea and its branches to the [Euphrates] River. -- psalms 80:11
.
Why have You broken down its hedges and walls so that all who pass by pluck from its fruit? -- psalms 80:12
.
The boar out of the wood wastes it and the wild beast of the field feeds on it. -- psalms 80:13
.
Turn again, we beseech You, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven and see, visit, and have regard for this vine! -- psalms 80:14
.
[Protect and maintain] the stock which Your right hand planted, and the branch (the son) that You have reared and made strong for Yourself. -- psalms 80:15
.
They have burned it with fire, it is cut down; may they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance. -- psalms 80:16
.
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, upon the son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself. -- psalms 80:17
.
Then will we not depart from You; revive us (give us life) and we will call upon Your name. -- psalms 80:18
.
Restore us, O Lord God of hosts; cause Your face to shine [in pleasure, approval, and favor on us], and we shall be saved! -- psalms 80:19
.
SING ALOUD to God our Strength! Shout for joy to the God of Jacob! -- psalms 81:1
.
Raise a song, sound the timbrel, the sweet lyre with the harp. -- psalms 81:2
.
Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day. -- psalms 81:3
.
For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. -- psalms 81:4
.
This He ordained in Joseph [the savior] for a testimony when He went out over the land of Egypt. The speech of One Whom I knew not did I hear [saying], -- psalms 81:5
.
I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the basket. -- psalms 81:6
.
You called in distress and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 81:7
.
Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you--O Israel, if you would listen to Me! -- psalms 81:8
.
There shall no strange god be among you, neither shall you worship any alien god. -- psalms 81:9
.
I am the Lord your God, Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it. -- psalms 81:10
.
But My people would not hearken to My voice, and Israel would have none of Me. -- psalms 81:11
.
So I gave them up to their own hearts' lust and let them go after their own stubborn will, that they might follow their own counsels. -- psalms 81:12
.
Oh, that My people would listen to Me, that Israel would walk in My ways! -- psalms 81:13
.
Speedily then I would subdue their enemies and turn My hand against their adversaries. -- psalms 81:14
.
[Had Israel listened to Me in Egypt, then] those who hated the Lord would have come cringing before Him, and their defeat would have lasted forever. -- psalms 81:15
.
[God] would feed [Israel now] also with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the rock would I satisfy you. -- psalms 81:16
.
GOD STANDS in the assembly [of the representatives] of God; in the midst of the magistrates or judges He gives judgment [as] among the gods. -- psalms 82:1
.
How long will you [magistrates or judges] judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 82:2
.
Do justice to the weak (poor) and fatherless; maintain the rights of the afflicted and needy. -- psalms 82:3
.
Deliver the poor and needy; rescue them out of the hand of the wicked. -- psalms 82:4
.
[The magistrates and judges] know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in the darkness [of complacent satisfaction]; all the foundations of the earth [the fundamental principles upon which rests the administration of justice] are shaking. -- psalms 82:5
.
I said, You are gods [since you judge on My behalf, as My representatives]; indeed, all of you are children of the Most High. -- psalms 82:6
.
But you shall die as men and fall as one of the princes. -- psalms 82:7
.
Arise, O God, judge the earth! For to You belong all the nations. -- psalms 82:8
.
KEEP NOT silence, O God; hold not Your peace or be still, O God. -- psalms 83:1
.
For, behold, Your enemies are in tumult, and those who hate You have raised their heads. -- psalms 83:2
.
They lay crafty schemes against Your people and consult together against Your hidden and precious ones. -- psalms 83:3
.
They have said, Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be in remembrance no more. -- psalms 83:4
.
For they have consulted together with one accord and one heart; against You they make a covenant-- -- psalms 83:5
.
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites, -- psalms 83:6
.
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre. -- psalms 83:7
.
Assyria also has joined with them; they have helped the children of Lot [the Ammonites and the Moabites] and have been an arm to them. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 83:8
.
Do to them as [You did to] the Midianites, as to Sisera and Jabin at the brook of Kishon, -- psalms 83:9
.
Who perished at Endor, who became like manure for the earth. -- psalms 83:10
.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, yes, all their princes as Zebah and Zalmunna, -- psalms 83:11
.
Who say, Let us take possession for ourselves of the pastures of God. -- psalms 83:12
.
O my God, make them like whirling dust, like stubble or chaff before the wind! -- psalms 83:13
.
As fire consumes the forest, and as the flame sets the mountains ablaze, -- psalms 83:14
.
So pursue and afflict them with Your tempest and terrify them with Your tornado or hurricane. -- psalms 83:15
.
Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek, inquire for, and insistently require Your name, O Lord. -- psalms 83:16
.
Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; yes, let them be put to shame and perish, -- psalms 83:17
.
That they may know that You, Whose name alone is the Lord, are the Most High over all the earth. -- psalms 83:18
.
HOW LOVELY are Your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! -- psalms 84:1
.
My soul yearns, yes, even pines and is homesick for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out and sing for joy to the living God. -- psalms 84:2
.
Yes, the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young--even Your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. -- psalms 84:3
.
Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are those who dwell in Your house and Your presence; they will be singing Your praises all the day long. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 84:4
.
Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the man whose strength is in You, in whose heart are the highways to Zion. -- psalms 84:5
.
Passing through the Valley of Weeping (Baca), they make it a place of springs; the early rain also fills [the pools] with blessings. -- psalms 84:6
.
They go from strength to strength [increasing in victorious power]; each of them appears before God in Zion. -- psalms 84:7
.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 84:8
.
Behold our shield [the king as Your agent], O God, and look upon the face of Your anointed! -- psalms 84:9
.
For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand [anywhere else]; I would rather be a doorkeeper and stand at the threshold in the house of my God than to dwell [at ease] in the tents of wickedness. -- psalms 84:10
.
For the Lord God is a Sun and Shield; the Lord bestows [present] grace and favor and [future] glory (honor, splendor, and heavenly bliss)! No good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly. -- psalms 84:11
.
O Lord of hosts, blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the man who trusts in You [leaning and believing on You, committing all and confidently looking to You, and that without fear or misgiving]! -- psalms 84:12
.
LORD, YOU have [at last] been favorable and have dealt graciously with Your land [of Canaan]; You have brought back [from Babylon] the captives of Jacob. -- psalms 85:1
.
You have forgiven and taken away the iniquity of Your people, You have covered all their sin. Selah [pause, and calmly realize what that means]! -- psalms 85:2
.
You have withdrawn all Your wrath and indignation, You have turned away from the blazing anger [which You had let loose]. -- psalms 85:3
.
Restore us, O God of our salvation, and cause Your anger toward us to cease [forever]. -- psalms 85:4
.
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger [and disfavor] and spread it out to all generations? -- psalms 85:5
.
Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You? -- psalms 85:6
.
Show us Your mercy and loving-kindness, O Lord, and grant us Your salvation. -- psalms 85:7
.
I will listen [with expectancy] to what God the Lord will say, for He will speak peace to His people, to His saints (those who are in right standing with Him)--but let them not turn again to [self-confident] folly. -- psalms 85:8
.
Surely His salvation is near to those who reverently and worshipfully fear Him, [and is ready to be appropriated] that [the manifest presence of God, His] glory may tabernacle and abide in our land. -- psalms 85:9
.
Mercy and loving-kindness and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. -- psalms 85:10
.
Truth shall spring up from the earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven. -- psalms 85:11
.
Yes, the Lord will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase. -- psalms 85:12
.
Righteousness shall go before Him and shall make His footsteps a way in which to walk. -- psalms 85:13
.
INCLINE YOUR ear, O Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and distressed, needy and desiring. -- psalms 86:1
.
Preserve my life, for I am godly and dedicated; O my God, save Your servant, for I trust in You [leaning and believing on You, committing all and confidently looking to You, without fear or doubt]. -- psalms 86:2
.
Be merciful and gracious to me, O Lord, for to You do I cry all the day. -- psalms 86:3
.
Make me, Your servant, to rejoice, O Lord, for to You do I lift myself up. -- psalms 86:4
.
For You, O Lord, are good, and ready to forgive [our trespasses, sending them away, letting them go completely and forever]; and You are abundant in mercy and loving-kindness to all those who call upon You. -- psalms 86:5
.
Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and listen to the cry of my supplications. -- psalms 86:6
.
In the day of my trouble I will call on You, for You will answer me. -- psalms 86:7
.
There is none like unto You among the gods, O Lord, neither are their works like unto Yours. -- psalms 86:8
.
All nations whom You have made shall come and fall down before You, O Lord; and they shall glorify Your name. -- psalms 86:9
.
For You are great and work wonders! You alone are God. -- psalms 86:10
.
Teach me Your way, O Lord, that I may walk and live in Your truth; direct and unite my heart [solely, reverently] to fear and honor Your name. -- psalms 86:11
.
I will confess and praise You, O Lord my God, with my whole (united) heart; and I will glorify Your name forevermore. -- psalms 86:12
.
For great is Your mercy and loving-kindness toward me; and You have delivered me from the depths of Sheol [from the exceeding depths of affliction]. -- psalms 86:13
.
O God, the proud and insolent are risen against me; a rabble of violent and ruthless men has sought and demanded my life, and they have not set You before them. -- psalms 86:14
.
But You, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in mercy and loving-kindness and truth. -- psalms 86:15
.
O turn to me and have mercy and be gracious to me; grant strength (might and inflexibility to temptation) to Your servant and save the son of Your handmaiden. -- psalms 86:16
.
Show me a sign of [Your evident] goodwill and favor, that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame, because You, Lord, [will show Your approval of me when You] help and comfort me. -- psalms 86:17
.
ON THE holy hills stands the city [of Jerusalem and the temple] God founded. -- psalms 87:1
.
The Lord loves the gates of Zion [through which the crowds of pilgrims enter from all nations] more than all the dwellings of Jacob (Israel). -- psalms 87:2
.
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah [pause, and calmly realize what that means]! -- psalms 87:3
.
I will make mention of Rahab [the poetic name for Egypt] and Babylon as among those who know [the city of God]--behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia (Cush)--[saying], This man was born there. -- psalms 87:4
.
Yes, of Zion it shall be said, This man and that man were born in her, for the Most High Himself will establish her. -- psalms 87:5
.
The Lord shall count, when He registers the peoples, that this man was born there. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 87:6

The singers as well as the players on instruments shall say, All my springs (my sources of life and joy) are in you [city of our God]. -- psalms 87:7

O LORD, the God of my salvation, I have cried to You for help by day; at night I am in Your presence. -- psalms 88:1
.
Let my prayer come before You and really enter into Your presence; incline Your ear to my cry! -- psalms 88:2
.
For I am full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol (the place of the dead). -- psalms 88:3
.
I am counted among those who go down into the pit (the grave); I am like a man who has no help or strength [a mere shadow], -- psalms 88:4
.
Cast away among the dead, like the slain that lie in a [nameless] grave, whom You [seriously] remember no more, and they are cut off from Your hand. -- psalms 88:5
.
You have laid me in the depths of the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. -- psalms 88:6
.
Your wrath lies hard upon me, and You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 88:7
.
You have put my [familiar] friends far from me; You have made me an abomination to them. I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. -- psalms 88:8
.
My eye grows dim because of sorrow and affliction. Lord, I have called daily on You; I have spread forth my hands to You. -- psalms 88:9
.
Will You show wonders to the dead? Shall the departed arise and praise You? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 88:10
.
Shall Your steadfast love be declared in the grave? Or Your faithfulness in Abaddon (Sheol, as a place of ruin and destruction)? -- psalms 88:11
.
Shall Your wonders be known in the dark? And Your righteousness in the place of forgetfulness [where the dead forget and are forgotten]? -- psalms 88:12
.
But to You I cry, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer come to meet You. -- psalms 88:13
.
Lord, why do You cast me off? Why do You hide Your face from me? -- psalms 88:14
.
I was afflicted and close to death from my youth up; while I suffer Your terrors I am distracted [I faint]. -- psalms 88:15
.
Your fierce wrath has swept over me; Your terrors have destroyed me. -- psalms 88:16
.
They surround me like a flood all day long; together they have closed in upon me. -- psalms 88:17
.
Lover and friend have You put far from me; my familiar friends are darkness and the grave. -- psalms 88:18
.
I WILL sing of the mercy and loving-kindness of the Lord forever; with my mouth will I make known Your faithfulness from generation to generation. -- psalms 89:1
.
For I have said, Mercy and loving-kindness shall be built up forever; Your faithfulness will You establish in the very heavens [unchangeable and perpetual]. -- psalms 89:2
.
[You have said] I have made a covenant with My chosen one, I have sworn to David My servant, -- psalms 89:3
.
Your Seed I will establish forever, and I will build up your throne for all generations. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! -- psalms 89:4
.
Let heaven (the angels) praise Your wonders, O Lord, Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones (the holy angels). -- psalms 89:5
.
For who in the heavens can be compared to the Lord? Who among the mighty [heavenly beings] can be likened to the Lord, -- psalms 89:6
.
A God greatly feared and revered in the council of the holy (angelic) ones, and to be feared and worshipfully revered above all those who are round about Him? -- psalms 89:7
.
O Lord God of hosts, who is a mighty one like unto You, O Lord? And Your faithfulness is round about You [an essential part of You at all times]. -- psalms 89:8
.
You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves arise, You still them. -- psalms 89:9
.
You have broken Rahab (Egypt) in pieces; with Your mighty arm You have scattered Your enemies. -- psalms 89:10
.
The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours; the world and all that is in it, You have founded them. -- psalms 89:11
.
The north and the south, You have created them; Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon joyously praise Your name. -- psalms 89:12
.
You have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand, Your right hand is soaring high. -- psalms 89:13
.
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and loving-kindness and truth go before Your face. -- psalms 89:14
.
Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are the people who know the joyful sound [who understand and appreciate the spiritual blessings symbolized by the feasts]; they walk, O Lord, in the light and favor of Your countenance! -- psalms 89:15
.
In Your name they rejoice all the day, and in Your righteousness they are exalted. -- psalms 89:16
.
For You are the glory of their strength [their proud adornment], and by Your favor our horn is exalted and we walk with uplifted faces! -- psalms 89:17
.
For our shield belongs to the Lord, and our king to the Holy One of Israel. -- psalms 89:18
.
Once You spoke in a vision to Your devoted ones and said, I have endowed one who is mighty [a hero, giving him the power to help--to be a champion for Israel]; I have exalted one chosen from among the people. -- psalms 89:19
.
I have found David My servant; with My holy oil have I anointed him, -- psalms 89:20
.
With whom My hand shall be established and ever abide; My arm also shall strengthen him. -- psalms 89:21
.
The enemy shall not exact from him or do him violence or outwit him, nor shall the wicked afflict and humble him. -- psalms 89:22
.
I will beat down his foes before his face and smite those who hate him. -- psalms 89:23
.
My faithfulness and My mercy and loving-kindness shall be with him, and in My name shall his horn be exalted [great power and prosperity shall be conferred upon him]. -- psalms 89:24
.
I will set his hand in control also on the [Mediterranean] Sea, and his right hand on the rivers [Euphrates with its tributaries]. -- psalms 89:25
.
He shall cry to Me, You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation! -- psalms 89:26
.
Also I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. -- psalms 89:27
.
My mercy and loving-kindness will I keep for him forevermore, and My covenant shall stand fast and be faithful with him. -- psalms 89:28
.
His Offspring also will I make to endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven. -- psalms 89:29
.
If his children forsake My law and walk not in My ordinances, -- psalms 89:30
.
If they break or profane My statutes and keep not My commandments, -- psalms 89:31
.
Then will I punish their transgression with the rod [of chastisement], and their iniquity with stripes. -- psalms 89:32
.
Nevertheless, My loving-kindness will I not break off from him, nor allow My faithfulness to fail [to lie and be false to him]. -- psalms 89:33
.
My covenant will I not break or profane, nor alter the thing that is gone out of My lips. -- psalms 89:34
.
Once [for all] have I sworn by My holiness, which cannot be violated; I will not lie to David: -- psalms 89:35
.
His Offspring shall endure forever, and his throne [shall continue] as the sun before Me. -- psalms 89:36
.

A capable, intelligent, and virtuous woman--who is he who can find her? She is far more precious than jewels and her value is far above rubies or pearls. -- proverbs 31:10
.
The heart of her husband trusts in her confidently and relies on and believes in her securely, so that he has no lack of [honest] gain or need of [dishonest] spoil. -- proverbs 31:11
.
She comforts, encourages, and does him only good as long as there is life within her. -- proverbs 31:12
.
She seeks out wool and flax and works with willing hands [to develop it]. -- proverbs 31:13
.
She is like the merchant ships loaded with foodstuffs; she brings her household's food from a far [country]. -- proverbs 31:14
.
She rises while it is yet night and gets [spiritual] food for her household and assigns her maids their tasks. -- proverbs 31:15
.
She considers a [new] field before she buys or accepts it [expanding prudently and not courting neglect of her present duties by assuming other duties]; with her savings [of time and strength] she plants fruitful vines in her vineyard. [S. of Sol. 8:12.] -- proverbs 31:16
.
She girds herself with strength [spiritual, mental, and physical fitness for her God-given task] and makes her arms strong and firm. -- proverbs 31:17
.
She tastes and sees that her gain from work [with and for God] is good; her lamp goes not out, but it burns on continually through the night [of trouble, privation, or sorrow, warning away fear, doubt, and distrust]. -- proverbs 31:18
.
She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. -- proverbs 31:19
.
She opens her hand to the poor, yes, she reaches out her filled hands to the needy [whether in body, mind, or spirit]. -- proverbs 31:20
.
She fears not the snow for her family, for all her household are doubly clothed in scarlet. -- proverbs 31:21
.
She makes for herself coverlets, cushions, and rugs of tapestry. Her clothing is of linen, pure and fine, and of purple [such as that of which the clothing of the priests and the hallowed cloths of the temple were made]. -- proverbs 31:22
.
Her husband is known in the [city's] gates, when he sits among the elders of the land. -- proverbs 31:23
.
She makes fine linen garments and leads others to buy them; she delivers to the merchants girdles [or sashes that free one up for service]. -- proverbs 31:24
.
Strength and dignity are her clothing and her position is strong and secure; she rejoices over the future [the latter day or time to come, knowing that she and her family are in readiness for it]! -- proverbs 31:25
.
She opens her mouth in skillful and godly Wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness [giving counsel and instruction]. -- proverbs 31:26
.
She looks well to how things go in her household, and the bread of idleness (gossip, discontent, and self-pity) she will not eat. -- proverbs 31:27
.
Her children rise up and call her blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied); and her husband boasts of and praises her, [saying], -- proverbs 31:28
.
Many daughters have done virtuously, nobly, and well [with the strength of character that is steadfast in goodness], but you excel them all. -- proverbs 31:29
.
Charm and grace are deceptive, and beauty is vain [because it is not lasting], but a woman who reverently and worshipfully fears the Lord, she shall be praised! -- proverbs 31:30
.
Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates [of the city]! -- proverbs 31:31
.
THE WORDS of the Preacher, the son of David and king in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 1:1
.
Vapor of vapors and futility of futilities, says the Preacher. Vapor of vapors and futility of futilities! All is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and vainglory). -- ecclesiastes 1:2
.
What profit does man have left from all his toil at which he toils under the sun? [Is life worth living?] -- ecclesiastes 1:3
.
One generation goes and another generation comes, but the earth remains forever. -- ecclesiastes 1:4
.
The sun also rises and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises. -- ecclesiastes 1:5
.
The wind goes to the south and circles about to the north; it circles and circles about continually, and on its circuit the wind returns again. -- ecclesiastes 1:6
.
All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place from which the rivers come, to there and from there they return again. -- ecclesiastes 1:7
.
All things are weary with toil and all words are feeble; man cannot utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. -- ecclesiastes 1:8
.
The thing that has been--it is what will be again, and that which has been done is that which will be done again; and there is nothing new under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 1:9
.
Is there a thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? It has already been, in the vast ages of time [recorded or unrecorded] which were before us. -- ecclesiastes 1:10
.
There is no remembrance of former happenings or men, neither will there be any remembrance of happenings of generations that are to come by those who are to come after them. -- ecclesiastes 1:11
.
I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 1:12
.
And I applied myself by heart and mind to seek and search out by [human] wisdom all human activity under heaven. It is a miserable business which God has given to the sons of man with which to busy themselves. -- ecclesiastes 1:13
.
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity, a striving after the wind and a feeding on wind. -- ecclesiastes 1:14
.
What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is defective and lacking cannot be counted. -- ecclesiastes 1:15
.
I entered into counsel with my own mind, saying, Behold, I have acquired great [human] wisdom, yes, more than all who have been over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has had great experience of [moral] wisdom and [scientific] knowledge. -- ecclesiastes 1:16
.
And I gave my mind to know [practical] wisdom and to discern [the character of] madness and folly [in which men seem to find satisfaction]; I perceived that this also is a searching after wind and a feeding on it. -- ecclesiastes 1:17
.
For in much [human] wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. -- ecclesiastes 1:18
.
I SAID in my mind, Come now, I will prove you with mirth and test you with pleasure; so have a good time [enjoy pleasure]. But this also was vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 2:1
.
I said of laughter, It is mad, and of pleasure, What does it accomplish? -- ecclesiastes 2:2
.
I searched in my mind how to cheer my body with wine--yet at the same time having my mind hold its course and guide me with [human] wisdom--and how to lay hold of folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives. -- ecclesiastes 2:3
.
I made great works; I built myself houses, I planted vineyards. -- ecclesiastes 2:4
.
I made for myself gardens and orchards and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees. -- ecclesiastes 2:5
.
I made for myself pools of water from which to water the forest and make the trees bud. -- ecclesiastes 2:6
.
I bought menservants and maidservants and had servants born in my house. Also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 2:7
.
I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got for myself men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men--concubines very many. -- ecclesiastes 2:8
.
So I became great and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me and stood by me. -- ecclesiastes 2:9
.
And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any pleasure, for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my portion and reward for all my toil. -- ecclesiastes 2:10
.
Then I looked on all that my hands had done and the labor I had spent in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it, and there was no profit under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 2:11
.
So I turned to consider [human] wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the man do who succeeds the king? Nothing but what has been done already. -- ecclesiastes 2:12
.
Then I saw that even [human] wisdom [that brings sorrow] is better than [the pleasures of] folly as far as light is better than darkness. -- ecclesiastes 2:13
.
The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness; and yet I perceived that [in the end] one event happens to them both. -- ecclesiastes 2:14
.
Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it will happen even to me. And of what use is it then for me to be more wise? Then I said in my heart, This also is vanity (emptiness, vainglory, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 2:15
.
For of the wise man, the same as of the fool, there is no permanent remembrance, since in the days to come all will be long forgotten. And how does the wise man die? Even as the fool! -- ecclesiastes 2:16
.
So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it. -- ecclesiastes 2:17
.
And I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will succeed me. -- ecclesiastes 2:18
.
And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have dominion over all my labor in which I have toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 2:19
.
So I turned around and gave my heart up to despair over all the labor of my efforts under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 2:20
.
For here is a man whose labor is with wisdom and knowledge and skill; yet to a man who has not toiled for it he must leave it all as his portion. This also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility) and a great evil! -- ecclesiastes 2:21
.
For what has a man left from all his labor and from the striving and vexation of his heart in which he has toiled under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 2:22
.
For all his days are but pain and sorrow, and his work is a vexation and grief; his mind takes no rest even at night. This is also vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 2:23
.
There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and make himself enjoy good in his labor. Even this, I have seen, is from the hand of God. -- ecclesiastes 2:24
.
For who can eat or who can have enjoyment any more than I can--apart from Him ? -- ecclesiastes 2:25
.
For to the person who pleases Him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and heaping up, that he may give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it. -- ecclesiastes 2:26
.
TO EVERYTHING there is a season, and a time for every matter or purpose under heaven: -- ecclesiastes 3:1
.
A time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted, -- ecclesiastes 3:2
.
A time to kill and a time to heal, a time to break down and a time to build up, -- ecclesiastes 3:3
.
A time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, -- ecclesiastes 3:4
.
A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, -- ecclesiastes 3:5
.
A time to get and a time to lose, a time to keep and a time to cast away, -- ecclesiastes 3:6
.
A time to rend and a time to sew, a time to keep silence and a time to speak, -- ecclesiastes 3:7
.
A time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. -- ecclesiastes 3:8
.
What profit remains for the worker from his toil? -- ecclesiastes 3:9
.
I have seen the painful labor and exertion and miserable business which God has given to the sons of men with which to exercise and busy themselves. -- ecclesiastes 3:10
.
He has made everything beautiful in its time. He also has planted eternity in men's hearts and minds [a divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the ages which nothing under the sun but God alone can satisfy], yet so that men cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end. -- ecclesiastes 3:11
.
I know that there is nothing better for them than to be glad and to get and do good as long as they live; -- ecclesiastes 3:12
.
And also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor--it is the gift of God. -- ecclesiastes 3:13
.
I know that whatever God does, it endures forever; nothing can be added to it nor anything taken from it. And God does it so that men will [reverently] fear Him [revere and worship Him, knowing that He is]. -- ecclesiastes 3:14
.
That which is now already has been, and that which is to be already has been; and God seeks that which has passed by [so that history repeats itself]. -- ecclesiastes 3:15
.
Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice there was wickedness, and that in the place of righteousness wickedness was there also. -- ecclesiastes 3:16
.
I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time [appointed] for every matter and purpose and for every work. -- ecclesiastes 3:17
.
I said in my heart regarding the subject of the sons of men, God is trying (separating and sifting) them, that they may see that by themselves [under the sun, without God] they are but like beasts. -- ecclesiastes 3:18
.
For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even [in the end] one thing befalls them both. As the one dies, so dies the other. Yes, they all have one breath and spirit, so that a man has no preeminence over a beast; for all is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 3:19
.
All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. -- ecclesiastes 3:20
.
Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goes downward to the earth? -- ecclesiastes 3:21
.
So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works, for that is his portion. For who shall bring him back to see what will happen after he is gone? -- ecclesiastes 3:22
.
THEN I returned and considered all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun: And I beheld the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they [too] had no comforter. -- ecclesiastes 4:1
.
So I praised and thought more fortunate those who have been long dead than the living, who are still alive. -- ecclesiastes 4:2
.
But better than them both [I thought] is he who has not yet been born, who has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 4:3
.
Then I saw that all painful effort in labor and all skill in work comes from man's rivalry with his neighbor. This is also vanity, a vain striving after the wind and a feeding on it. -- ecclesiastes 4:4
.
The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh [destroying himself by indolence]. -- ecclesiastes 4:5
.
Better is a handful with quietness than both hands full with painful effort, a vain striving after the wind and a feeding on it. -- ecclesiastes 4:6
.
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun [in one of its peculiar forms]. -- ecclesiastes 4:7
.
Here is one alone--no one with him; he neither has child nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his labor, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, neither does he ask, For whom do I labor and deprive myself of good? This is also vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility); yes, it is a painful effort and an unhappy business. -- ecclesiastes 4:8
.
Two are better than one, because they have a good [more satisfying] reward for their labor; -- ecclesiastes 4:9
.
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! -- ecclesiastes 4:10
.
Again, if two lie down together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone? -- ecclesiastes 4:11
.
And though a man might prevail against him who is alone, two will withstand him. A threefold cord is not quickly broken. -- ecclesiastes 4:12
.
Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive counsel (friendly reproof and warning)-- -- ecclesiastes 4:13
.
Even though [the youth] comes out of prison to reign, while the other, born a king, becomes needy. -- ecclesiastes 4:14
.
I saw all the living who walk under the sun with the youth who was to stand up in the king's stead. -- ecclesiastes 4:15
.
There was no end to all the people; he was over all of them. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, vainglory) and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it. -- ecclesiastes 4:16
.
KEEP YOUR foot [give your mind to what you are doing] when you go [as Jacob to sacred Bethel] to the house of God. For to draw near to hear and obey is better than to give the sacrifice of fools [carelessly, irreverently] too ignorant to know that they are doing evil. -- ecclesiastes 5:1
.
Be not rash with your mouth, and let not your heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven, and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few. -- ecclesiastes 5:2
.
For a dream comes with much business and painful effort, and a fool's voice with many words. -- ecclesiastes 5:3
.
When you vow a vow or make a pledge to God, do not put off paying it; for God has no pleasure in fools (those who witlessly mock Him). Pay what you vow. -- ecclesiastes 5:4
.
It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. -- ecclesiastes 5:5
.
Do not allow your mouth to cause your body to sin, and do not say before the messenger [the priest] that it was an error or mistake. Why should God be [made] angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands? -- ecclesiastes 5:6
.
For in a multitude of dreams there is futility and worthlessness, and ruin in a flood of words. But [reverently] fear God [revere and worship Him, knowing that He is]. -- ecclesiastes 5:7
.
If you see the oppression of the poor and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in the state or province, do not marvel at the matter. [Be sure that there are those who will attend to it] for a higher [official] than the high is observing, and higher ones are over them. -- ecclesiastes 5:8
.
Moreover, the profit of the earth is for all; the king himself is served by the field and in all, a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields. -- ecclesiastes 5:9
.
He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance with gain. This also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 5:10
.
When goods increase, they who eat them increase also. And what gain is there to their owner except to see them with his eyes? -- ecclesiastes 5:11
.
The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the fullness of the rich will not let him sleep. -- ecclesiastes 5:12
.
There is a serious and severe evil which I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt. -- ecclesiastes 5:13
.
But those riches are lost in a bad venture; and he becomes the father of a son, and there is nothing in his hand [with which to support the child]. -- ecclesiastes 5:14
.
As [the man] came forth from his mother's womb, so he will go again, naked as he came; and he will take away nothing for all his labor which he can carry in his hand. -- ecclesiastes 5:15
.
And this also is a serious and severe evil--that in all points as he came, so shall he go; and what gain has he who labors for the wind? -- ecclesiastes 5:16
.
All his days also he eats in darkness [cheerlessly, with no sweetness and light in them], and much sorrow and sickness and wrath are his. -- ecclesiastes 5:17
.
Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is for one to eat and drink, and to find enjoyment in all the labor in which he labors under the sun all the days which God gives him--for this is his [allotted] part. -- ecclesiastes 5:18
.
Also, every man to whom God has given riches and possessions, and the power to enjoy them and to accept his appointed lot and to rejoice in his toil--this is the gift of God [to him]. -- ecclesiastes 5:19
.
For he shall not much remember [seriously] the days of his life, because God [Himself] answers and corresponds to the joy of his heart [the tranquillity of God is mirrored in him]. -- ecclesiastes 5:20
.
THERE IS an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavily upon men: -- ecclesiastes 6:1
.
A man to whom God has given riches, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he might desire, yet God does not give him the power or capacity to enjoy them [things which are gifts from God], but a stranger [in whom he has no interest succeeds him and] consumes and enjoys them. This is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility); it is a sore affliction! -- ecclesiastes 6:2
.
If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, but his life is not filled with good, and also he is given no burial [honors nor is laid to rest in the sepulcher of his fathers], I say that [he who had] an untimely birth [resulting in death] is better off than he, -- ecclesiastes 6:3
.
For [the untimely one] comes in futility and goes into darkness, and in darkness his name is covered. -- ecclesiastes 6:4
.
Moreover, he has not seen the sun nor had any knowledge, yet he [the stillborn child] has rest rather than he [who is aware of all that he has missed and all that he would not have had to suffer]. -- ecclesiastes 6:5
.
Even though he lives a thousand years twice over and yet has seen no good and experienced no enjoyment--do not all go to one place [the place of the dead]? -- ecclesiastes 6:6
.
All the labor of man is for his mouth [for self-preservation and enjoyment], and yet his desire is not satisfied. -- ecclesiastes 6:7
.
For what advantage has the wise man over the fool [being worldly-wise is not the secret to happiness]? What advantage has the poor man who has learned how to walk before the living [publicly, with men's eyes upon him; being poor is not the secret to happiness either]? -- ecclesiastes 6:8
.
Better is the sight of the eyes [the enjoyment of what is available to one] than the cravings of wandering desire. This is also vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility) and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it! -- ecclesiastes 6:9
.
Whatever [man] is, he has been named that long ago, and it is known that it is man [Adam]; nor can he contend with Him who is mightier than he [whether God or death]. -- ecclesiastes 6:10
.
Seeing that there are [all these and] many other things and words that increase the emptiness, falsity, vainglory, and futility [of living], what profit and what outcome is there for man? -- ecclesiastes 6:11
.
For who [limited to human wisdom] knows what is good for man in his life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow [going through the motions but accomplishing nothing]? For who can tell a man what will happen [to his work, his treasure, his plans] under the sun after he is gone? -- ecclesiastes 6:12
.
A GOOD name is better than precious perfume, and the day of death better than the day of one's birth. -- ecclesiastes 7:1
.
It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to heart. -- ecclesiastes 7:2
.
Sorrow is better than laughter, for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better and gains gladness. -- ecclesiastes 7:3
.
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth and sensual joy. -- ecclesiastes 7:4
.
It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools. -- ecclesiastes 7:5
.
For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 7:6
.
Surely oppression and extortion make a wise man foolish, and a bribe destroys the understanding and judgment. -- ecclesiastes 7:7
.
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. -- ecclesiastes 7:8
.
Do not be quick in spirit to be angry or vexed, for anger and vexation lodge in the bosom of fools. -- ecclesiastes 7:9
.
Do not say, Why were the old days better than these? For it is not wise or because of wisdom that you ask this. -- ecclesiastes 7:10
.
Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yes, more excellent it is for those [the living] who see the sun. -- ecclesiastes 7:11
.
For wisdom is a defense even as money is a defense, but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom shields and preserves the life of him who has it. -- ecclesiastes 7:12
.
Consider the work of God: who can make straight what He has made crooked? -- ecclesiastes 7:13
.
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider that God has made the one side by side with the other, so that man may not find out anything that shall be after him. -- ecclesiastes 7:14
.
I have seen everything in the days of my vanity (my emptiness, falsity, vainglory, and futility): there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in [spite of] his evildoing. -- ecclesiastes 7:15
.
Be not [morbidly exacting and externally] righteous overmuch, neither strive to make yourself [pretentiously appear] overwise--why should you [get puffed up and] destroy yourself [with presumptuous self-sufficiency]? -- ecclesiastes 7:16
.
[Although all have sinned] be not wicked overmuch or willfully, neither be foolish--why should you die before your time? -- ecclesiastes 7:17
.
It is good that you should take hold of this and from that withdraw not your hand; for he who [reverently] fears and worships God will come forth from them all. -- ecclesiastes 7:18
.
[True] wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers or valiant generals who are in the city. -- ecclesiastes 7:19
.
Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth who does good and never sins. -- ecclesiastes 7:20
.
Do not give heed to everything that is said, lest you hear your servant cursing you-- -- ecclesiastes 7:21
.
For often your own heart knows that you have likewise cursed others. -- ecclesiastes 7:22
.
All this have I tried and proved by wisdom. I said, I will be wise [independently of God]--but it was far from me. -- ecclesiastes 7:23
.
That which is is far off, and that which is deep is very deep--who can find it out [true wisdom independent of the fear of God]? -- ecclesiastes 7:24
.
I turned about [penitent] and my heart was set to know and to search out and to seek [true] wisdom and the reason of things, and to know that wickedness is folly and that foolishness is madness [and what had led me into such wickedness and madness]. -- ecclesiastes 7:25
.
And I found that [of all sinful follies none has been so ruinous in seducing one away from God as idolatrous women] more bitter than death is the woman whose heart is snares and nets and whose hands are bands. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her. -- ecclesiastes 7:26
.
Behold, this I have found, says the Preacher, while weighing one thing after another to find out the right estimate [and the reason]-- -- ecclesiastes 7:27
.
Which I am still seeking but have not found--one upright man among a thousand have I found, but an upright woman among all those [one thousand in my harem] have I not found. -- ecclesiastes 7:28
.
Behold, this is the only [reason for it that] I have found: God made man upright, but they [men and women] have sought out many devices [for evil]. -- ecclesiastes 7:29
.
WHO IS like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his countenance is changed. -- ecclesiastes 8:1
.
I counsel you to keep the king's command, and that in regard to the oath of God [by which you swore to him loyalty]. -- ecclesiastes 8:2
.
Be not panic-stricken and hasty to get out of his presence. Persist not in an evil thing, for he does whatever he pleases. -- ecclesiastes 8:3
.
For the word of a king is authority and power, and who can say to him, What are you doing? -- ecclesiastes 8:4
.
Whoever observes the [king's] command will experience no harm, and a wise man's mind will know both when and what to do. -- ecclesiastes 8:5
.
For every purpose and matter has its [right] time and judgment, although the misery and wickedness of man lies heavily upon him [who rebels against the king]. -- ecclesiastes 8:6
.
For he does not know what is to be, for who can tell him how and when it will be? -- ecclesiastes 8:7
.
There is no man who has power over the spirit to retain the breath of life, neither has he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in battle [against death], neither will wickedness deliver those who are its possessors and given to it. -- ecclesiastes 8:8
.
All this have I seen while applying my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his own hurt or to the other man's. -- ecclesiastes 8:9
.
And so I saw the wicked buried--those who had come and gone out of the holy place [but did not thereby escape their doom], and they are [praised and] forgotten in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, vainglory, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 8:10
.
Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, the hearts of the sons of men are fully set to do evil. -- ecclesiastes 8:11
.
Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his days [seemingly] are prolonged [in his wickedness], yet surely I know that it will be well with those who [reverently] fear God, who revere and worship Him, realizing His continual presence. -- ecclesiastes 8:12
.
But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not [reverently] fear and worship God. -- ecclesiastes 8:13
.
Here also is a futility that goes on upon the earth: there are righteous men who fare as though they were wicked, and wicked men who fare as though they were righteous. I say that this also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 8:14
.
Then I commended enjoyment, because a man has no better thing under the sun [without God] than to eat and to drink and to be joyful, for that will remain with him in his toil through the days of his life which God gives him under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 8:15
.
When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to see the business activity and the painful effort that take place upon the earth--how neither day nor night some men's eyes sleep-- -- ecclesiastes 8:16
.
Then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun--because however much a man may toil in seeking, yet he will not find it out; yes, more than that, though a wise man thinks and claims he knows, yet will he not be able to find it out. -- ecclesiastes 8:17
.
FOR ALL this I took to heart, exploring and examining it all, how the righteous (the upright, in right standing with God) and the wise and their works are in the hands of God. Whether it is to be love or hatred no man knows; all that is before them. -- ecclesiastes 9:1
.
All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices and to him who does not sacrifice. As is the good man, so is the sinner; and he who swears is as he who fears and shuns an oath. -- ecclesiastes 9:2
.
This evil is in all that is done under the sun: one fate comes to all. Also the hearts of men are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead. -- ecclesiastes 9:3
.
[There is no exemption] but he who is joined to all the living has hope--for a living dog is better than a dead lion. -- ecclesiastes 9:4
.
For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; and they have no more reward [here], for the memory of them is forgotten. -- ecclesiastes 9:5
.
Their love and their hatred and their envy have already perished; neither have they any more a share in anything that is done under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 9:6
.
Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart [if you are righteous, wise, and in the hands of God], for God has already accepted your works. -- ecclesiastes 9:7
.
Let your garments be always white [with purity], and let your head not lack [the] oil [of gladness]. -- ecclesiastes 9:8
.
Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun--all the days of futility. For that is your portion in this life and in your work at which you toil under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 9:9
.
Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol (the place of the dead), where you are going. -- ecclesiastes 9:10
.
I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, neither is bread to the wise nor riches to men of intelligence and understanding nor favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all. -- ecclesiastes 9:11
.
For man also knows not his time [of death]: as the fishes are taken in an evil net, and as the birds are caught in the snare, so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when [calamity] falls suddenly upon them. -- ecclesiastes 9:12
.
This [illustration of] wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great to me: -- ecclesiastes 9:13
.
There was a little city with few men in it. And a great king came against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it. -- ecclesiastes 9:14
.
But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no man [seriously] remembered that poor man. -- ecclesiastes 9:15
.
But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heeded. -- ecclesiastes 9:16
.
The words of wise men heard in quiet are better than the shouts of him who rules among fools. -- ecclesiastes 9:17
.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good. -- ecclesiastes 9:18
.
DEAD FLIES cause the ointment of the perfumer to putrefy [and] send forth a vile odor; so does a little folly [in him who is valued for wisdom] outweigh wisdom and honor. -- ecclesiastes 10:1
.
A wise man's heart turns him toward his right hand, but a fool's heart toward his left. -- ecclesiastes 10:2
.
Even when he who is a fool walks along the road, his heart and understanding fail him, and he says of everyone and to everyone that he is a fool. -- ecclesiastes 10:3
.
If the temper of the ruler rises up against you, do not leave your place [or show a resisting spirit]; for gentleness and calmness prevent or put a stop to great offenses. -- ecclesiastes 10:4
.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceeds from the ruler: -- ecclesiastes 10:5
.
Folly is set in great dignity and in high places, and the rich sit in low places. -- ecclesiastes 10:6
.
I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking like slaves on the earth. -- ecclesiastes 10:7
.
He who digs a pit [for others] will fall into it, and whoever breaks through a fence or a [stone] wall, a serpent will bite him. -- ecclesiastes 10:8
.
Whoever removes [landmark] stones or hews out [new ones with similar intent] will be hurt with them, and he who fells trees will be endangered by them. -- ecclesiastes 10:9
.
If the ax is dull and the man does not whet the edge, he must put forth more strength; but wisdom helps him to succeed. -- ecclesiastes 10:10
.
If the serpent bites before it is charmed, then it is no use to call a charmer [and the slanderer is no better than the uncharmed snake]. -- ecclesiastes 10:11
.
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious and win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him. -- ecclesiastes 10:12
.
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is wicked madness. -- ecclesiastes 10:13
.
A fool also multiplies words, though no man can tell what will be--and what will happen after he is gone, who can tell him? -- ecclesiastes 10:14
.
The labor of fools wearies every one of them, because [he is so ignorant of the ordinary matters that] he does not even know how to get to town. -- ecclesiastes 10:15
.
Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child or a servant and when your officials feast in the morning! -- ecclesiastes 10:16
.
Happy (fortunate and to be envied) are you, O land, when your king is a free man and of noble birth and character and when your officials feast at the proper time--for strength and not for drunkenness! -- ecclesiastes 10:17
.
Through indolence the rafters [of state affairs] decay and the roof sinks in, and through idleness of the hands the house leaks. -- ecclesiastes 10:18
.
[Instead of repairing the breaches, the officials] make a feast for laughter, serve wine to cheer life, and [depend on tax] money to answer for all of it. -- ecclesiastes 10:19
.
Curse not the king, no, not even in your thoughts, and curse not the rich in your bedchamber, for a bird of the air will carry the voice, and a winged creature will tell the matter. -- ecclesiastes 10:20
.
CAST YOUR bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days. -- ecclesiastes 11:1
.
Give a portion to seven, yes, even [divide it] to eight, for you know not what evil may come upon the earth. -- ecclesiastes 11:2
.
If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie. -- ecclesiastes 11:3
.
He who observes the wind [and waits for all conditions to be favorable] will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap. -- ecclesiastes 11:4
.
As you know not what is the way of the wind, or how the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a pregnant woman, even so you know not the work of God, Who does all. -- ecclesiastes 11:5
.
In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hands, for you know not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether both alike will be good. -- ecclesiastes 11:6
.
Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. -- ecclesiastes 11:7
.
Yes, if a man should live many years, let him rejoice in them all; yet let him [seriously] remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All that comes is vanity (emptiness, falsity, vainglory, and futility)! -- ecclesiastes 11:8
.
Rejoice, O young man, in your adolescence, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your [full-grown] youth. And walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment. -- ecclesiastes 11:9
.
Therefore remove [the lusts that end in] sorrow and vexation from your heart and mind and put away evil from your body, for youth and the dawn of life are vanity [transitory, idle, empty, and devoid of truth]. -- ecclesiastes 11:10
.
REMEMBER [earnestly] also your Creator [that you are not your own, but His property now] in the days of your youth, before the evil days come or the years draw near when you will say [of physical pleasures], I have no enjoyment in them-- -- ecclesiastes 12:1
.
Before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened [sight is impaired], and the clouds [of depression] return after the rain [of tears]; -- ecclesiastes 12:2
.
In the day when the keepers of the house [the hands and the arms] tremble, and the strong men [the feet and the knees] bow themselves, and the grinders [the molar teeth] cease because they are few, and those who look out of the windows [the eyes] are darkened; -- ecclesiastes 12:3
.
When the doors [the lips] are shut in the streets and the sound of the grinding [of the teeth] is low, and one rises up at the voice of a bird and the crowing of a cock, and all the daughters of music [the voice and the ear] are brought low; -- ecclesiastes 12:4
.
Also when [the old] are afraid of danger from that which is high, and fears are in the way, and the almond tree [their white hair] blooms, and the grasshopper [a little thing] is a burden, and desire and appetite fail, because man goes to his everlasting home and the mourners go about the streets or marketplaces. -- ecclesiastes 12:5
.
[Remember your Creator earnestly now] before the silver cord [of life] is snapped apart, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern [and the whole circulatory system of the blood ceases to function]; -- ecclesiastes 12:6
.
Then shall the dust [out of which God made man's body] return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to God Who gave it. -- ecclesiastes 12:7
.
Vapor of vapors and futility of futilities, says the Preacher. All is futility (emptiness, falsity, vainglory, and transitoriness)! -- ecclesiastes 12:8
.
And furthermore, because the Preacher was wise, he [Solomon] still taught the people knowledge; and he pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs. -- ecclesiastes 12:9
.
The Preacher sought acceptable words, even to write down rightly words of truth or correct sentiment. -- ecclesiastes 12:10
.
The words of the wise are like prodding goads, and firmly fixed [in the mind] like nails are the collected sayings which are given [as proceeding] from one Shepherd. -- ecclesiastes 12:11
.
But about going further [than the words given by one Shepherd], my son, be warned. Of making many books there is no end [so do not believe everything you read], and much study is a weariness of the flesh. -- ecclesiastes 12:12
.
All has been heard; the end of the matter is: Fear God [revere and worship Him, knowing that He is] and keep His commandments, for this is the whole of man [the full, original purpose of his creation, the object of God's providence, the root of character, the foundation of all happiness, the adjustment to all inharmonious circumstances and conditions under the sun] and the whole [duty] for every man. -- ecclesiastes 12:13
.
For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it is good or evil. -- ecclesiastes 12:14
.
THE SONG of songs [the most excellent of them all] which is Solomon's. -- song of solomon 1:1
.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! [she cries. Then, realizing that Solomon has arrived and has heard her speech, she turns to him and adds] For your love is better than wine! -- song of solomon 1:2
.
[And she continues] The odor of your ointments is fragrant; your name is like perfume poured out. Therefore do the maidens love you. -- song of solomon 1:3
.
Draw me! We will run after you! The king brings me into his apartments! We will be glad and rejoice in you! We will recall [when we were favored with] your love, more fragrant than wine. The upright [are not offended at your choice, but sincerely] love you. -- song of solomon 1:4
.
I am so black; but [you are] lovely and pleasant [the ladies assured her]. O you daughters of Jerusalem, [I am as dark] as the tents of [the Bedouin tribe] Kedar, like the [beautiful] curtains of Solomon! -- song of solomon 1:5
.
[Please] do not look at me, [she said, for] I am swarthy. [I have worked out] in the sun and it has left its mark upon me. My stepbrothers were angry with me, and they made me keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard [my complexion] I have not kept. -- song of solomon 1:6
.
[Addressing her shepherd, she said] Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon. For why should I [as I think of you] be as a veiled one straying beside the flocks of your companions? -- song of solomon 1:7
.
If you do not know [where your lover is], O you fairest among women, run along, follow the tracks of the flock, and [amuse yourself by] pasturing your kids beside the shepherds' tents. -- song of solomon 1:8
.
O my love [he said as he saw her], you remind me of my [favorite] mare in the chariot spans of Pharaoh. -- song of solomon 1:9
.
Your cheeks are comely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels. -- song of solomon 1:10
.
We will make for you chains and ornaments of gold, studded with silver. -- song of solomon 1:11
.
While the king sits at his table [she said], my spikenard [my absent lover] sends forth [his] fragrance [over me]. -- song of solomon 1:12
.
My beloved [shepherd] is to me like a [scent] bag of myrrh that lies in my bosom. -- song of solomon 1:13
.
My beloved [shepherd] is to me a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of En-gedi [famed for its fragrant shrubs]. -- song of solomon 1:14
.
Behold, you are beautiful, my love! Behold, you are beautiful! You have doves' eyes. -- song of solomon 1:15
.
[She cried] Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved [shepherd], yes, delightful! Our arbor and couch are green and leafy. -- song of solomon 1:16
.
The beams of our house are cedars, and our rafters and panels are cypresses or pines. -- song of solomon 1:17
.
[SHE SAID] I am only a little rose or autumn crocus of the plain of Sharon, or a [humble] lily of the valleys [that grows in deep and difficult places]. -- song of solomon 2:1
.
But Solomon replied, Like the lily among thorns, so are you, my love, among the daughters. -- song of solomon 2:2
.
Like an apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved [shepherd] among the sons [cried the girl]! Under his shadow I delighted to sit, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. -- song of solomon 2:3
.
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love [for love waved as a protecting and comforting banner over my head when I was near him]. -- song of solomon 2:4
.
Sustain me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love. -- song of solomon 2:5
.
[I can feel] his left hand under my head and his right hand embraces me! -- song of solomon 2:6
.
[He said] I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field [which are free to follow their own instincts] that you not try to stir up or awaken [my] love until it pleases. -- song of solomon 2:7
.
[Vividly she pictured it] The voice of my beloved [shepherd]! Behold, he comes, leaping upon the mountains, bounding over the hills. -- song of solomon 2:8
.
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. Behold, he stands behind the wall of our house, he looks in through the windows, he glances through the lattice. -- song of solomon 2:9
.
My beloved speaks and says to me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. -- song of solomon 2:10
.
For, behold, the winter is past; the rain is over and gone. -- song of solomon 2:11
.
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing [of birds] has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. -- song of solomon 2:12
.
The fig tree puts forth and ripens her green figs, and the vines are in blossom and give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. -- song of solomon 2:13
.
[So I went with him, and when we were climbing the rocky steps up the hillside, my beloved shepherd said to me] O my dove, [while you are here] in the seclusion of the clefts in the solid rock, in the sheltered and secret place of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. -- song of solomon 2:14
.
[My heart was touched and I fervently sang to him my desire] Take for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards [of our love], for our vineyards are in blossom. -- song of solomon 2:15
.
[She said distinctly] My beloved is mine and I am his! He pastures his flocks among the lilies. -- song of solomon 2:16
.
[Then, longingly addressing her absent shepherd, she cried] Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, return hastily, O my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young hart as you cover the mountains [which separate us]. -- song of solomon 2:17
.
IN THE night I dreamed that I sought the one whom I love. [She said] I looked for him but could not find him. -- song of solomon 3:1
.
So I decided to go out into the city, into the streets and broad ways [which are so confusing to a country girl], and seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I could not find him. -- song of solomon 3:2
.
The watchmen who go about the city found me, to whom I said, Have you seen him whom my soul loves? -- song of solomon 3:3
.
I had gone but a little way past them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who conceived me. -- song of solomon 3:4
.
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field that you stir not up nor awaken love until it pleases. -- song of solomon 3:5
.
Who or what is this [she asked] that comes gliding out of the wilderness like stately pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh, frankincense, and all the fragrant powders of the merchant? -- song of solomon 3:6
.
[Someone answered] Behold, it is the traveling litter (the bridal car) of Solomon. Sixty mighty men are around it, of the mighty men of Israel. -- song of solomon 3:7
.
They all handle the sword and are expert in war; every man has his sword upon his thigh, that fear be not excited in the night. -- song of solomon 3:8
.
King Solomon made himself a car or a palanquin from the [cedar] wood of Lebanon. -- song of solomon 3:9
.
He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple, the inside of it lovingly and intricately wrought in needlework by the daughters of Jerusalem. -- song of solomon 3:10
.
Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and gaze upon King Solomon wearing the crown with which his mother [Bathsheba] crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of his gladness of heart. -- song of solomon 3:11
.
HOW FAIR you are, my love [he said], how very fair! Your eyes behind your veil [remind me] of those of a dove; your hair [makes me think of the black, wavy fleece] of a flock of [the Arabian] goats which one sees trailing down Mount Gilead [beyond the Jordan on the frontiers of the desert]. -- song of solomon 4:1
.
Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes which have come up from the washing, of which all are in pairs, and none is missing among them. -- song of solomon 4:2
.
Your lips are like a thread of scarlet, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. -- song of solomon 4:3
.
Your neck is like the tower of David, built for an arsenal, whereon hang a thousand bucklers, all of them shields of warriors. -- song of solomon 4:4
.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, like twins of a gazelle that feed among the lilies. -- song of solomon 4:5
.
Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, [in my thoughts] I will get to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense [to him whom my soul adores]. -- song of solomon 4:6
.
[He exclaimed] O my love, how beautiful you are! There is no flaw in you! -- song of solomon 4:7
.
Come away with me from Lebanon, my [promised] bride, come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the top of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. -- song of solomon 4:8
.
You have ravished my heart and given me courage, my sister, my [promised] bride; you have ravished my heart and given me courage with one look from your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace. -- song of solomon 4:9
.
How beautiful is your love, my sister, my [promised] bride! How much better is your love than wine! And the fragrance of your ointments than all spices! -- song of solomon 4:10
.
Your lips, O my [promised] bride, drop honey as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue. And the odor of your garments is like the odor of Lebanon. -- song of solomon 4:11
.
A garden enclosed and barred is my sister, my [promised] bride--a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. -- song of solomon 4:12
.
Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates or a paradise with precious fruits, henna with spikenard plants, -- song of solomon 4:13
.
Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes, with all the chief spices. -- song of solomon 4:14
.
You are a fountain [springing up] in a garden, a well of living waters, and flowing streams from Lebanon. -- song of solomon 4:15
.
[You have called me a garden, she said] Oh, I pray that the [cold] north wind and the [soft] south wind may blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out [in abundance for you in whom my soul delights]. Let my beloved come into his garden and eat its choicest fruits. -- song of solomon 4:16
.
I HAVE come into my garden, my sister, my [promised] bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my balsam and spice [from your sweet words I have gathered the richest perfumes and spices]. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends [feast on, O revelers of the palace; you can never make my lover disloyal to me]! Drink, yes, drink abundantly of love, O precious one [for now I know you are mine, irrevocably mine! With his confident words still thrilling her heart, through the lattice she saw her shepherd turn away and disappear into the night]. -- song of solomon 5:1
.
I went to sleep, but my heart stayed awake. [I dreamed that I heard] the voice of my beloved as he knocked [at the door of my mother's cottage]. Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my spotless one [he said], for I am wet with the [heavy] night dew; my hair is covered with it. -- song of solomon 5:2
.
[But weary from a day in the vineyards, I had already sought my rest] I had put off my garment--how could I [again] put it on? I had washed my feet--how could I [again] soil them? -- song of solomon 5:3
.
My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him. -- song of solomon 5:4
.
I rose up to open for my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid [sweet-scented] myrrh, [which he had left] upon the handles of the bolt. -- song of solomon 5:5
.
I opened for my beloved, but my beloved had turned away and withdrawn himself, and was gone! My soul went forth [to him] when he spoke, but it failed me [and now he was gone]! I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. -- song of solomon 5:6
.
The watchmen who go about the city found me. They struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took my veil and my mantle from me. -- song of solomon 5:7
.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am sick from love [simply sick to be with him]. -- song of solomon 5:8
.
What is your beloved more than another beloved, O you fairest among women [taunted the ladies]? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you should give us such a charge? -- song of solomon 5:9
.
[She said] My beloved is fair and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand! -- song of solomon 5:10
.
His head is [as precious as] the finest gold; his locks are curly and bushy and black as a raven. -- song of solomon 5:11
.
His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, bathed in milk and fitly set. -- song of solomon 5:12
.
His cheeks are like a bed of spices or balsam, like banks of sweet herbs yielding fragrance. His lips are like bloodred anemones or lilies distilling liquid [sweet-scented] myrrh. -- song of solomon 5:13
.
His hands are like rods of gold set with [nails of] beryl or topaz. His body is a figure of bright ivory overlaid with [veins of] sapphires. -- song of solomon 5:14
.
His legs are like strong and steady pillars of marble set upon bases of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent, stately, and majestic as the cedars. -- song of solomon 5:15
.
His voice and speech are exceedingly sweet; yes, he is altogether lovely [the whole of him delights and is precious]. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem! -- song of solomon 5:16
.
WHERE HAS your beloved gone, O you fairest among women? [Again the ladies showed their interest in the remarkable person whom the Shulammite had championed with such unstinted praise; they too wanted to know him, they insisted.] Where is your beloved hiding himself? For we would seek him with you. -- song of solomon 6:1
.
[She replied] My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies. -- song of solomon 6:2
.
I am my beloved's [garden] and my beloved is mine! He feeds among the lilies [which grow there]. -- song of solomon 6:3
.
[He said] You are as beautiful as Tirzah [capital of the northern kingdom's first king], my love, and as comely as Jerusalem, [but you are] as terrible as a bannered host! -- song of solomon 6:4
.
Turn away your [flashing] eyes from me, for they have overcome me! Your hair is like a flock of goats trailing down from Mount Gilead. -- song of solomon 6:5
.
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes coming from their washing, of which all are in pairs, and not one of them is missing. -- song of solomon 6:6
.
Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. -- song of solomon 6:7
.
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number; -- song of solomon 6:8
.
But my dove, my undefiled and perfect one, stands alone [above them all]; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her and called her blessed and happy, yes, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. -- song of solomon 6:9
.
[The ladies asked] Who is this that looks forth like the dawn, fair as the moon, clear and pure as the sun, and terrible as a bannered host? -- song of solomon 6:10
.
[The Shulammite replied] I went down into the nut orchard [one day] to look at the green plants of the valley, to see whether the grapevine had budded and the pomegranates were in flower. -- song of solomon 6:11
.
Before I was aware [of what was happening], my desire [to roam about] had brought me into the area of the princes of my people [the king's retinue]. -- song of solomon 6:12
.
[I began to flee, but they called to me] Return, return, O Shulammite; return, return, that we may look upon you! [I replied] What is there for you to see in the [poor little] Shulammite? [And they answered] As upon a dance before two armies or a dance of Mahanaim. -- song of solomon 6:13
.
[THEN HER companions began noticing and commenting on the attractiveness of her person] How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O queenly maiden! Your rounded limbs are like jeweled chains, the work of a master hand. -- song of solomon 7:1
.
Your body is like a round goblet in which no mixed wine is wanting. Your abdomen is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies. -- song of solomon 7:2
.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, the twins of a gazelle. -- song of solomon 7:3
.
Your neck is like a tower of ivory, your eyes like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus. -- song of solomon 7:4
.
Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple. [Then seeing the king watching the girl in absorbed admiration, the speaker added] The king is held captive by its tresses. -- song of solomon 7:5
.
[The king came forward, saying] How fair and how pleasant you are, O love, with your delights! -- song of solomon 7:6
.
Your stature is like that of a palm tree, and your bosom like its clusters [of dates, declared the king]. -- song of solomon 7:7
.
I resolve that I will climb the palm tree; I will grasp its branches. Let your breasts be like clusters of the grapevine, and the scent of your breath like apples, -- song of solomon 7:8
.
And your kisses like the best wine--[then the Shulammite interrupted] that goes down smoothly and sweetly for my beloved [shepherd, kisses] gliding over his lips while he sleeps! -- song of solomon 7:9
.
[She proudly said] I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me! -- song of solomon 7:10
.
[She said] Come, my beloved! Let us go forth into the field, let us lodge in the villages. -- song of solomon 7:11
.
Let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened, and whether the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love. -- song of solomon 7:12
.
The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and over our doors are all manner of choice fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved! -- song of solomon 7:13
.
[LOOKING FORWARD to the shepherd's arrival, the eager girl pictures their meeting and says] Oh, that you were like my brother, who nursed from the breasts of my mother! If I should find you without, I would kiss you, yes, and none would despise me [for it]. -- song of solomon 8:1
.
I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother, who would instruct me. I would cause you to drink spiced wine and of the juice of my pomegranates. -- song of solomon 8:2
.
[Then musingly she added] Oh, that his left hand were under my head and that his right hand embraced me! -- song of solomon 8:3
.
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you never [again attempt to] stir up or awaken love until it pleases. -- song of solomon 8:4
.
Who is this who comes up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved? [And as they sighted the home of her childhood, the bride said] Under the apple tree I awakened you; there your mother gave you birth, there she was in travail and bore you. -- song of solomon 8:5
.
Set me like a seal upon your heart, like a seal upon your arm; for love is as strong as death, jealousy is as hard and cruel as Sheol (the place of the dead). Its flashes are flashes of fire, a most vehement flame [the very flame of the Lord]! -- song of solomon 8:6
.
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man would offer all the goods of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned and despised. -- song of solomon 8:7
.
[Gathered with her family and the wedding guests in her mother's cottage, the bride said to her stepbrothers, When I was a little girl, you said] We have a little sister and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for in marriage? -- song of solomon 8:8
.
If she is a wall [discreet and womanly], we will build upon her a turret [a dowry] of silver; but if she is a door [bold and flirtatious], we will enclose her with boards of cedar. -- song of solomon 8:9
.
[Well] I am a wall [with battlements], and my breasts are like the towers of it. Then was I in [the king's] eyes as one [to be respected and to be allowed] to find peace. -- song of solomon 8:10
.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; everyone was to bring him a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit. -- song of solomon 8:11
.
You, O Solomon, can have your thousand [pieces of silver], and those who tend the fruit of it two hundred; but my vineyard, which is mine [with all its radiant joy], is before me! -- song of solomon 8:12
.
O you who dwell in the gardens, your companions have been listening to your voice--now cause me to hear it. -- song of solomon 8:13
.
[Joyfully the radiant bride turned to him, the one altogether lovely, the chief among ten thousand to her soul, and with unconcealed eagerness to begin her life of sweet companionship with him, she answered] Make haste, my beloved, and come quickly, like a gazelle or a young hart [and take me to our waiting home] upon the mountains of spices! -- song of solomon 8:14
.
IN THE third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. -- daniel 1:1
.
And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with a part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar [Babylonia] to the house of his god and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god. -- daniel 1:2
.
And the [Babylonian] king told Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring in some of the children of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility-- -- daniel 1:3
.
Youths without blemish, well-favored in appearance and skillful in all wisdom, discernment, and understanding, apt in learning knowledge, competent to stand and serve in the king's palace--and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans. -- daniel 1:4
.
And the king assigned for them a daily portion of his own rich and dainty food and of the wine which he drank. They were to be so educated and so nourished for three years that at the end of that time they might stand before the king. -- daniel 1:5
.
Among these were of the children of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. -- daniel 1:6
.
The chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar [the king's attendant], Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego. -- daniel 1:7
.
But Daniel determined in his heart that he would not defile himself by [eating his portion of] the king's rich and dainty food or by [drinking] the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might [be allowed] not to defile himself. -- daniel 1:8
.
Now God made Daniel to find favor, compassion, and loving-kindness with the chief of the eunuchs. -- daniel 1:9
.
And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear, lest my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink, should see your faces worse looking or more sad than the other youths of your age. Then you would endanger my head with the king. -- daniel 1:10
.
Then said Daniel to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, -- daniel 1:11
.
Prove your servants, I beseech you, for ten days and let us be given a vegetable diet and water to drink. -- daniel 1:12
.
Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat of the king's [rich] dainties be observed and compared by you, and deal with us your servants according to what you see. -- daniel 1:13
.
So [the man] consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days. -- daniel 1:14
.
And at the end of ten days it was seen that they were looking better and had taken on more flesh than all the youths who ate of the king's rich dainties. -- daniel 1:15
.
So the steward took away their [rich] dainties and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables. -- daniel 1:16
.
As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all [kinds of] visions and dreams. -- daniel 1:17
.
Now at the end of the time which the king had set for bringing [all the young men in], the chief of the eunuchs brought them before Nebuchadnezzar. -- daniel 1:18
.
And the king conversed with them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they were assigned to stand before the king. -- daniel 1:19
.
And in all matters of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king asked them, he found them ten times better than all the [learned] magicians and enchanters who were in his whole realm. -- daniel 1:20
.
And Daniel continued there even to the first year of King Cyrus [at the close of the seventy years' exile of Judah in Babylonia, which Jeremiah had foretold]. -- daniel 1:21
.
IN THE second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams by which his spirit was troubled and agitated and his sleep went from him. -- daniel 2:1
.
Then the king commanded to call the magicians, the enchanters or soothsayers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans [diviners], to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. -- daniel 2:2
.
And the king said to them, I had a dream and my spirit is troubled to know the dream. -- daniel 2:3
.
Then said the Chaldeans [diviners] to the king in Aramaic [the Syrian language], O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation. -- daniel 2:4
.
The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me! And the decree goes forth from me and I say it with all emphasis: if you do not make known to me the dream with its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill! -- daniel 2:5
.
But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So show me the dream and the interpretation of it. -- daniel 2:6
.
They answered again, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it. -- daniel 2:7
.
The king answered, I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see the thing is gone from me and because you see that my word [against you] is sure: -- daniel 2:8
.
If you will not make known to me the dream, there is but one sentence for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me [hoping to delay your execution] until the time is changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me the interpretation of it. -- daniel 2:9
.
The Chaldeans [diviners] answered before the king and said, There is not a man on earth who can show the king this matter, for no king, lord, or ruler has [ever] asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean. -- daniel 2:10
.
A rare and weighty thing indeed the king requires! None except the gods can reveal it to the king, and their dwelling is not with [human] flesh. -- daniel 2:11
.
For this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. -- daniel 2:12
.
So the decree went forth that the wise men were to be killed, and [the officers] sought Daniel and his companions to be slain. -- daniel 2:13
.
Then Daniel returned an answer which was full of prudence and wisdom to Arioch the captain or executioner of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:14
.
He said to Arioch, the king's captain, Why is the decree so urgent and hasty from the king? Then Arioch explained the matter to Daniel. -- daniel 2:15
.
And Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would set a date and give him time, and he would show the king the interpretation. -- daniel 2:16
.
Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, -- daniel 2:17
.
So that they would desire and request mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:18
.
Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven. -- daniel 2:19
.
Daniel answered, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever! For wisdom and might are His! -- daniel 2:20
.
He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and sets up kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding! -- daniel 2:21
.
He reveals the deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with Him! -- daniel 2:22
.
I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers, Who has given me wisdom and might and has made known to me now what we desired of You, for You have made known to us the solution to the king's problem. -- daniel 2:23
.
Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him: Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation. -- daniel 2:24
.
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus to him: I have found a man of the captives of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation [of his dream]. -- daniel 2:25
.
The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and the interpretation of it? -- daniel 2:26
.
Daniel answered the king, The [mysterious] secret which the king has demanded neither the wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers can show the king, -- daniel 2:27
.
But there is a God in heaven Who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what it is that shall be in the latter days (at the end of days). Your dream and the visions in your head upon your bed are these: -- daniel 2:28
.
As for you, O king, as you were lying upon your bed thoughts came into your mind about what should come to pass hereafter, and He Who reveals secrets was making known to you what shall come to pass. -- daniel 2:29
.
But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than anyone else living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king and that you may know the thoughts of your heart and mind. -- daniel 2:30
.
You, O king, saw, and behold, [there was] a great image. This image which was mighty and of exceedingly great brightness stood before you, and the appearance of it was frightening and terrible. -- daniel 2:31
.
As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, -- daniel 2:32
.
Its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay [the baked clay of the potter]. -- daniel 2:33
.
As you looked, a Stone was cut out without human hands, which smote the image on its feet of iron and [baked] clay [of the potter] and broke them to pieces. -- daniel 2:34
.
Then the iron, the [baked] clay [of the potter], the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken and crushed together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors, and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them could be found. And the Stone that smote the image became a great mountain or rock and filled the whole earth. -- daniel 2:35
.
This was the dream, and we will tell the interpretation of it to the king. -- daniel 2:36
.
You, O king, are king of the [earthly] kings to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the might, and the glory. -- daniel 2:37
.
And wherever the children of men dwell, and the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens--He has given them into your hand and has made you to rule over them all. You [king of Babylon] are the head of gold. -- daniel 2:38
.
And after you shall arise another kingdom [the Medo-Persian], inferior to you, and still a third kingdom of bronze [Greece under Alexander the Great] which shall bear rule over all the earth. -- daniel 2:39
.
And the fourth kingdom [Rome] shall be strong as iron, since iron breaks to pieces and subdues all things; and like iron which crushes, it shall break and crush all these. -- daniel 2:40
.
And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of [baked] clay [of the potter] and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it some of the firmness and strength of iron, just as you saw the iron mixed with miry [earthen] clay. -- daniel 2:41
.
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of [baked] clay [of the potter], so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle and broken. -- daniel 2:42
.
And as you saw the iron mixed with miry and earthen clay, so they shall mingle themselves in the seed of men [in marriage bonds]; but they will not hold together [for two such elements or ideologies can never harmonize], even as iron does not mingle itself with clay. -- daniel 2:43
.
And in the days of these [final ten] kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it shall break and crush and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever. -- daniel 2:44
.
Just as you saw that the Stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. The dream is certain and the interpretation of it is sure. -- daniel 2:45
.
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid homage to Daniel [as a great prophet of the highest God] and ordered that an offering and incense should be offered up to him [in honor of his God]. -- daniel 2:46
.
The king answered Daniel, Of a truth your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a Revealer of secret mysteries, seeing that you could reveal this secret mystery! -- daniel 2:47
.
Then the king made Daniel great and gave him many great gifts, and he made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:48
.
And Daniel requested of the king and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained in the gate of the king [at the king's court]. -- daniel 2:49
.
NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE king [caused to be] made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits or ninety feet and its breadth six cubits or nine feet. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. -- daniel 3:1
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, the governors, the judges and chief stargazers, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs and lawyers, and all the chief officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had [caused to be] set up. -- daniel 3:2
.
Then the satraps, the deputies, the governors, the judges and chief stargazers, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs and lawyers, and all the chief officials of the provinces were gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. -- daniel 3:3
.
Then the herald cried aloud, You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, -- daniel 3:4
.
That when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, dulcimer or bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. -- daniel 3:5
.
And whoever does not fall down and worship shall that very hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:6
.
Therefore, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, dulcimer or bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. -- daniel 3:7
.
Therefore at that time certain men of Chaldean descent came near and brought [malicious] accusations against the Jews. -- daniel 3:8
.
They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever! -- daniel 3:9
.
You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, dulcimer or bagpipe, and every kind of music shall fall down and worship the golden image, -- daniel 3:10
.
And that whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:11
.
There are certain Jews whom you have appointed and set over the affairs of the province of Babylon--Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up. -- daniel 3:12
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; and these men were brought before the king. -- daniel 3:13
.
[Then] Nebuchadnezzar said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up? -- daniel 3:14
.
Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, dulcimer or bagpipe, and every kind of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, very good. But if you do not worship, you shall be cast at once into the midst of a burning fiery furnace, and who is that god who can deliver you out of my hands? -- daniel 3:15
.
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, it is not necessary for us to answer you on this point. -- daniel 3:16
.
If our God Whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, He will deliver us out of your hand, O king. -- daniel 3:17
.
But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up! -- daniel 3:18
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury and his facial expression was changed [to antagonism] against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Therefore he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times hotter than it was usually heated. -- daniel 3:19
.
And he commanded the strongest men in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:20
.
Then these [three] men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics or undergarments, their turbans, and their other clothing, and they were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:21
.
Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame and sparks from the fire killed those men who handled Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. -- daniel 3:22
.
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:23
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king [saw and] was astounded, and he jumped up and said to his counselors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered, True, O king. -- daniel 3:24
.
He answered, Behold, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt! And the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods! -- daniel 3:25
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come out and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the midst of the fire. -- daniel 3:26
.
And the satraps, the deputies, the governors, and the king's counselors gathered around together and saw these men--that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed; neither were their garments scorched or changed in color or condition, nor had even the smell of smoke clung to them. -- daniel 3:27
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, Who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who believed in, trusted in, and relied on Him! And they set aside the king's command and yielded their bodies rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. -- daniel 3:28
.
Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, and language that speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses be made a dunghill, for there is no other God who can deliver in this way! -- daniel 3:29
.
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon. -- daniel 3:30
.
NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE king, to all people, nations, and languages that dwell on all the earth: May peace be multiplied to you! -- daniel 4:1
.
It seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed toward me. -- daniel 4:2
.
How great are His signs! And how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation. -- daniel 4:3
.
I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house and prospering in my palace. -- daniel 4:4
.
I had a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts and imaginations and the visions of my head as I was lying upon my bed troubled and agitated me. -- daniel 4:5
.
Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. -- daniel 4:6
.
Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me the interpretation of it. -- daniel 4:7
.
But at last Daniel came in before me--he who was named Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God--and I told the dream before him, saying, -- daniel 4:8
.
O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the Spirit of the Holy God is in you and no secret mystery is a burden or troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and the interpretation of it. -- daniel 4:9
.
The visions of my head [as I lay] on my bed were these: I saw, and behold, [there was] a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great. -- daniel 4:10
.
The tree grew and was strong and its height reached to the heavens, and the sight of it reached to the end of the whole earth. -- daniel 4:11
.
Its leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The living creatures of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches; and all flesh was fed from it. -- daniel 4:12
.
I saw in the visions of my head [as I lay] on my bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven. -- daniel 4:13
.
He cried aloud [with might] and said, Cut down the tree and cut off its branches; shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the living creatures flee from under it and the fowls from its branches. -- daniel 4:14
.
Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the midst of the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let him share the lot of the living creatures in the grass of the earth. -- daniel 4:15
.
Let his nature and understanding be changed from a man's and let a beast's nature and understanding be given him, and let seven times [or years] pass over him. -- daniel 4:16
.
This sentence is by the decree of the [heavenly] watchers and the decision is by the word of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the Most High [God] rules the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whomever He will and sets over it the humblest and lowliest of men. -- daniel 4:17
.
This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. And you, O Belteshazzar [Daniel], declare now its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the Spirit of the Holy God is in you. -- daniel 4:18
.
Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished and dismayed and stricken dumb for a while [concerned about the king's destiny], and his thoughts troubled, agitated, and alarmed him. The king said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream or its interpretation trouble or alarm you. Belteshazzar answered, My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its message for your enemies. -- daniel 4:19
.
The tree that you saw, which grew [great] and was strong, whose height reached to the heavens and which was visible to all the earth, -- daniel 4:20
.
Whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, on which was food for all, under which the living creatures of the field dwelt, and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their nests-- -- daniel 4:21
.
It is you, O king, who have grown and become strong; your greatness has increased and it reaches to the heavens, and your dominion to the ends of the earth. -- daniel 4:22
.
And whereas the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, Cut the tree down and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth with a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let his portion be with the living creatures of the field until seven times [or years] pass over him-- -- daniel 4:23
.
This is the interpretation, O king: It is the decree of the Most High [God] which has come upon my lord the king: -- daniel 4:24
.
You shall be driven from among men and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; you shall be made to eat grass as do the oxen and you shall be wet with the dew of the heavens; and seven times [or years] shall pass over you until you learn and know and recognize that the Most High [God] rules the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whomever He will. -- daniel 4:25
.
And in that it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be sure to you after you have learned and know that [the God of] heaven rules. -- daniel 4:26
.
Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you; break off your sins and show the reality of your repentance by righteousness (right standing with God and moral and spiritual rectitude and rightness in every area and relation) and liberate yourself from your iniquities by showing mercy and loving-kindness to the poor and oppressed, that [if the king will repent] there may possibly be a continuance and lengthening of your peace and tranquility and a healing of your error. -- daniel 4:27
.
All this was fulfilled and came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. -- daniel 4:28
.
At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. -- daniel 4:29
.
The king said, Is not this the great Babylon that I have built as the royal residence and seat of government by the might of my power and for the honor and glory of my majesty? -- daniel 4:30
.
While the words were still in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you, -- daniel 4:31
.
And you shall be driven from among men and your dwelling will be with the living creatures of the field. You will be made to eat grass like the oxen, and seven times [or years] shall pass over you until you have learned and know that the Most High [God] rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He will. -- daniel 4:32
.
That very hour the thing was [in process of] being fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and did eat grass like oxen [as Daniel had said he would], and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens until his hair grew like eagles' [feathers] and his nails [were] like birds' [claws]. -- daniel 4:33
.
And at the end of the days [seven years], I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding and the right use of my mind returned to me; and I blessed the Most High [God] and I praised and honored and glorified Him Who lives forever, Whose dominion is an everlasting dominion; and His kingdom endures from generation to generation. -- daniel 4:34
.
And all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing. And He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can stay His hand or say to Him, What are You doing? -- daniel 4:35
.
Now at the same time my reason and understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me, and my counselors and my lords sought me out; I was reestablished in my kingdom, and still more greatness [than before] was added to me. -- daniel 4:36
.
Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, Whose works are all faithful and right and Whose ways are just. And those who walk in pride He is able to abase and humble. -- daniel 4:37
.
BELSHAZZAR THE king [descendant of Nebuchadnezzar] made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and he drank his wine in the presence of the thousand. -- daniel 5:1
.
Belshazzar, while he was tasting the wine, commanded that the gold and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple [out of the sacred area--the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies] which was in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them. -- daniel 5:2
.
Then they brought in the gold and silver vessels which had been taken out of the temple, the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them. -- daniel 5:3
.
They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone. -- daniel 5:4
.
Immediately and suddenly there appeared the fingers of a man's hand and wrote on the plaster of the wall opposite the candlestick [so exposed especially to the light] in the king's palace, and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. -- daniel 5:5
.
Then the color and the [drunken] hilarious brightness of the king's face was changed, and his [terrifying] thoughts troubled and alarmed him; the joints and muscles of his hips and back gave way and his knees smote together. -- daniel 5:6
.
The king cried aloud [mightily] to bring in the enchanters or soothsayers, the Chaldeans [diviners], and the astrologers. The king said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever will read this writing and show me the interpretation of it will be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold put about his neck and will be the third ruler in the kingdom. -- daniel 5:7
.
And all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation of it. -- daniel 5:8
.
Then King Belshazzar was greatly perplexed and alarmed and the color faded from his face, and his lords were puzzled and astounded. -- daniel 5:9
.
Now the queen [mother], overhearing the exciting words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house. The queen [mother] said, O king, live forever! Do not be alarmed at your thoughts or let your cheerful expression and the color of your face be changed. -- daniel 5:10
.
There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the holy God [or gods], and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him; and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father--the king, I say, your father--appointed him master of the magicians, enchanters or soothsayers, Chaldeans, and astrologers, -- daniel 5:11
.
Because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, clarify riddles, and solve knotty problems were found in this same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation. -- daniel 5:12
.
Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king said to Daniel, Are you that Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? -- daniel 5:13
.
I have heard of you, that the Spirit of the holy God [or gods] is in you and that light and understanding and superior wisdom are found in you. -- daniel 5:14
.
Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me that they might read this writing and make known to me the interpretation of it, but they could not show the interpretation of the matter. -- daniel 5:15
.
But I have heard of you, that you can make interpretations and solve knotty problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold put around your neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. -- daniel 5:16
.
Then Daniel answered before the king, Let your gifts be for yourself and give your rewards to another. However, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation. -- daniel 5:17
.
O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom and greatness and glory and majesty; -- daniel 5:18
.
And because of the greatness that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he set up, and whom he would he put down. -- daniel 5:19
.
But when his heart was lifted up and his mind and spirit were hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne and his glory was taken from him; -- daniel 5:20
.
He was driven from among men, and his heart or mind was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens until he learned and knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men and that He appoints and sets over it whomever He will. -- daniel 5:21
.
And you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart and mind, though you knew all this [knew it and were defiant]. -- daniel 5:22
.
And you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of His house have been brought before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know; but the God in Whose hand your breath is and Whose are all your ways you have not honored and glorified [but have dishonored and disgraced]. -- daniel 5:23
.
Then was the part of the hand sent from the presence of [the Most High God], and this writing was inscribed. -- daniel 5:24
.
And this is the inscription that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN--numbered, numbered, weighed, divisions. -- daniel 5:25
.
This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingship and brought them to an end; -- daniel 5:26
.
TEKEL, You are weighed in the balances and are found wanting; -- daniel 5:27
.
PERES, Your kingdom and your kingship are divided and given to the Medes and Persians. [Foretold in Isa. 21:2, 5, 9.] -- daniel 5:28
.
Then Belshazzar commanded, and Daniel was clothed with purple and a chain of gold put about his neck, and a proclamation was made concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. -- daniel 5:29
.
During that night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was slain, -- daniel 5:30
.
And Darius the Mede took the kingdom; he was about sixty-two years old. -- daniel 5:31
.
IT PLEASED [King] Darius [successor to Belshazzar] to set over the kingdom satraps who should be [in charge] throughout all the kingdom, -- daniel 6:1
.
And over them three presidents--of whom Daniel was one--that these satraps might give account to them and that the king should have no loss or damage. -- daniel 6:2
.
Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps because an excellent spirit was in him, and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. -- daniel 6:3
.
Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion [to bring accusation] against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no occasion or fault, for he was faithful, nor was there any error or fault found in him. -- daniel 6:4
.
Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion [to bring accusation] against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God. -- daniel 6:5
.
Then these presidents and satraps came [tumultuously] together to the king and said to him, King Darius, live forever! -- daniel 6:6
.
All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have consulted and agreed that the king should establish a royal statute and make a firm decree that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. -- daniel 6:7
.
Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be altered. -- daniel 6:8
.
So King Darius signed the writing and the decree. -- daniel 6:9
.
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house, and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he got down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. -- daniel 6:10
.
Then these men came thronging [by agreement] and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. -- daniel 6:11
.
Then they came near and said before the king concerning his prohibitory decree, Have you not signed an edict that any man who shall make a petition to any god or man within thirty days, except of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed or repealed. -- daniel 6:12
.
Then they said before the king, That Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, does not regard or pay any attention to you, O king, or to the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day. -- daniel 6:13
.
Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed [over what he had done] and set his mind on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored until the sun went down to rescue him. -- daniel 6:14
.
Then these same men came thronging [by agreement] to the king and said, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed or repealed. -- daniel 6:15
.
Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, May your God, Whom you are serving continually, deliver you! -- daniel 6:16
.
And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that there might be no change of purpose concerning Daniel. -- daniel 6:17
.
Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting, neither were instruments of music or dancing girls brought before him; and his sleep fled from him. -- daniel 6:18
.
Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. -- daniel 6:19
.
And when he came to the den and to Daniel, he cried out in a voice of anguish. The king said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, Whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions? -- daniel 6:20
.
Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever! -- daniel 6:21
.
My God has sent His angel and has shut the lions' mouths so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent and blameless before Him; and also before you, O king, [as you very well know] I have done no harm or wrong. -- daniel 6:22
.
Then the king was exceedingly glad and commanded that Daniel should be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no hurt of any kind was found on him because he believed in (relied on, adhered to, and trusted in) his God. -- daniel 6:23
.
And the king commanded, and those men who had accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions, they, their children, and their wives; and before they ever reached the bottom of the den, the lions had overpowered them and had broken their bones in pieces. -- daniel 6:24
.
Then King Darius wrote to all peoples, nations, and languages [in his realm] that dwelt in all the earth: May peace be multiplied to you! -- daniel 6:25
.
I make a decree that in all my royal dominion men must tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for He is the living God, enduring and steadfast forever, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed and His dominion shall be even to the end [of the world]. -- daniel 6:26
.
He is a Savior and Deliverer, and He works signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth--He Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. -- daniel 6:27
.
So this [man] Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. -- daniel 6:28
.
IN THE first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions in his head as he was lying upon his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the gist of the matter. -- daniel 7:1
.
Daniel said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens [political and social agitations] were stirring up the great sea [the nations of the world]. -- daniel 7:2
.
And four great beasts came up out of the sea in succession, and different from one another. -- daniel 7:3
.
The first [the Babylonian empire under Nebuchadnezzar] was like a lion and had eagle's wings. I looked till the wings of it were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. -- daniel 7:4
.
And behold another beast, a second one [the Medo-Persian empire], was like a bear, and it raised up itself on one side [or one dominion] and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, Arise, devour much flesh. -- daniel 7:5
.
After this I looked, and behold, another [the Grecian empire of Alexander the Great], like a leopard which had four wings of a bird on its back. The beast had also four heads [Alexander's generals, his successors], and dominion was given to it. -- daniel 7:6
.
After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast [the Roman empire]--terrible, powerful and dreadful, and exceedingly strong. And it had great iron teeth; it devoured and crushed and trampled what was left with its feet. And it was different from all the beasts that came before it, and it had ten horns [symbolizing ten kings]. -- daniel 7:7
.
I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things. -- daniel 7:8
.
I kept looking until thrones were placed [for the assessors with the Judge], and the Ancient of Days [God, the eternal Father] took His seat, Whose garment was white as snow and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was like the fiery flame; its wheels were burning fire. -- daniel 7:9
.
A stream of fire came forth from before Him; a thousand thousands ministered to Him and ten thousand times ten thousand rose up and stood before Him; the Judge was seated [the court was in session] and the books were opened. -- daniel 7:10
.
I looked then because of the sound of the great words which the horn was speaking. I watched until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. -- daniel 7:11
.
And as for the rest of the beasts, their power of dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged [for the duration of their lives was fixed] for a season and a time. -- daniel 7:12
.
I saw in the night visions, and behold, on the clouds of the heavens came One like a Son of man, and He came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him. -- daniel 7:13
.
And there was given Him [the Messiah] dominion and glory and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and His kingdom is one which shall not be destroyed. -- daniel 7:14
.
As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved and anxious within me, and the visions of my head alarmed and agitated me. -- daniel 7:15
.
I came near to one of those who stood there and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things. -- daniel 7:16
.
These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth. -- daniel 7:17
.
But the saints of the Most High [God] shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever. -- daniel 7:18
.
Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast--which was different from all the others, exceedingly terrible and shocking, whose teeth were of iron and its nails of bronze, which devoured, broke and crushed, and trampled what was left with its feet-- -- daniel 7:19
.
And about the ten horns [representing kings] that were on its head, and the other horn which came up later and before which three of [the horns] fell, the horn which had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things and which looked greater than the others. -- daniel 7:20
.
As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them -- daniel 7:21
.
Until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High [God], and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom. -- daniel 7:22
.
Thus [the angel] said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all other kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth, tread it down, and break it in pieces and crush it. -- daniel 7:23
.
And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise; and another shall arise after them, and he shall be different from the former ones, and he shall subdue and put down three kings. -- daniel 7:24
.
And he shall speak words against the Most High [God] and shall wear out the saints of the Most High and think to change the time [of sacred feasts and holy days] and the law; and the saints shall be given into his hand for a time, two times, and half a time [three and one-half years]. -- daniel 7:25
.
But the judgment shall be set [by the court of the Most High], and they shall take away his dominion to consume it [gradually] and to destroy it [suddenly] in the end. -- daniel 7:26
.
And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heavens shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions shall serve and obey Him. -- daniel 7:27
.
Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my [waking] thoughts troubled and alarmed me much and my cheerfulness of countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter [of the interpreting angel's information] in my heart and mind. -- daniel 7:28
.
IN THE third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that appeared to me at the first. -- daniel 8:1
.
And I saw in the vision and it seemed that I was at Shushan the palace or fortress [in Susa, the capital of Persia], which is in the province of Elam, and I saw in the vision and I was by the river of Ulai. -- daniel 8:2
.
And I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a [single] ram which had two horns [representing two kings of Medo-Persia: Darius the Mede, then Cyrus]; and the two horns were high, but one [Persia] was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last. -- daniel 8:3
.
I looked and saw the ram [Medo-Persia] pushing and charging westward and northward and southward; no beast could stand before him, neither could anyone rescue from his power, but he did according to his [own] will and pleasure and magnified himself. -- daniel 8:4
.
As I was considering, behold, a he-goat [the king of Greece] came from the west across the face of the whole earth without touching the ground, and the goat had a conspicuous and remarkable horn between his eyes [symbolizing Alexander the Great]. -- daniel 8:5
.
And he came to the ram that had the two horns which I had seen standing on the bank of the river and ran at him in the heat of his power. -- daniel 8:6
.
[In my vision] I saw him come close to the ram [Medo-Persia], and he was moved with anger against him and he [Alexander the Great] struck the ram and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but the goat threw him to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. -- daniel 8:7
.
And the he-goat [Alexander the Great] magnified himself exceedingly, and when he was [young and] strong, the great horn [he] was [suddenly] broken; and instead of [him] there came up four notable horns [to whom the kingdom was divided, one] toward [each of] the four winds of the heavens. -- daniel 8:8
.
Out of littleness and small beginnings one of them came forth [Antiochus Epiphanes], a horn whose [impious presumption and pride] grew exceedingly great toward the south and toward the east and toward the ornament [the precious, blessed land of Israel]. -- daniel 8:9
.
And [in my vision this horn] grew great, even against the host of heaven [God's true people, the saints], and some of the host and of the stars [priests] it cast down to the ground and trampled on them, -- daniel 8:10
.
Yes, [this horn] magnified itself, even [matching itself] against the Prince of the host [of heaven]; and from Him the continual [burnt offering] was taken away and the place of [God's] sanctuary was cast down and profaned. -- daniel 8:11
.
And the host [the chosen people] was given [to the wicked horn] together with the continual burnt offering because of the transgression [of God's people--their abounding irreverence, ungodliness, and lack of piety]. And righteousness and truth were cast down to the ground, and it [the wicked horn] accomplished this [by divine permission] and prospered. -- daniel 8:12
.
Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one that spoke, For how long is the vision concerning the continual offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of both the sanctuary and the host [of the people] to be trampled underfoot? -- daniel 8:13
.
And he said to him and to me, For 2,evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed and restored. -- daniel 8:14
.
When I, even I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; then behold, there stood before me one [Gabriel] with the appearance of a man. -- daniel 8:15
.
And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the [river] Ulai which called and said, Gabriel, make this man [Daniel] understand the vision. -- daniel 8:16
.
So he came near where I stood, and when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, Understand, O son of man, for the [fulfillment of the] vision belongs to [events that shall occur in] the time of the end. -- daniel 8:17
.
Now as he [Gabriel] was speaking with me, I fell stunned and in deep unconsciousness with my face to the ground; but he touched me and set me upright [where I had stood]. -- daniel 8:18
.
And he said, Behold, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation [of God upon the ungodly], for it has to do with the time of the end. -- daniel 8:19
.
The ram you saw having two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. -- daniel 8:20
.
And the shaggy and rough he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between his eyes is the first king [who consolidated the whole realm, Alexander the Great]. -- daniel 8:21
.
And as for the horn which was shattered, in whose place four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise out of his nation but not having his [Alexander's] power. -- daniel 8:22
.
And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors [the apostate Jews] have reached the fullness [of their wickedness, taxing the limits of God's mercy], a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark trickery and craftiness shall stand up. -- daniel 8:23
.
And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall corrupt and destroy astonishingly and shall prosper and do his own pleasure, and he shall corrupt and destroy the mighty men and the holy people (the people of the saints). -- daniel 8:24
.
And through his policy he shall cause trickery to prosper in his hand; he shall magnify himself in his heart and mind, and in their security he will corrupt and destroy many. He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes, but he shall be broken and that by no [human] hand. -- daniel 8:25
.
The vision of the evenings and the mornings which has been told you is true. But seal up the vision, for it has to do with and belongs to the [now] distant future. -- daniel 8:26
.
And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick [for several] days. Afterward I rose up and did the king's business; and I wondered at the vision, but there was no one who understood it or could make it understood. -- daniel 8:27
.
IN THE first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, of the offspring of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans-- -- daniel 9:1
.
In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the books the number of years which, according to the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass by before the desolations [which had been] pronounced on Jerusalem should end; and it was seventy years. -- daniel 9:2
.
And I set my face to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes; -- daniel 9:3
.
And I prayed to the Lord my God and made confession and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, Who keeps covenant, mercy, and loving-kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments, -- daniel 9:4
.
We have sinned and dealt perversely and done wickedly and have rebelled, turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances. -- daniel 9:5
.
Neither have we listened to and heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. -- daniel 9:6
.
O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us confusion and shame of face, as at this day--to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to those who are near and those who are far off, through all the countries to which You have driven them because of the [treacherous] trespass which they have committed against You. -- daniel 9:7
.
O Lord, to us belong confusion and shame of face--to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers--because we have sinned against You. -- daniel 9:8
.
To the Lord our God belong mercy and loving-kindness and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him; -- daniel 9:9
.
And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by walking in His laws which He set before us through His servants the prophets. -- daniel 9:10
.
Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, even turning aside that they might not obey Your voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out on us and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him. -- daniel 9:11
.
And He has carried out intact His [threatening] words which He threatened against us and against our judges [the kings, princes, and rulers generally] who ruled us, and He has brought upon us a great evil; for under the whole heavens there has not been done before [anything so dreadful] as [He has caused to be] done against Jerusalem. -- daniel 9:12
.
Just as it is written in the Law of Moses as to all this evil [that would surely come upon transgressors], so it has come upon us. Yet we have not earnestly begged for forgiveness and entreated the favor of the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and have understanding and become wise in Your truth. -- daniel 9:13
.
Therefore the Lord has kept ready the calamity (evil) and has brought it upon us, for the Lord our God is [uncompromisingly] righteous and rigidly just in all His works which He does [keeping His word]; and we have not obeyed His voice. -- daniel 9:14
.
And now, O Lord our God, Who brought Your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and secured Yourself renown and a name as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly! -- daniel 9:15
.
O Lord, according to all Your rightness and justice, I beseech You, let Your anger and Your wrath be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain. Because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach and a byword to all who are around about us. -- daniel 9:16
.
Now therefore, O our God, listen to and heed the prayer of Your servant [Daniel] and his supplications, and for Your own sake cause Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary which is desolate. -- daniel 9:17
.
O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and look at our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications before You for our own righteousness and justice, but for Your great mercy and loving-kindness. -- daniel 9:18
.
O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, give heed and act! Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name. -- daniel 9:19
.
While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy hill of my God-- -- daniel 9:20
.
Yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the former vision, being caused to fly swiftly, came near to me and touched me about the time of the evening sacrifice. -- daniel 9:21
.
He instructed me and made me understand; he talked with me and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give you skill and wisdom and understanding. -- daniel 9:22
.
At the beginning of your prayers, the word [giving an answer] went forth, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision. -- daniel 9:23
.
Seventy weeks [of years, or years] are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city [Jerusalem], to finish and put an end to transgression, to seal up and make full the measure of sin, to purge away and make expiation and reconciliation for sin, to bring in everlasting righteousness (permanent moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation) to seal up vision and prophecy and prophet, and to anoint a Holy of Holies. -- daniel 9:24
.
Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until [the coming of] the Anointed One, a Prince, shall be seven weeks [of years] and sixty-two weeks [of years]; it shall be built again with [city] square and moat, but in troublous times. -- daniel 9:25
.
And after the sixty-two weeks [of years] shall the Anointed One be cut off or killed and shall have nothing [and no one] belonging to [and defending] Him. And the people of the [other] prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood; and even to the end there shall be war, and desolations are decreed. -- daniel 9:26
.
And he shall enter into a strong and firm covenant with the many for one week [seven years]. And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and offering to cease [for the remaining three and one-half years]; and upon the wing or pinnacle of abominations [shall come] one who makes desolate, until the full determined end is poured out on the desolator. -- daniel 9:27
.
IN THE third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar. And the word was true and it referred to great tribulation (conflict and wretchedness). And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision. -- daniel 10:1
.
In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three whole weeks. -- daniel 10:2
.
I ate no pleasant or desirable food, nor did any meat or wine come into my mouth; and I did not anoint myself at all for the full three weeks. -- daniel 10:3
.
On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was on the bank of the great river Hiddekel [which is the Tigris], -- daniel 10:4
.
I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz. -- daniel 10:5
.
His body also was [a golden luster] like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and his feet like glowing burnished bronze, and the sound of his words was like the noise of a multitude [of people or the roaring of the sea]. -- daniel 10:6
.
And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision [of this heavenly being], for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves. -- daniel 10:7
.
So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me, for my fresh appearance was turned to pallor; I grew weak and faint [with fright]. -- daniel 10:8
.
Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in a deep sleep, with my face [sunk] to the ground. -- daniel 10:9
.
And behold, a hand touched me, which set me [unsteadily] upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. -- daniel 10:10
.
And [the angel] said to me, O Daniel, you greatly beloved man, understand the words that I speak to you and stand upright, for to you I am now sent. And while he was saying this word to me, I stood up trembling. -- daniel 10:11
.
Then he said to me, Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your mind and heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come as a consequence of [and in response to] your words. -- daniel 10:12
.
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief [of the celestial] princes, came to help me, for I remained there with the kings of Persia. -- daniel 10:13
.
Now I have come to make you understand what is to befall your people in the latter days, for the vision is for [many] days yet to come. -- daniel 10:14
.
When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was dumb. -- daniel 10:15
.
And behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision sorrows and pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. -- daniel 10:16
.
For how can my lord's servant [who is so feeble] talk with this my lord? For now no strength remains in me, nor is there any breath left in me. -- daniel 10:17
.
Then there touched me again one whose appearance was like that of a man, and he strengthened me. -- daniel 10:18
.
And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not! Peace be to you! Be strong, yes, be strong. And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened and said, Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me. -- daniel 10:19
.
Then he said, Do you know why I have come to you? And now I will return to fight with the [hostile] prince of Persia; and when I have gone, behold, the [hostile] prince of Greece will come. -- daniel 10:20
.
But I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth or the Book of Truth. There is no one who holds with me and strengthens himself against these [hostile spirit forces] except Michael, your prince [national guardian angel]. -- daniel 10:21
.
ALSO I [the angel], in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood up to confirm and to strengthen him [Michael, the angelic prince]. -- daniel 11:1
.
And now I will show you the truth. Behold, there shall arise three more kings in Persia, and a fourth shall be far richer than they all. And when he has become strong through his riches he shall stir up and stake all against the realm of Greece. -- daniel 11:2
.
Then a mighty [warlike, threatening] king shall arise who shall rule with great dominion and do according to his [own] will. -- daniel 11:3
.
And as soon as he has fully arisen, his [Alexander the Great's] kingdom shall be broken [by his death] and divided toward the four winds [the east, west, north, and south] of the heavens, but not to his posterity, nor according to the [Grecian] dominion which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be torn out and uprooted and go to others [to his four generals] to the exclusion of these. -- daniel 11:4
.
Then the king of the South (Egypt) shall be strong, but one of his princes shall be stronger than he is and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion. -- daniel 11:5
.
At the end of some years they [the king of the North, Syria, and the king of the South, Egypt] shall make an alliance; the daughter of the king of the South shall come to the king of the North to make [a just and peaceful marriage] agreement; but she shall not retain the power of her might, neither shall he and his might endure. She shall be handed over with her attendants, her child, and him who strengthened her in those times. -- daniel 11:6
.
But out of a branch of the [same ancestral] roots as hers shall one [her brother] stand up in his place or office, who shall come against the [Syrian] army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the North and shall deal against them and shall prevail. -- daniel 11:7
.
And also he shall carry off to Egypt their [Syria's] gods with their molten images and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold, and he shall refrain for some years from [waging war against] the king of the North. -- daniel 11:8
.
And he [the king of Syria] shall come into the kingdom of the king of the South but shall return to his own land. -- daniel 11:9
.
But his sons shall be stirred up and shall prepare for war and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on and overflow and pass through and again shall make war even to the fortress [of the king of the South]. -- daniel 11:10
.
And the king of the South (Egypt) shall be moved with anger and shall come forth and fight with the king of the North (Syria); and he [the Syrian king] shall set forth a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his [the Egyptian king's] hand. -- daniel 11:11
.
When the multitude is taken and carried away, the heart and mind [of the Egyptian king] shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail. -- daniel 11:12
.
For the king of the North shall raise a multitude greater than [he had] before, and after some years shall certainly return, coming with a great army and much substance and equipment. -- daniel 11:13
.
In those times many shall rise up against the king of the South (Egypt); also the men of violence among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the visions [of Dan. and 9], but they shall fail and fall. -- daniel 11:14
.
Then the king of the North shall come and cast up siege works and take a well-fortified city, and the forces of the South shall not stand, or even his chosen troops, for there shall be no strength to stand [against the Syrian king]. -- daniel 11:15
.
But he [Antiochus the Great] who comes against him [from Syria] shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; he shall stand in the glorious land [of Israel], and in his hand shall be destruction and all the land shall be in his power. -- daniel 11:16
.
He [Antiochus the Great] shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him upright conditions and terms of peace, and he shall perform them [by making an agreement with the king of the South]. He shall give him [his] daughter to corrupt and destroy it [his league with Egypt] and the kingdom, but it shall not succeed or be to his advantage. -- daniel 11:17
.
After this he shall turn his attention to the islands and coastlands and shall take over many of them. But a prince or commander shall teach him [Antiochus the Great] to put an end to the insults offered by him; in fact he shall turn his insolence and reproaches back upon him. -- daniel 11:18
.
Then he shall turn his face back toward the fortresses of his own land [of Syria], but he shall stumble and fall and not be found. -- daniel 11:19
.
Then shall stand up in his place or office one who shall send an exactor of tribute to pass through the glory of the kingdom, but within a few days he shall be destroyed, [yet] neither in anger nor in battle. -- daniel 11:20
.
And in his place or office [in Syria] shall arise a contemptuous and contemptible person, to whom royal majesty and honor of the kingdom have not been given. But he shall come in without warning in time of security and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries, intrigues, and cunning hypocritical conduct. -- daniel 11:21
.
Before him the overwhelming forces of invading armies shall be broken and utterly swept away; yes, and a prince of the covenant [with those who were at peace with him] also [shall be broken and swept away]. -- daniel 11:22
.
And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall work deceitfully, and he shall come up unexpectedly and shall become strong with a small people. -- daniel 11:23
.
Without warning and stealthily he shall come into the most productive places of a province or among the richest men of a province [of Egypt], and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor his fathers' fathers; he shall distribute among them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds--but only for a time [the period decreed by God]. -- daniel 11:24
.
And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South [Egypt] with a great army; and the king of the South shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army, but he shall not stand, for schemes shall be devised against [the king of the South]. -- daniel 11:25
.
Yes, those who eat of his rich and dainty food shall break and destroy him, and his army shall drift or turn away to flee, and many shall fall down slain. -- daniel 11:26
.
And as for both of these kings, their hearts and minds shall be set on doing mischief; they shall speak lies over the same table, but it will not succeed, for the end is yet to be at the time appointed. -- daniel 11:27
.
Then shall [the vile conqueror from the North] return into his land with much booty; and his heart and purpose shall be set against [God's] holy covenant [with His people], and he shall accomplish [his malicious intention] and return to his own land [Syria]. -- daniel 11:28
.
At the time appointed [God's own time] he shall return and come into the South, but it shall not be successful as were the former invasions [of Egypt]. -- daniel 11:29
.
For the ships of Kittim [or Cyprus, in Roman hands] shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved and discouraged and turn back [to Palestine] and carry out his rage and indignation against the holy covenant and God's people, and he shall do his own pleasure; he shall even turn back and make common cause with those [Jews] who abandon the holy covenant [with God]. -- daniel 11:30
.
And armed forces of his shall appear [in the holy land] and they shall pollute the sanctuary, the [spiritual] stronghold, and shall take away the continual [daily burnt offering]; and they shall set up [in the sanctuary] the abomination that astonishes and makes desolate [probably an altar to a pagan god]. -- daniel 11:31
.
And such as violate the covenant he shall pervert and seduce with flatteries, but the people who know their God shall prove themselves strong and shall stand firm and do exploits [for God]. -- daniel 11:32
.
And they who are wise and understanding among the people shall instruct many and make them understand, though some [of them and their followers] shall fall by the sword and flame, by captivity and plunder, for many days. -- daniel 11:33
.
Now when they fall, they shall receive a little help. Many shall join themselves to them with flatteries and hypocrisies. -- daniel 11:34
.
And some of those who are wise, prudent, and understanding shall be weakened and fall, [thus, then, the insincere among the people will lose courage and become deserters. It will be a test] to refine, to purify, and to make those among [God's people] white, even to the time of the end, because it is yet for the time [God] appointed. -- daniel 11:35
.
And the king shall do according to his will; he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished, for that which is determined [by God] shall be done. -- daniel 11:36
.
He shall not regard the gods of his fathers or Him [to Whom] women desire [to give birth--the Messiah] or any other god, for he shall magnify himself above all. -- daniel 11:37
.
But in their place he shall honor the god of fortresses; a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold and silver, with precious stones, and with pleasant and expensive things. -- daniel 11:38
.
And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. Those who acknowledge him he shall magnify with glory and honor, and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for a price. -- daniel 11:39
.
And at the time of the end the king of the South shall push at and attack him, and the king of the North shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots and horsemen and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass through. -- daniel 11:40
.
He shall enter into the Glorious Land [Palestine] and many shall be overthrown, but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, Moab, and the main [core] of the people of Ammon. -- daniel 11:41
.
He shall stretch out his hand also against the [other] countries, but the land of Egypt shall not be among the escaped ones. -- daniel 11:42
.
But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of Egypt, and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall accompany him [compelled to follow his steps]. -- daniel 11:43
.
But rumors from the east and from the north shall alarm and hasten him. And he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many. -- daniel 11:44
.
And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the seas and the glorious holy Mount [Zion]; yet he shall come to his end with none to help him. -- daniel 11:45
.
AND AT that time [of the end] Michael shall arise, the great [angelic] prince who defends and has charge of your [Daniel's] people. And there shall be a time of trouble, straitness, and distress such as never was since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the Book [of God's plan for His own]. -- daniel 12:1
.
And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake: some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and abhorrence. -- daniel 12:2
.
And the teachers and those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament, and those who turn many to righteousness (to uprightness and right standing with God) [shall give forth light] like the stars forever and ever. -- daniel 12:3
.
But you, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the Book until the time of the end. [Then] many shall run to and fro and search anxiously [through the Book], and knowledge [of God's purposes as revealed by His prophets] shall be increased and become great. -- daniel 12:4
.
Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, there stood two others, the one on the brink of the river on this side and the other on the brink of the river on that side. -- daniel 12:5
.
And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? -- daniel 12:6
.
And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right and his left hand toward the heavens and swore by Him Who lives forever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half a time [or three and one-half years]; and when they have made an end of shattering and crushing the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. -- daniel 12:7
.
And I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, O my lord, what shall be the issue and final end of these things? -- daniel 12:8
.
And he [the angel] said, Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end. -- daniel 12:9
.
Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be tried, smelted, and refined, but the wicked shall do wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the teachers and those who are wise shall understand. -- daniel 12:10
.
And from the time that the continual burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be 1,days. -- daniel 12:11
.
Blessed, happy, fortunate, spiritually prosperous, and to be envied is he who waits expectantly and earnestly [who endures without wavering beyond the period of tribulation] and comes to the 1,days! -- daniel 12:12
.
But you [Daniel, who was now over ninety years of age], go your way until the end; for you shall rest and shall stand [fast] in your allotted place at the end of the days. -- daniel 12:13
.
THE BOOK of the ancestry (genealogy) of Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), the son (descendant) of David, the son (descendant) of Abraham. -- matthew 1:1
.
Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, -- matthew 1:2
.
Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Aram, -- matthew 1:3
.
Aram the father of Aminadab, Aminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, -- matthew 1:4
.
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse, -- matthew 1:5
.
Jesse the father of King David, King David the father of Solomon, whose mother had been the wife of Uriah, -- matthew 1:6
.
Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa, -- matthew 1:7
.
Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram [Jehoram], Joram the father of Uzziah, -- matthew 1:8
.
Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, -- matthew 1:9
.
Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah, -- matthew 1:10
.
And Josiah became the father of Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] and his brothers about the time of the removal (deportation) to Babylon. [II Kings 24:14; I Chron. 3:15, 16.] -- matthew 1:11
.
After the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel [Salathiel], Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, -- matthew 1:12
.
Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor, -- matthew 1:13
.
Azor the father of Sadoc, Sadoc the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud, -- matthew 1:14
.
Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob, -- matthew 1:15
.
Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, Who is called the Christ. (the Messiah, the Anointed) -- matthew 1:16
.
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen, from David to the Babylonian exile (deportation) fourteen generations, from the Babylonian exile to the Christ fourteen generations. -- matthew 1:17
.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place under these circumstances: When His mother Mary had been promised in marriage to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be pregnant [through the power] of the Holy Spirit. -- matthew 1:18
.
And her [promised] husband Joseph, being a just and upright man and not willing to expose her publicly and to shame and disgrace her, decided to repudiate and dismiss (divorce) her quietly and secretly. -- matthew 1:19
.
But as he was thinking this over, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, descendant of David, do not be afraid to take Mary [as] your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of (from, out of) the Holy Spirit. -- matthew 1:20
.
She will bear a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus [the Greek form of the Hebrew Joshua, which means Savior], for He will save His people from their sins [that is, prevent them from failing and missing the true end and scope of life, which is God]. -- matthew 1:21
.
All this took place that it might be fulfilled which the Lord had spoken through the prophet, -- matthew 1:22
.
Behold, the virgin shall become pregnant and give birth to a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel--which, when translated, means, God with us. -- matthew 1:23
.
Then Joseph, being aroused from his sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him: he took [her to his side as] his wife. -- matthew 1:24
.
But he had no union with her as her husband until she had borne her firstborn Son; and he called His name Jesus. -- matthew 1:25
.
NOW WHEN Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men [astrologers] from the east came to Jerusalem, asking, -- matthew 2:1
.
Where is He Who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east at its rising and have come to worship Him. -- matthew 2:2
.
When Herod the king heard this, he was disturbed and troubled, and the whole of Jerusalem with him. -- matthew 2:3
.
So he called together all the chief priests and learned men (scribes) of the people and anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born. -- matthew 2:4
.
They replied to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: -- matthew 2:5
.
And you Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are not in any way least or insignificant among the chief cities of Judah; for from you shall come a Ruler (Leader) Who will govern and shepherd My people Israel. -- matthew 2:6
.
Then Herod sent for the wise men [astrologers] secretly, and accurately to the last point ascertained from them the time of the appearing of the star [that is, how long the star had made itself visible since its rising in the east]. -- matthew 2:7
.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, Go and search for the Child carefully and diligently, and when you have found Him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship Him. -- matthew 2:8
.
When they had listened to the king, they went their way, and behold, the star which had been seen in the east in its rising went before them until it came and stood over the place where the young Child was. -- matthew 2:9
.
When they saw the star, they were thrilled with ecstatic joy. -- matthew 2:10
.
And on going into the house, they saw the Child with Mary His mother, and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then opening their treasure bags, they presented to Him gifts--gold and frankincense and myrrh. -- matthew 2:11
.
And receiving an answer to their asking, they were divinely instructed and warned in a dream not to go back to Herod; so they departed to their own country by a different way. -- matthew 2:12
.
Now after they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Get up! [Tenderly] take unto you the young Child and His mother and flee to Egypt; and remain there till I tell you [otherwise], for Herod intends to search for the Child in order to destroy Him. -- matthew 2:13
.
And having risen, he took the Child and His mother by night and withdrew to Egypt -- matthew 2:14
.
And remained there until Herod's death. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, Out of Egypt have I called My Son. -- matthew 2:15
.
Then Herod, when he realized that he had been misled by the wise men, was furiously enraged, and he sent and put to death all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that territory who were two years old and under, reckoning according to the date which he had investigated diligently and had learned exactly from the wise men. -- matthew 2:16
.
Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: -- matthew 2:17
.
A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they were no more. -- matthew 2:18
.
But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt -- matthew 2:19
.
And said, Rise, [tenderly] take unto you the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the Child's life are dead. -- matthew 2:20
.
Then he awoke and arose and [tenderly] took the Child and His mother and came into the land of Israel. -- matthew 2:21
.
But because he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee. -- matthew 2:22
.
He went and dwelt in a town called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled: He shall be called a Nazarene [Branch, Separated One]. -- matthew 2:23
.
IN THOSE days there appeared John the Baptist, preaching in the Wilderness (Desert) of Judea -- matthew 3:1
.
And saying, Repent (think differently; change your mind, regretting your sins and changing your conduct), for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. -- matthew 3:2
.
This is he who was mentioned by the prophet Isaiah when he said, The voice of one crying in the wilderness (shouting in the desert), Prepare the road for the Lord, make His highways straight (level, direct). -- matthew 3:3
.
This same John's garments were made of camel's hair, and he wore a leather girdle about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. -- matthew 3:4
.
Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country round about the Jordan went out to him; -- matthew 3:5
.
And they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins. -- matthew 3:6
.
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee and escape from the wrath and indignation [of God against disobedience] that is coming? -- matthew 3:7
.
Bring forth fruit that is consistent with repentance [let your lives prove your change of heart]; -- matthew 3:8
.
And do not presume to say to yourselves, We have Abraham for our forefather; for I tell you, God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones! -- matthew 3:9
.
And already the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. -- matthew 3:10
.
I indeed baptize you in (with) water because of repentance [that is, because of your changing your minds for the better, heartily amending your ways, with abhorrence of your past sins]. But He Who is coming after me is mightier than I, Whose sandals I am not worthy or fit to take off or carry; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. -- matthew 3:11
.
His winnowing fan (shovel, fork) is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear out and clean His threshing floor and gather and store His wheat in His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with fire that cannot be put out. -- matthew 3:12
.
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him. -- matthew 3:13
.
But John protested strenuously, having in mind to prevent Him, saying, It is I who have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me? -- matthew 3:14
.
But Jesus replied to him, Permit it just now; for this is the fitting way for [both of] us to fulfill all righteousness [that is, to perform completely whatever is right]. Then he permitted Him. -- matthew 3:15
.
And when Jesus was baptized, He went up at once out of the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he [John] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on Him. -- matthew 3:16
.
And behold, a voice from heaven said, This is My Son, My Beloved, in Whom I delight! -- matthew 3:17
.
THEN JESUS was led (guided) by the [Holy] Spirit into the wilderness (desert) to be tempted (tested and tried) by the devil. -- matthew 4:1
.
And He went without food for forty days and forty nights, and later He was hungry. -- matthew 4:2
.
And the tempter came and said to Him, If You are God's Son, command these stones to be made [loaves of] bread. -- matthew 4:3
.
But He replied, It has been written, Man shall not live and be upheld and sustained by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God. -- matthew 4:4
.
Then the devil took Him into the holy city and placed Him on a turret (pinnacle, gable) of the temple sanctuary. -- matthew 4:5
.
And he said to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written, He will give His angels charge over you, and they will bear you up on their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone. -- matthew 4:6
.
Jesus said to him, On the other hand, it is written also, You shall not tempt, test thoroughly, or try exceedingly the Lord your God. -- matthew 4:7
.
Again, the devil took Him up on a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory (the splendor, magnificence, preeminence, and excellence) of them. -- matthew 4:8
.
And he said to Him, These things, all taken together, I will give You, if You will prostrate Yourself before me and do homage and worship me. -- matthew 4:9
.
Then Jesus said to him, Begone, Satan! For it has been written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone shall you serve. -- matthew 4:10
.
Then the devil departed from Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him. -- matthew 4:11
.
Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested and put in prison, He withdrew into Galilee. -- matthew 4:12
.
And leaving Nazareth, He went and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea, in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali-- -- matthew 4:13
.
That what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be brought to pass: -- matthew 4:14
.
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, in the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles [of the peoples who are not of Israel]-- -- matthew 4:15
.
The people who sat (dwelt enveloped) in darkness have seen a great Light, and for those who sat in the land and shadow of death Light has dawned. -- matthew 4:16
.
From that time Jesus began to preach, crying out, Repent (change your mind for the better, heartily amend your ways, with abhorrence of your past sins), for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. -- matthew 4:17
.
As He was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He noticed two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, throwing a dragnet into the sea, for they were fishermen. -- matthew 4:18
.
And He said to them, Come after Me [as disciples--letting Me be your Guide], follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men! -- matthew 4:19
.
At once they left their nets and became His disciples [sided with His party and followed Him]. -- matthew 4:20
.
And going on further from there He noticed two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets and putting them right; and He called them. -- matthew 4:21
.
At once they left the boat and their father and joined Jesus as disciples [sided with His party and followed Him]. -- matthew 4:22
.
And He went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news (Gospel) of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness and infirmity among the people. -- matthew 4:23
.
So the report of Him spread throughout all Syria, and they brought Him all who were sick, those afflicted with various diseases and torments, those under the power of demons, and epileptics, and paralyzed people, and He healed them. -- matthew 4:24
.
And great crowds joined and accompanied Him about, coming from Galilee and Decapolis [the district of the ten cities east of the Sea of Galilee] and Jerusalem and Judea and from the other [the east] side of the Jordan. -- matthew 4:25
.
SEEING THE crowds, He went up on the mountain; and when He was seated, His disciples came to Him. -- matthew 5:1
.
Then He opened His mouth and taught them, saying: -- matthew 5:2
.
Blessed (happy, to be envied, and spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of their outward conditions) are the poor in spirit (the humble, who rate themselves insignificant), for theirs is the kingdom of heaven! -- matthew 5:3
.
Blessed and enviably happy [with a happiness produced by the experience of God's favor and especially conditioned by the revelation of His matchless grace] are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted! -- matthew 5:4
.
Blessed (happy, blithesome, joyous, spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of their outward conditions) are the meek (the mild, patient, long-suffering), for they shall inherit the earth! -- matthew 5:5
.
Blessed and fortunate and happy and spiritually prosperous (in that state in which the born-again child of God enjoys His favor and salvation) are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God), for they shall be completely satisfied! -- matthew 5:6
.
Blessed (happy, to be envied, and spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of their outward conditions) are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy! -- matthew 5:7
.
Blessed (happy, enviably fortunate, and spiritually prosperous--possessing the happiness produced by the experience of God's favor and especially conditioned by the revelation of His grace, regardless of their outward conditions) are the pure in heart, for they shall see God! -- matthew 5:8
.
Blessed (enjoying enviable happiness, spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of their outward conditions) are the makers and maintainers of peace, for they shall be called the sons of God! -- matthew 5:9
.
Blessed and happy and enviably fortunate and spiritually prosperous (in the state in which the born-again child of God enjoys and finds satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of his outward conditions) are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake (for being and doing right), for theirs is the kingdom of heaven! -- matthew 5:10
.
Blessed (happy, to be envied, and spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of your outward conditions) are you when people revile you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you falsely on My account. -- matthew 5:11
.
Be glad and supremely joyful, for your reward in heaven is great (strong and intense), for in this same way people persecuted the prophets who were before you. [II Chron. 36:16.] -- matthew 5:12
.
You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste (its strength, its quality), how can its saltness be restored? It is not good for anything any longer but to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men. -- matthew 5:13
.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. -- matthew 5:14
.
Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a peck measure, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. -- matthew 5:15
.
Let your light so shine before men that they may see your moral excellence and your praiseworthy, noble, and good deeds and recognize and honor and praise and glorify your Father Who is in heaven. -- matthew 5:16
.
Do not think that I have come to do away with or undo the Law or the Prophets; I have come not to do away with or undo but to complete and fulfill them. -- matthew 5:17
.
For truly I tell you, until the sky and earth pass away and perish, not one smallest letter nor one little hook [identifying certain Hebrew letters] will pass from the Law until all things [it foreshadows] are accomplished. -- matthew 5:18
.
Whoever then breaks or does away with or relaxes one of the least [important] of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least [important] in the kingdom of heaven, but he who practices them and teaches others to do so shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:19
.
For I tell you, unless your righteousness (your uprightness and your right standing with God) is more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:20
.
You have heard that it was said to the men of old, You shall not kill, and whoever kills shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court. -- matthew 5:21
.
But I say to you that everyone who continues to be angry with his brother or harbors malice (enmity of heart) against him shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court; and whoever speaks contemptuously and insultingly to his brother shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the Sanhedrin, and whoever says, You cursed fool! [You empty-headed idiot!] shall be liable to and unable to escape the hell (Gehenna) of fire. -- matthew 5:22
.
So if when you are offering your gift at the altar you there remember that your brother has any [grievance] against you, -- matthew 5:23
.
Leave your gift at the altar and go. First make peace with your brother, and then come back and present your gift. -- matthew 5:24
.
Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way traveling with him, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. -- matthew 5:25
.
Truly I say to you, you will not be released until you have paid the last fraction of a penny. -- matthew 5:26
.
You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery. -- matthew 5:27
.
But I say to you that everyone who so much as looks at a woman with evil desire for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. -- matthew 5:28
.
If your right eye serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be cast into hell (Gehenna). -- matthew 5:29
.
And if your right hand serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better that you lose one of your members than that your entire body should be cast into hell (Gehenna). -- matthew 5:30
.
It has also been said, Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce. -- matthew 5:31
.
But I tell you, Whoever dismisses and repudiates and divorces his wife, except on the grounds of unfaithfulness (sexual immorality), causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery. -- matthew 5:32
.
Again, you have heard that it was said to the men of old, You shall not swear falsely, but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord [as a religious duty]. -- matthew 5:33
.
But I tell you, Do not bind yourselves by an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is the throne of God; -- matthew 5:34
.
Or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. -- matthew 5:35
.
And do not swear by your head, for you are not able to make a single hair white or black. -- matthew 5:36
.
Let your Yes be simply Yes, and your No be simply No; anything more than that comes from the evil one. -- matthew 5:37
.
You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. -- matthew 5:38
.
But I say to you, Do not resist the evil man [who injures you]; but if anyone strikes you on the right jaw or cheek, turn to him the other one too. -- matthew 5:39
.
And if anyone wants to sue you and take your undershirt (tunic), let him have your coat also. -- matthew 5:40
.
And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two [miles]. -- matthew 5:41
.
Give to him who keeps on begging from you, and do not turn away from him who would borrow [at interest] from you. -- matthew 5:42
.
You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy; -- matthew 5:43
.
But I tell you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, -- matthew 5:44
.
To show that you are the children of your Father Who is in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the wicked and on the good, and makes the rain fall upon the upright and the wrongdoers [alike]. -- matthew 5:45
.
For if you love those who love you, what reward can you have? Do not even the tax collectors do that? -- matthew 5:46
.
And if you greet only your brethren, what more than others are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles (the heathen) do that? -- matthew 5:47
.
You, therefore, must be perfect [growing into complete maturity of godliness in mind and character, having reached the proper height of virtue and integrity], as your heavenly Father is perfect. -- matthew 5:48
.
TAKE CARE not to do your good deeds publicly or before men, in order to be seen by them; otherwise you will have no reward [reserved for and awaiting you] with and from your Father Who is in heaven. -- matthew 6:1
.
Thus, whenever you give to the poor, do not blow a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites in the synagogues and in the streets like to do, that they may be recognized and honored and praised by men. Truly I tell you, they have their reward in full already. -- matthew 6:2
.
But when you give to charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, -- matthew 6:3
.
So that your deeds of charity may be in secret; and your Father Who sees in secret will reward you openly. -- matthew 6:4
.
Also when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have their reward in full already. -- matthew 6:5
.
But when you pray, go into your [most] private room, and, closing the door, pray to your Father, Who is in secret; and your Father, Who sees in secret, will reward you in the open. -- matthew 6:6
.
And when you pray, do not heap up phrases (multiply words, repeating the same ones over and over) as the Gentiles do, for they think they will be heard for their much speaking. [I Kings 18:25-29.] -- matthew 6:7
.
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. -- matthew 6:8
.
Pray, therefore, like this: Our Father Who is in heaven, hallowed (kept holy) be Your name. -- matthew 6:9
.
Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. -- matthew 6:10
.
Give us this day our daily bread. -- matthew 6:11
.
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven (left, remitted, and let go of the debts, and have given up resentment against) our debtors. -- matthew 6:12
.
And lead (bring) us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. -- matthew 6:13
.
For if you forgive people their trespasses [their reckless and willful sins, leaving them, letting them go, and giving up resentment], your heavenly Father will also forgive you. -- matthew 6:14
.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses [their reckless and willful sins, leaving them, letting them go, and giving up resentment], neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. -- matthew 6:15
.
And whenever you are fasting, do not look gloomy and sour and dreary like the hypocrites, for they put on a dismal countenance, that their fasting may be apparent to and seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full already. -- matthew 6:16
.
But when you fast, perfume your head and wash your face, -- matthew 6:17
.
So that your fasting may not be noticed by men but by your Father, Who sees in secret; and your Father, Who sees in secret, will reward you in the open. -- matthew 6:18
.
Do not gather and heap up and store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust and worm consume and destroy, and where thieves break through and steal. -- matthew 6:19
.
But gather and heap up and store for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust nor worm consume and destroy, and where thieves do not break through and steal; -- matthew 6:20
.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. -- matthew 6:21
.
The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is sound, your entire body will be full of light. -- matthew 6:22
.
But if your eye is unsound, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the very light in you [your conscience] is darkened, how dense is that darkness! -- matthew 6:23
.
No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise and be against the other. You cannot serve God and mammon (deceitful riches, money, possessions, or whatever is trusted in). -- matthew 6:24
.
Therefore I tell you, stop being perpetually uneasy (anxious and worried) about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink; or about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life greater [in quality] than food, and the body [far above and more excellent] than clothing? -- matthew 6:25
.
Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father keeps feeding them. Are you not worth much more than they? -- matthew 6:26
.
And who of you by worrying and being anxious can add one unit of measure (cubit) to his stature or to the span of his life? -- matthew 6:27
.
And why should you be anxious about clothes? Consider the lilies of the field and learn thoroughly how they grow; they neither toil nor spin. -- matthew 6:28
.
Yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his magnificence (excellence, dignity, and grace) was not arrayed like one of these. [I Kings 10:4-7.] -- matthew 6:29
.
But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and green and tomorrow is tossed into the furnace, will He not much more surely clothe you, O you of little faith? -- matthew 6:30
.
Therefore do not worry and be anxious, saying, What are we going to have to eat? or, What are we going to have to drink? or, What are we going to have to wear? -- matthew 6:31
.
For the Gentiles (heathen) wish for and crave and diligently seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows well that you need them all. -- matthew 6:32
.
But seek (aim at and strive after) first of all His kingdom and His righteousness (His way of doing and being right), and then all these things taken together will be given you besides. -- matthew 6:33
.
So do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will have worries and anxieties of its own. Sufficient for each day is its own trouble. -- matthew 6:34
.
DO NOT judge and criticize and condemn others, so that you may not be judged and criticized and condemned yourselves. -- matthew 7:1
.
For just as you judge and criticize and condemn others, you will be judged and criticized and condemned, and in accordance with the measure you [use to] deal out to others, it will be dealt out again to you. -- matthew 7:2
.
Why do you stare from without at the very small particle that is in your brother's eye but do not become aware of and consider the beam of timber that is in your own eye? -- matthew 7:3
.
Or how can you say to your brother, Let me get the tiny particle out of your eye, when there is the beam of timber in your own eye? -- matthew 7:4
.
You hypocrite, first get the beam of timber out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the tiny particle out of your brother's eye. -- matthew 7:5
.
Do not give that which is holy (the sacred thing) to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before hogs, lest they trample upon them with their feet and turn and tear you in pieces. -- matthew 7:6
.
Keep on asking and it will be given you; keep on seeking and you will find; keep on knocking [reverently] and [the door] will be opened to you. -- matthew 7:7
.
For everyone who keeps on asking receives; and he who keeps on seeking finds; and to him who keeps on knocking, [the door] will be opened. -- matthew 7:8
.
Or what man is there of you, if his son asks him for a loaf of bread, will hand him a stone? -- matthew 7:9
.
Or if he asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent? -- matthew 7:10
.
If you then, evil as you are, know how to give good and advantageous gifts to your children, how much more will your Father Who is in heaven [perfect as He is] give good and advantageous things to those who keep on asking Him! -- matthew 7:11
.
So then, whatever you desire that others would do to and for you, even so do also to and for them, for this is (sums up) the Law and the Prophets. -- matthew 7:12
.
Enter through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and spacious and broad is the way that leads away to destruction, and many are those who are entering through it. -- matthew 7:13
.
But the gate is narrow (contracted by pressure) and the way is straitened and compressed that leads away to life, and few are those who find it. -- matthew 7:14
.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you dressed as sheep, but inside they are devouring wolves. -- matthew 7:15
.
You will fully recognize them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? -- matthew 7:16
.
Even so, every healthy (sound) tree bears good fruit [worthy of admiration], but the sickly (decaying, worthless) tree bears bad (worthless) fruit. -- matthew 7:17
.
A good (healthy) tree cannot bear bad (worthless) fruit, nor can a bad (diseased) tree bear excellent fruit [worthy of admiration]. -- matthew 7:18
.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. -- matthew 7:19
.
Therefore, you will fully know them by their fruits. -- matthew 7:20
.
Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in heaven. -- matthew 7:21
.
Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name and driven out demons in Your name and done many mighty works in Your name? -- matthew 7:22
.
And then I will say to them openly (publicly), I never knew you; depart from Me, you who act wickedly [disregarding My commands]. -- matthew 7:23
.
So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them [obeying them] will be like a sensible (prudent, practical, wise) man who built his house upon the rock. -- matthew 7:24
.
And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. -- matthew 7:25
.
And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them will be like a stupid (foolish) man who built his house upon the sand. -- matthew 7:26
.
And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell--and great and complete was the fall of it. -- matthew 7:27
.
When Jesus had finished these sayings [the Sermon on the Mount], the crowds were astonished and overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His teaching, -- matthew 7:28
.
For He was teaching as One Who had [and was] authority, and not as [did] the scribes. -- matthew 7:29
.
WHEN JESUS came down from the mountain, great throngs followed Him. -- matthew 8:1
.
And behold, a leper came up to Him and, prostrating himself, worshiped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You are able to cleanse me by curing me. -- matthew 8:2
.
And He reached out His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed by being cured. And instantly his leprosy was cured and cleansed. -- matthew 8:3
.
And Jesus said to him, See that you tell nothing about this to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded, for a testimony [to your healing] and as an evidence to the people. -- matthew 8:4
.
As Jesus went into Capernaum, a centurion came up to Him, begging Him, -- matthew 8:5
.
And saying, Lord, my servant boy is lying at the house paralyzed and distressed with intense pains. -- matthew 8:6
.
And Jesus said to him, I will come and restore him. -- matthew 8:7
.
But the centurion replied to Him, Lord, I am not worthy or fit to have You come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my servant boy will be cured. -- matthew 8:8
.
For I also am a man subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it. -- matthew 8:9
.
When Jesus heard him, He marveled and said to those who followed Him [who adhered steadfastly to Him, conforming to His example in living and, if need be, in dying also], I tell you truly, I have not found so much faith as this with anyone, even in Israel. -- matthew 8:10
.
I tell you, many will come from east and west, and will sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, -- matthew 8:11
.
While the sons and heirs of the kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. -- matthew 8:12
.
Then to the centurion Jesus said, Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed. And the servant boy was restored to health at that very moment. -- matthew 8:13
.
And when Jesus went into Peter's house, He saw his mother-in-law lying ill with a fever. -- matthew 8:14
.
He touched her hand and the fever left her; and she got up and began waiting on Him. -- matthew 8:15
.
When evening came, they brought to Him many who were under the power of demons, and He drove out the spirits with a word and restored to health all who were sick. -- matthew 8:16
.
And thus He fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, He Himself took [in order to carry away] our weaknesses and infirmities and bore away our diseases. -- matthew 8:17
.
Now Jesus, when He saw the great throngs around Him, gave orders to cross to the other side [of the lake]. -- matthew 8:18
.
And a scribe came up and said to Him, Master, I will accompany You wherever You go. -- matthew 8:19
.
And Jesus replied to him, Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have lodging places, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head. -- matthew 8:20
.
Another of the disciples said to Him, Lord, let me first go and bury [care for till death] my father. -- matthew 8:21
.
But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and leave the dead [in sin] to bury their own dead. -- matthew 8:22
.
And after He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. -- matthew 8:23
.
And suddenly, behold, there arose a violent storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered up by the waves; but He was sleeping. -- matthew 8:24
.
And they went and awakened Him, saying, Lord, rescue and preserve us! We are perishing! -- matthew 8:25
.
And He said to them, Why are you timid and afraid, O you of little faith? Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great and wonderful calm (a perfect peaceableness). -- matthew 8:26
.
And the men were stunned with bewildered wonder and marveled, saying, What kind of Man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him! -- matthew 8:27
.
And when He arrived at the other side in the country of the Gadarenes, two men under the control of demons went to meet Him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce and savage that no one was able to pass that way. -- matthew 8:28
.
And behold, they shrieked and screamed, What have You to do with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come to torment us before the appointed time? -- matthew 8:29
.
Now at some distance from there a drove of many hogs was grazing. -- matthew 8:30
.
And the demons begged Him, If You drive us out, send us into the drove of hogs. -- matthew 8:31
.
And He said to them, Begone! So they came out and went into the hogs, and behold, the whole drove rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water. -- matthew 8:32
.
The herdsmen fled and went into the town and reported everything, including what had happened to the men under the power of demons. -- matthew 8:33
.
And behold, the whole town went out to meet Jesus; and as soon as they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their locality. -- matthew 8:34
.
AND JESUS, getting into a boat, crossed to the other side and came to His own town [Capernaum]. -- matthew 9:1
.
And behold, they brought to Him a man paralyzed and prostrated by illness, lying on a sleeping pad; and when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralyzed man, Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven and the penalty remitted. -- matthew 9:2
.
And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, This man blasphemes [He claims the rights and prerogatives of God]! -- matthew 9:3
.
But Jesus, knowing (seeing) their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil and harbor malice in your hearts? -- matthew 9:4
.
For which is easier: to say, Your sins are forgiven and the penalty remitted, or to say, Get up and walk? -- matthew 9:5
.
But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins and remit the penalty, He then said to the paralyzed man, Get up! Pick up your sleeping pad and go to your own house. -- matthew 9:6
.
And he got up and went away to his own house. -- matthew 9:7
.
When the crowds saw it, they were struck with fear and awe; and they recognized God and praised and thanked Him, Who had given such power and authority to men. -- matthew 9:8
.
As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's office; and He said to him, Be My disciple [side with My party and follow Me]. And he rose and followed Him. -- matthew 9:9
.
And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and [especially wicked] sinners came and sat (reclined) with Him and His disciples. -- matthew 9:10
.
And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, Why does your Master eat with tax collectors and those [preeminently] sinful? -- matthew 9:11
.
But when Jesus heard it, He replied, Those who are strong and well (healthy) have no need of a physician, but those who are weak and sick. -- matthew 9:12
.
Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy [that is, readiness to help those in trouble] and not sacrifice and sacrificial victims. For I came not to call and invite [to repentance] the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God), but sinners (the erring ones and all those not free from sin). -- matthew 9:13
.
Then the disciples of John came to Jesus, inquiring, Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, [that is, abstain from food and drink as a religious exercise], but Your disciples do not fast? -- matthew 9:14
.
And Jesus replied to them, Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is still with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. -- matthew 9:15
.
And no one puts a piece of cloth that has not been shrunk on an old garment, for such a patch tears away from the garment and a worse rent (tear) is made. -- matthew 9:16
.
Neither is new wine put in old wineskins; for if it is, the skins burst and are torn in pieces, and the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved. -- matthew 9:17
.
While He was talking this way to them, behold, a ruler entered and, kneeling down, worshiped Him, saying, My daughter has just now died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will come to life. -- matthew 9:18
.
And Jesus got up and accompanied him, with His disciples. -- matthew 9:19
.
And behold, a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment; -- matthew 9:20
.
For she kept saying to herself, If I only touch His garment, I shall be restored to health. -- matthew 9:21
.
Jesus turned around and, seeing her, He said, Take courage, daughter! Your faith has made you well. And at once the woman was restored to health. -- matthew 9:22
.
And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making an uproar and din, -- matthew 9:23
.
He said, Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping. And they laughed and jeered at Him. -- matthew 9:24
.
But when the crowd had been ordered to go outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. -- matthew 9:25
.
And the news about this spread through all that district. -- matthew 9:26
.
As Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, shouting loudly, Have pity and mercy on us, Son of David! -- matthew 9:27
.
When He reached the house and went in, the blind men came to Him, and Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him, Yes, Lord. -- matthew 9:28
.
Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith and trust and reliance [on the power invested in Me] be it done to you; -- matthew 9:29
.
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus earnestly and sternly charged them, See that you let no one know about this. -- matthew 9:30
.
But they went off and blazed and spread His fame abroad throughout that whole district. -- matthew 9:31
.
And while they were going away, behold, a dumb man under the power of a demon was brought to Jesus. -- matthew 9:32
.
And when the demon was driven out, the dumb man spoke; and the crowds were stunned with bewildered wonder, saying, Never before has anything like this been seen in Israel. -- matthew 9:33
.
But the Pharisees said, He drives out demons through and with the help of the prince of demons. -- matthew 9:34
.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and every weakness and infirmity. -- matthew 9:35
.
When He saw the throngs, He was moved with pity and sympathy for them, because they were bewildered (harassed and distressed and dejected and helpless), like sheep without a shepherd. -- matthew 9:36
.
Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. -- matthew 9:37
.
So pray to the Lord of the harvest to force out and thrust laborers into His harvest. -- matthew 9:38
.
AND JESUS summoned to Him His twelve disciples and gave them power and authority over unclean spirits, to drive them out, and to cure all kinds of disease and all kinds of weakness and infirmity. -- matthew 10:1
.
Now these are the names of the twelve apostles (special messengers): first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee, and John his brother; -- matthew 10:2
.
Philip and Bartholomew [Nathaniel]; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus [Judas, not Iscariot]; -- matthew 10:3
.
Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. -- matthew 10:4
.
Jesus sent out these twelve, charging them, Go nowhere among the Gentiles and do not go into any town of the Samaritans; -- matthew 10:5
.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. -- matthew 10:6
.
And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand! -- matthew 10:7
.
Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely (without pay) you have received, freely (without charge) give. -- matthew 10:8
.
Take no gold nor silver nor [even] copper money in your purses (belts); -- matthew 10:9
.
And do not take a provision bag or a wallet for a collection bag for your journey, nor two undergarments, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the workman deserves his support (his living, his food). -- matthew 10:10
.
And into whatever town or village you go, inquire who in it is deserving, and stay there [at his house] until you leave [that vicinity]. -- matthew 10:11
.
As you go into the house, give your greetings and wish it well. -- matthew 10:12
.
Then if indeed that house is deserving, let come upon it your peace [that is, freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin]. But if it is not deserving, let your peace return to you. -- matthew 10:13
.
And whoever will not receive and accept and welcome you nor listen to your message, as you leave that house or town, shake the dust [of it] from your feet. -- matthew 10:14
.
Truly I tell you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town. -- matthew 10:15
.
Behold, I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves; be wary and wise as serpents, and be innocent (harmless, guileless, and without falsity) as doves. -- matthew 10:16
.
Be on guard against men [whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God]; for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues, -- matthew 10:17
.
And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a witness to bear testimony before them and to the Gentiles (the nations). -- matthew 10:18
.
But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you are to speak; for what you are to say will be given you in that very hour and moment, -- matthew 10:19
.
For it is not you who are speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. -- matthew 10:20
.
Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will take a stand against their parents and will have them put to death. -- matthew 10:21
.
And you will be hated by all for My name's sake, but he who perseveres and endures to the end will be saved [from spiritual disease and death in the world to come]. -- matthew 10:22
.
When they persecute you in one town [that is, pursue you in a manner that would injure you and cause you to suffer because of your belief], flee to another town; for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. -- matthew 10:23
.
A disciple is not above his teacher, nor is a servant or slave above his master. -- matthew 10:24
.
It is sufficient for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant or slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub [master of the dwelling], how much more will they speak evil of those of His household. [II Kings 1:2.] -- matthew 10:25
.
So have no fear of them; for nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, or kept secret that will not become known. -- matthew 10:26
.
What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops. -- matthew 10:27
.
And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be afraid of Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell (Gehenna). -- matthew 10:28
.
Are not two little sparrows sold for a penny? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's leave (consent) and notice. -- matthew 10:29
.
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. -- matthew 10:30
.
Fear not, then; you are of more value than many sparrows. -- matthew 10:31
.
Therefore, everyone who acknowledges Me before men and confesses Me [out of a state of oneness with Me], I will also acknowledge him before My Father Who is in heaven and confess [that I am abiding in] him. -- matthew 10:32
.
But whoever denies and disowns Me before men, I also will deny and disown him before My Father Who is in heaven. -- matthew 10:33
.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. -- matthew 10:34
.
For I have come to part asunder a man from his father, and a daughter from her mother, and a newly married wife from her mother-in-law-- -- matthew 10:35
.
And a man's foes will be they of his own household. -- matthew 10:36
.
He who loves [and takes more pleasure in] father or mother more than [in] Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves [and takes more pleasure in] son or daughter more than [in] Me is not worthy of Me; -- matthew 10:37
.
And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me [cleave steadfastly to Me, conforming wholly to My example in living and, if need be, in dying also] is not worthy of Me. -- matthew 10:38
.
Whoever finds his [lower] life will lose it [the higher life], and whoever loses his [lower] life on My account will find it [the higher life]. -- matthew 10:39
.
He who receives and welcomes and accepts you receives and welcomes and accepts Me, and he who receives and welcomes and accepts Me receives and welcomes and accepts Him Who sent Me. -- matthew 10:40
.
He who receives and welcomes and accepts a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives and welcomes and accepts a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. -- matthew 10:41
.
And whoever gives to one of these little ones [in rank or influence] even a cup of cold water because he is My disciple, surely I declare to you, he shall not lose his reward. -- matthew 10:42
.
WHEN JESUS had finished His charge to His twelve disciples, He left there to teach and to preach in their [Galilean] cities. -- matthew 11:1
.
Now when John in prison heard about the activities of Christ, he sent a message by his disciples -- matthew 11:2
.
And asked Him, Are You the One Who was to come, or should we keep on expecting a different one? -- matthew 11:3
.
And Jesus replied to them, Go and report to John what you hear and see: -- matthew 11:4
.
The blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed (by healing) and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up and the poor have good news (the Gospel) preached to them. -- matthew 11:5
.
And blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) is he who takes no offense at Me and finds no cause for stumbling in or through Me and is not hindered from seeing the Truth. -- matthew 11:6
.
Then as these men went their way, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out in the wilderness (desert) to see? A reed swayed by the wind? -- matthew 11:7
.
What did you go out to see then? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings. -- matthew 11:8
.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one [out of the common, more eminent, more remarkable, and] superior to a prophet. -- matthew 11:9
.
This is the one of whom it is written, Behold, I send My messenger ahead of You, who shall make ready Your way before You. -- matthew 11:10
.
Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. -- matthew 11:11
.
And from the days of John the Baptist until the present time, the kingdom of heaven has endured violent assault, and violent men seize it by force [as a precious prize--a share in the heavenly kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal and intense exertion]. -- matthew 11:12
.
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied up until John. -- matthew 11:13
.
And if you are willing to receive and accept it, John himself is Elijah who was to come [before the kingdom]. -- matthew 11:14
.
He who has ears to hear, let him be listening and let him consider and perceive and comprehend by hearing. -- matthew 11:15
.
But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces who call to their playmates, -- matthew 11:16
.
We piped to you [playing wedding], and you did not dance; we wailed dirges [playing funeral], and you did not mourn and beat your breasts and weep aloud. -- matthew 11:17
.
For John came neither eating nor drinking [with others], and they say, He has a demon! -- matthew 11:18
.
The Son of Man came eating and drinking [with others], and they say, Behold, a glutton and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and [especially wicked] sinners! Yet wisdom is justified and vindicated by what she does (her deeds) and by her children. -- matthew 11:19
.
Then He began to censure and reproach the cities in which most of His mighty works had been performed, because they did not repent [and their hearts were not changed]. -- matthew 11:20
.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes [and their hearts would have been changed]. -- matthew 11:21
.
I tell you [further], it shall be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. -- matthew 11:22
.
And you, Capernaum, are you to be lifted up to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades [the region of the dead]! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have continued until today. -- matthew 11:23
.
But I tell you, it shall be more endurable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. -- matthew 11:24
.
At that time Jesus began to say, I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth [and I acknowledge openly and joyfully to Your honor], that You have hidden these things from the wise and clever and learned, and revealed them to babies [to the childish, untaught, and unskilled]. -- matthew 11:25
.
Yes, Father, [I praise You that] such was Your gracious will and good pleasure. -- matthew 11:26
.
All things have been entrusted and delivered to Me by My Father; and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Son except the Father, and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son deliberately wills to make Him known. -- matthew 11:27
.
Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy-laden and overburdened, and I will cause you to rest. [I will ease and relieve and refresh your souls.] -- matthew 11:28
.
Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am gentle (meek) and humble (lowly) in heart, and you will find rest (relief and ease and refreshment and recreation and blessed quiet) for your souls. -- matthew 11:29
.
For My yoke is wholesome (useful, good--not harsh, hard, sharp, or pressing, but comfortable, gracious, and pleasant), and My burden is light and easy to be borne. -- matthew 11:30
.
AT THAT particular time Jesus went through the fields of standing grain on the Sabbath; and His disciples were hungry, and they began to pick off the spikes of grain and to eat. -- matthew 12:1
.
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, See there! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful and not permitted on the Sabbath. -- matthew 12:2
.
He said to them, Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry, and those who accompanied him-- -- matthew 12:3
.
How he went into the house of God and ate the loaves of the showbread--which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for the men who accompanied him, but for the priests only? -- matthew 12:4
.
Or have you never read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath [breaking it] and yet are guiltless? -- matthew 12:5
.
But I tell you, Something greater and more exalted and more majestic than the temple is here! -- matthew 12:6
.
And if you had only known what this saying means, I desire mercy [readiness to help, to spare, to forgive] rather than sacrifice and sacrificial victims, you would not have condemned the guiltless. -- matthew 12:7
.
For the Son of Man is Lord [even] of the Sabbath. -- matthew 12:8
.
And going on from there, He went into their synagogue. -- matthew 12:9
.
And behold, a man was there with one withered hand. And they said to Him, Is it lawful or allowable to cure people on the Sabbath days?--that they might accuse Him. -- matthew 12:10
.
But He said to them, What man is there among you, if he has only one sheep and it falls into a pit or ditch on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? -- matthew 12:11
.
How much better and of more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful and allowable to do good on the Sabbath days. -- matthew 12:12
.
Then He said to the man, Reach out your hand. And the man reached it out and it was restored, as sound as the other one. -- matthew 12:13
.
But the Pharisees went out and held a consultation against Him, how they might do away with Him. -- matthew 12:14
.
But being aware of this, Jesus went away from there. And many people joined and accompanied Him, and He cured all of them, -- matthew 12:15
.
And strictly charged them and sharply warned them not to make Him publicly known. -- matthew 12:16
.
This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, -- matthew 12:17
.
Behold, My Servant Whom I have chosen, My Beloved in and with Whom My soul is well pleased and has found its delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He shall proclaim and show forth justice to the nations. -- matthew 12:18
.
He will not strive or wrangle or cry out loudly; nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets; -- matthew 12:19
.
A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering (dimly burning) wick He will not quench, till He brings justice and a just cause to victory. -- matthew 12:20
.
And in and on His name will the Gentiles (the peoples outside of Israel) set their hopes. -- matthew 12:21
.
Then a blind and dumb man under the power of a demon was brought to Jesus, and He cured him, so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw. -- matthew 12:22
.
And all the [crowds of] people were stunned with bewildered wonder and said, This cannot be the Son of David, can it? -- matthew 12:23
.
But the Pharisees, hearing it, said, This Man drives out demons only by and with the help of Beelzebub, the prince of demons. -- matthew 12:24
.
And knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Any kingdom that is divided against itself is being brought to desolation and laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will last or continue to stand. -- matthew 12:25
.
And if Satan drives out Satan, he has become divided against himself and disunified; how then will his kingdom last or continue to stand? -- matthew 12:26
.
And if I drive out the demons by [help of] Beelzebub, by whose [help] do your sons drive them out? For this reason they shall be your judges. -- matthew 12:27
.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you [before you expected it]. -- matthew 12:28
.
Or how can a person go into a strong man's house and carry off his goods (the entire equipment of his house) without first binding the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. -- matthew 12:29
.
He who is not with Me [definitely on My side] is against Me, and he who does not [definitely] gather with Me and for My side scatters. -- matthew 12:30
.
Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy (every evil, abusive, injurious speaking, or indignity against sacred things) can be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the [Holy] Spirit shall not and cannot be forgiven. -- matthew 12:31
.
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Spirit, the Holy One, will not be forgiven, either in this world and age or in the world and age to come. -- matthew 12:32
.
Either make the tree sound (healthy and good), and its fruit sound (healthy and good), or make the tree rotten (diseased and bad), and its fruit rotten (diseased and bad); for the tree is known and recognized and judged by its fruit. -- matthew 12:33
.
You offspring of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil (wicked)? For out of the fullness (the overflow, the superabundance) of the heart the mouth speaks. -- matthew 12:34
.
The good man from his inner good treasure flings forth good things, and the evil man out of his inner evil storehouse flings forth evil things. -- matthew 12:35
.
But I tell you, on the day of judgment men will have to give account for every idle (inoperative, nonworking) word they speak. -- matthew 12:36
.
For by your words you will be justified and acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned and sentenced. -- matthew 12:37
.
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, Teacher, we desire to see a sign or miracle from You [proving that You are what You claim to be]. -- matthew 12:38
.
But He replied to them, An evil and adulterous generation (a generation morally unfaithful to God) seeks and demands a sign; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. -- matthew 12:39
.
For even as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. -- matthew 12:40
.
The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, Someone more and greater than Jonah is here! -- matthew 12:41
.
The queen of the South will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, Someone more and greater than Solomon is here. [I Kings 10:1; II Chron. 9:1.] -- matthew 12:42
.
But when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, it roams through dry [arid] places in search of rest, but it does not find any. -- matthew 12:43
.
Then it says, I will go back to my house from which I came out. And when it arrives, it finds the place unoccupied, swept, put in order, and decorated. -- matthew 12:44
.
Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and make their home there. And the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. So also shall it be with this wicked generation. -- matthew 12:45
.
Jesus was still speaking to the people when behold, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to Him. -- matthew 12:46
.
Someone said to Him, Listen! Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to You. -- matthew 12:47
.
But He replied to the man who told Him, Who is My mother, and who are My brothers? -- matthew 12:48
.
And stretching out His hand toward [not only the twelve disciples but all] His adherents, He said, Here are My mother and My brothers. -- matthew 12:49
.
For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother! -- matthew 12:50
.
THAT SAME day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting beside the sea. -- matthew 13:1
.
But such great crowds gathered about Him that He got into a boat and remained sitting there, while all the throng stood on the shore. -- matthew 13:2
.
And He told them many things in parables (stories by way of illustration and comparison), saying, A sower went out to sow. -- matthew 13:3
.
And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and ate them up. -- matthew 13:4
.
Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they had not much soil; and at once they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil. -- matthew 13:5
.
But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they dried up and withered away. -- matthew 13:6
.
Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them out. -- matthew 13:7
.
Other seeds fell on good soil, and yielded grain--some a hundred times as much as was sown, some sixty times as much, and some thirty. -- matthew 13:8
.
He who has ears [to hear], let him be listening and let him consider and perceive and comprehend by hearing. -- matthew 13:9
.
Then the disciples came to Him and said, Why do You speak to them in parables? -- matthew 13:10
.
And He replied to them, To you it has been given to know the secrets and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. -- matthew 13:11
.
For whoever has [spiritual knowledge], to him will more be given and he will be furnished richly so that he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. -- matthew 13:12
.
This is the reason that I speak to them in parables: because having the power of seeing, they do not see; and having the power of hearing, they do not hear, nor do they grasp and understand. -- matthew 13:13
.
In them indeed is the process of fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah, which says: You shall indeed hear and hear but never grasp and understand; and you shall indeed look and look but never see and perceive. -- matthew 13:14
.
For this nation's heart has grown gross (fat and dull), and their ears heavy and difficult of hearing, and their eyes they have tightly closed, lest they see and perceive with their eyes, and hear and comprehend the sense with their ears, and grasp and understand with their heart, and turn and I should heal them. -- matthew 13:15
.
But blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are your eyes because they do see, and your ears because they do hear. -- matthew 13:16
.
Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous men [men who were upright and in right standing with God] yearned to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. -- matthew 13:17
.
Listen then to the [meaning of the] parable of the sower: -- matthew 13:18
.
While anyone is hearing the Word of the kingdom and does not grasp and comprehend it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the roadside. -- matthew 13:19
.
As for what was sown on thin (rocky) soil, this is he who hears the Word and at once welcomes and accepts it with joy; -- matthew 13:20
.
Yet it has no real root in him, but is temporary (inconstant, lasts but a little while); and when affliction or trouble or persecution comes on account of the Word, at once he is caused to stumble [he is repelled and begins to distrust and desert Him Whom he ought to trust and obey] and he falls away. -- matthew 13:21
.
As for what was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the Word, but the cares of the world and the pleasure and delight and glamour and deceitfulness of riches choke and suffocate the Word, and it yields no fruit. -- matthew 13:22
.
As for what was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the Word and grasps and comprehends it; he indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundred times as much as was sown, in another sixty times as much, and in another thirty. -- matthew 13:23
.
Another parable He set forth before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. -- matthew 13:24
.
But while he was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed also darnel (weeds resembling wheat) among the wheat, and went on his way. -- matthew 13:25
.
So when the plants sprouted and formed grain, the darnel (weeds) appeared also. -- matthew 13:26
.
And the servants of the owner came to him and said, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then how does it have darnel shoots in it? -- matthew 13:27
.
He replied to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and weed them out? -- matthew 13:28
.
But he said, No, lest in gathering the wild wheat (weeds resembling wheat), you root up the [true] wheat along with it. -- matthew 13:29
.
Let them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will say to the reapers, Gather the darnel first and bind it in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my granary. -- matthew 13:30
.
Another story by way of comparison He set forth before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. -- matthew 13:31
.
Of all the seeds it is the smallest, but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and find shelter in its branches. -- matthew 13:32
.
He told them another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven (sour dough) which a woman took and covered over in three measures of meal or flour till all of it was leavened. -- matthew 13:33
.
These things all taken together Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, without a parable He said nothing to them. -- matthew 13:34
.
This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet: I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things that have been hidden since the foundation of the world. -- matthew 13:35
.
Then He left the throngs and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field. -- matthew 13:36
.
He answered, He Who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. -- matthew 13:37
.
The field is the world, and the good seed means the children of the kingdom; the darnel is the children of the evil one, -- matthew 13:38
.
And the enemy who sowed it is the devil. The harvest is the close and consummation of the age, and the reapers are angels. -- matthew 13:39
.
Just as the darnel (weeds resembling wheat) is gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the close of the age. -- matthew 13:40
.
The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of offense [persons by whom others are drawn into error or sin] and all who do iniquity and act wickedly, -- matthew 13:41
.
And will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth. -- matthew 13:42
.
Then will the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God) shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him who has ears [to hear] be listening, and let him consider and perceive and understand by hearing. -- matthew 13:43
.
The kingdom of heaven is like something precious buried in a field, which a man found and hid again; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field. -- matthew 13:44
.
Again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a dealer in search of fine and precious pearls, -- matthew 13:45
.
Who, on finding a single pearl of great price, went and sold all he had and bought it. -- matthew 13:46
.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet which was cast into the sea and gathered in fish of every sort. -- matthew 13:47
.
When it was full, men dragged it up on the beach, and sat down and sorted out the good fish into baskets, but the worthless ones they threw away. -- matthew 13:48
.
So it will be at the close and consummation of the age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God) -- matthew 13:49
.
And cast them [the wicked] into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth. -- matthew 13:50
.
Have you understood all these things [parables] taken together? They said to Him, Yes, Lord. -- matthew 13:51
.
He said to them, Therefore every teacher and interpreter of the Sacred Writings who has been instructed about and trained for the kingdom of heaven and has become a disciple is like a householder who brings forth out of his storehouse treasure that is new and [treasure that is] old [the fresh as well as the familiar]. -- matthew 13:52
.
When Jesus had finished these parables (these comparisons), He left there. -- matthew 13:53
.
And coming to His own country [Nazareth], He taught in their synagogue so that they were amazed with bewildered wonder, and said, Where did this Man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? -- matthew 13:54
.
Is not this the carpenter's Son? Is not His mother called Mary? And are not His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? -- matthew 13:55
.
And do not all His sisters live here among us? Where then did this Man get all this? -- matthew 13:56
.
And they took offense at Him [they were repelled and hindered from acknowledging His authority, and caused to stumble]. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house. -- matthew 13:57
.
And He did not do many works of power there, because of their unbelief (their lack of faith in the divine mission of Jesus). -- matthew 13:58
.
AT THAT time Herod the governor heard the reports about Jesus, -- matthew 14:1
.
And he said to his attendants, This is John the Baptist; He has been raised from the dead, and that is why the powers of performing miracles are at work in Him. -- matthew 14:2
.
For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison [to stow him out of the way] on account and for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, -- matthew 14:3
.
For John had said to him, It is not lawful or right for you to have her. -- matthew 14:4
.
Although he wished to have him put to death, he was afraid of the people, for they regarded John as a prophet. -- matthew 14:5
.
But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst [before the company] and pleased and fascinated Herod, -- matthew 14:6
.
And so he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. -- matthew 14:7
.
And she, being put forward and prompted by her mother, said, Give me the head of John the Baptist right here on a platter. -- matthew 14:8
.
And the king was distressed and sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests, he ordered it to be given her; -- matthew 14:9
.
He sent and had John beheaded in the prison. -- matthew 14:10
.
And his head was brought in on a platter and given to the little maid, and she brought it to her mother. -- matthew 14:11
.
And John's disciples came and took up the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. -- matthew 14:12
.
When Jesus heard it, He withdrew from there privately in a boat to a solitary place. But when the crowds heard of it, they followed Him [by land] on foot from the towns. -- matthew 14:13
.
When He went ashore and saw a great throng of people, He had compassion (pity and deep sympathy) for them and cured their sick. -- matthew 14:14
.
When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, This is a remote and barren place, and the day is now over; send the throngs away into the villages to buy food for themselves. -- matthew 14:15
.
Jesus said, They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat. -- matthew 14:16
.
They said to Him, We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish. -- matthew 14:17
.
He said, Bring them here to Me. -- matthew 14:18
.
Then He ordered the crowds to recline on the grass; and He took the five loaves and the two fish, and, looking up to heaven, He gave thanks and blessed and broke the loaves and handed the pieces to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. -- matthew 14:19
.
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they picked up twelve [small hand] baskets full of the broken pieces left over. -- matthew 14:20
.
And those who ate were about 5,men, not including women and children. -- matthew 14:21
.
Then He directed the disciples to get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent away the crowds. -- matthew 14:22
.
And after He had dismissed the multitudes, He went up into the hills by Himself to pray. When it was evening, He was still there alone. -- matthew 14:23
.
But the boat was by this time out on the sea, many furlongs [a furlong is one-eighth of a mile] distant from the land, beaten and tossed by the waves, for the wind was against them. -- matthew 14:24
.
And in the fourth watch [between 3:00--6:a.m.] of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea. -- matthew 14:25
.
And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified and said, It is a ghost! And they screamed out with fright. -- matthew 14:26
.
But instantly He spoke to them, saying, Take courage! I AM! Stop being afraid! -- matthew 14:27
.
And Peter answered Him, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water. -- matthew 14:28
.
He said, Come! So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water, and he came toward Jesus. -- matthew 14:29
.
But when he perceived and felt the strong wind, he was frightened, and as he began to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me [from death]! -- matthew 14:30
.
Instantly Jesus reached out His hand and caught and held him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? -- matthew 14:31
.
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. -- matthew 14:32
.
And those in the boat knelt and worshiped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God! -- matthew 14:33
.
And when they had crossed over to the other side, they went ashore at Gennesaret. -- matthew 14:34
.
And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent around into all the surrounding country and brought to Him all who were sick -- matthew 14:35
.
And begged Him to let them merely touch the fringe of His garment; and as many as touched it were perfectly restored. -- matthew 14:36
.
THEN FROM Jerusalem came scribes and Pharisees and said, -- matthew 15:1
.
Why do Your disciples transgress and violate the rules handed down by the elders of the past? For they do not practice [ceremonially] washing their hands before they eat. -- matthew 15:2
.
He replied to them, And why also do you transgress and violate the commandment of God for the sake of the rules handed down to you by your forefathers (the elders)? -- matthew 15:3
.
For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother, and, He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother, let him surely come to his end by death. -- matthew 15:4
.
But you say, If anyone tells his father or mother, What you would have gained from me [that is, the money and whatever I have that might be used for helping you] is already dedicated as a gift to God, then he is exempt and no longer under obligation to honor and help his father or his mother. -- matthew 15:5
.
So for the sake of your tradition (the rules handed down by your forefathers), you have set aside the Word of God [depriving it of force and authority and making it of no effect]. -- matthew 15:6
.
You pretenders (hypocrites)! Admirably and truly did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said: -- matthew 15:7
.
These people draw near Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, but their hearts hold off and are far away from Me. -- matthew 15:8
.
Uselessly do they worship Me, for they teach as doctrines the commands of men. -- matthew 15:9
.
And Jesus called the people to Him and said to them, Listen and grasp and comprehend this: -- matthew 15:10
.
It is not what goes into the mouth of a man that makes him unclean and defiled, but what comes out of the mouth; this makes a man unclean and defiles [him]. -- matthew 15:11
.
Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were displeased and offended and indignant when they heard this saying? -- matthew 15:12
.
He answered, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be torn up by the roots. -- matthew 15:13
.
Let them alone and disregard them; they are blind guides and teachers. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a ditch. -- matthew 15:14
.
But Peter said to Him, Explain this proverb (this maxim) to us. -- matthew 15:15
.
And He said, Are you also even yet dull and ignorant [without understanding and unable to put things together]? -- matthew 15:16
.
Do you not see and understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the abdomen and so passes on into the place where discharges are deposited? -- matthew 15:17
.
But whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and this is what makes a man unclean and defiles [him]. -- matthew 15:18
.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts (reasonings and disputings and designs) such as murder, adultery, sexual vice, theft, false witnessing, slander, and irreverent speech. -- matthew 15:19
.
These are what make a man unclean and defile [him]; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean or defile [him]. -- matthew 15:20
.
And going away from there, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. -- matthew 15:21
.
And behold, a woman who was a Canaanite from that district came out and, with a [loud, troublesomely urgent] cry, begged, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is miserably and distressingly and cruelly possessed by a demon! -- matthew 15:22
.
But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us. -- matthew 15:23
.
He answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. -- matthew 15:24
.
But she came and, kneeling, worshiped Him and kept praying, Lord, help me! -- matthew 15:25
.
And He answered, It is not right (proper, becoming, or fair) to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs. -- matthew 15:26
.
She said, Yes, Lord, yet even the little pups (little whelps) eat the crumbs that fall from their [young] masters' table. -- matthew 15:27
.
Then Jesus answered her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you wish. And her daughter was cured from that moment. -- matthew 15:28
.
And Jesus went on from there and passed along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up into the hills and kept sitting there. -- matthew 15:29
.
And a great multitude came to Him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the dumb, and many others, and they put them down at His feet; and He cured them, -- matthew 15:30
.
So that the crowd was amazed when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they recognized and praised and thanked and glorified the God of Israel. -- matthew 15:31
.
Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, I have pity and sympathy and am deeply moved for the crowd, because they have been with Me now three days and they have nothing [at all left] to eat; and I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint or become exhausted on the way. -- matthew 15:32
.
And the disciples said to Him, Where are we to get bread sufficient to feed so great a crowd in this isolated and desert place? -- matthew 15:33
.
And Jesus asked them, How many loaves of bread do you have? They replied, Seven, and a few small fish. -- matthew 15:34
.
And ordering the crowd to recline on the ground, -- matthew 15:35
.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and when He had given thanks, He broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. -- matthew 15:36
.
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they gathered up seven [large provision] baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. -- matthew 15:37
.
Those who ate were 4,men, not including the women and the children. -- matthew 15:38
.
Then He dismissed the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the district of Magadan. -- matthew 15:39
.
NOW THE Pharisees and Sadducees came up to Jesus, and they asked Him to show them a sign (spectacular miracle) from heaven [attesting His divine authority]. -- matthew 16:1
.
He replied to them, When it is evening you say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red, -- matthew 16:2
.
And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and has a gloomy and threatening look. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. -- matthew 16:3
.
A wicked and morally unfaithful generation craves a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Then He left them and went away. -- matthew 16:4
.
When the disciples reached the other side of the sea, they found that they had forgotten to bring any bread. -- matthew 16:5
.
Jesus said to them, Be careful and on your guard against the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees and Sadducees. -- matthew 16:6
.
And they reasoned among themselves about it, saying, It is because we did not bring any bread. -- matthew 16:7
.
But Jesus, aware of this, asked, Why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? O you [men, how little trust you have in Me, how] little faith! -- matthew 16:8
.
Do you not yet discern (perceive and understand)? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many [small hand] baskets you gathered? -- matthew 16:9
.
Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many [large provision] baskets you took up? -- matthew 16:10
.
How is it that you fail to understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But beware of the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees and Sadducees. -- matthew 16:11
.
Then they discerned that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. -- matthew 16:12
.
Now when Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, Who do people say that the Son of Man is? -- matthew 16:13
.
And they answered, Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. -- matthew 16:14
.
He said to them, But who do you [yourselves] say that I am? -- matthew 16:15
.
Simon Peter replied, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. -- matthew 16:16
.
Then Jesus answered him, Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are you, Simon Bar-Jonah. For flesh and blood [men] have not revealed this to you, but My Father Who is in heaven. -- matthew 16:17
.
And I tell you, you are Peter [Greek, Petros--a large piece of rock], and on this rock [Greek, petra--a huge rock like Gibraltar] I will build My church, and the gates of Hades (the powers of the infernal region) shall not overpower it [or be strong to its detriment or hold out against it]. -- matthew 16:18
.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind (declare to be improper and unlawful) on earth must be what is already bound in heaven; and whatever you loose (declare lawful) on earth must be what is already loosed in heaven. -- matthew 16:19
.
Then He sternly and strictly charged and warned the disciples to tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ. -- matthew 16:20
.
From that time forth Jesus began [clearly] to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and the high priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised from death. -- matthew 16:21
.
Then Peter took Him aside to speak to Him privately and began to reprove and charge Him sharply, saying, God forbid, Lord! This must never happen to You! -- matthew 16:22
.
But Jesus turned away from Peter and said to him, Get behind Me, Satan! You are in My way [an offense and a hindrance and a snare to Me]; for you are minding what partakes not of the nature and quality of God, but of men. -- matthew 16:23
.
Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to be My disciple, let him deny himself [disregard, lose sight of, and forget himself and his own interests] and take up his cross and follow Me [cleave steadfastly to Me, conform wholly to My example in living and, if need be, in dying, also]. -- matthew 16:24
.
For whoever is bent on saving his [temporal] life [his comfort and security here] shall lose it [eternal life]; and whoever loses his life [his comfort and security here] for My sake shall find it [life everlasting]. -- matthew 16:25
.
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life [his blessed life in the kingdom of God]? Or what would a man give as an exchange for his [blessed] life [in the kingdom of God]? -- matthew 16:26
.
For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory (majesty, splendor) of His Father with His angels, and then He will render account and reward every man in accordance with what he has done. -- matthew 16:27
.
Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in (into) His kingdom. -- matthew 16:28
.
AND SIX days after this, Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. -- matthew 17:1
.
And His appearance underwent a change in their presence; and His face shone clear and bright like the sun, and His clothing became as white as light. -- matthew 17:2
.
And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, who kept talking with Him. -- matthew 17:3
.
Then Peter began to speak and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good and delightful that we are here; if You approve, I will put up three booths here--one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah. -- matthew 17:4
.
While he was still speaking, behold, a shining cloud [composed of light] overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, This is My Son, My Beloved, with Whom I am [and have always been] delighted. Listen to Him! -- matthew 17:5
.
When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were seized with alarm and struck with fear. -- matthew 17:6
.
But Jesus came and touched them and said, Get up, and do not be afraid. -- matthew 17:7
.
And when they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. -- matthew 17:8
.
And as they were going down the mountain, Jesus cautioned and commanded them, Do not mention to anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead. -- matthew 17:9
.
The disciples asked Him, Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first? -- matthew 17:10
.
He replied, Elijah does come and will get everything restored and ready. -- matthew 17:11
.
But I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know or recognize him, but did to him as they liked. So also the Son of Man is going to be treated and suffer at their hands. -- matthew 17:12
.
Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist. -- matthew 17:13
.
And when they approached the multitude, a man came up to Him, kneeling before Him and saying, -- matthew 17:14
.
Lord, do pity and have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy (is moonstruck) and he suffers terribly; for frequently he falls into the fire and many times into the water. -- matthew 17:15
.
And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to cure him. -- matthew 17:16
.
And Jesus answered, O you unbelieving (warped, wayward, rebellious) and thoroughly perverse generation! How long am I to remain with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to Me. -- matthew 17:17
.
And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured instantly. -- matthew 17:18
.
Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked privately, Why could we not drive it out? -- matthew 17:19
.
He said to them, Because of the littleness of your faith [that is, your lack of firmly relying trust]. For truly I say to you, if you have faith [that is living] like a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, Move from here to yonder place, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you. -- matthew 17:20
.
But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting. -- matthew 17:21
.
When they were going about here and there in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is going to be turned over into the hands of men. -- matthew 17:22
.
And they will kill Him, and He will be raised [to life] again on the third day. And they were deeply and exceedingly grieved and distressed. -- matthew 17:23
.
When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the half shekel [the temple tax] went up to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the half shekel? -- matthew 17:24
.
He answered, Yes. And when he came home, Jesus spoke to him [about it] first, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly rulers collect duties or tribute--from their own sons or from others not of their own family? -- matthew 17:25
.
And when Peter said, From other people not of their own family, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are exempt. -- matthew 17:26
.
However, in order not to give offense and cause them to stumble [that is, to cause them to judge unfavorably and unjustly] go down to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find there a shekel. Take it and give it to them to pay the temple tax for Me and for yourself. -- matthew 17:27
.
AT THAT time the disciples came up and asked Jesus, Who then is [really] the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? -- matthew 18:1
.
And He called a little child to Himself and put him in the midst of them, -- matthew 18:2
.
And said, Truly I say to you, unless you repent (change, turn about) and become like little children [trusting, lowly, loving, forgiving], you can never enter the kingdom of heaven [at all]. -- matthew 18:3
.
Whoever will humble himself therefore and become like this little child [trusting, lowly, loving, forgiving] is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 18:4
.
And whoever receives and accepts and welcomes one little child like this for My sake and in My name receives and accepts and welcomes Me. -- matthew 18:5
.
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin [that is, who entices him or hinders him in right conduct or thought], it would be better (more expedient and profitable or advantageous) for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea. -- matthew 18:6
.
Woe to the world for such temptations to sin and influences to do wrong! It is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the person on whose account or by whom the temptation comes! -- matthew 18:7
.
And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble and sin, cut it off and throw it away from you; it is better (more profitable and wholesome) for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire. -- matthew 18:8
.
And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you; it is better (more profitable and wholesome) for you to enter life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell (Gehenna) of fire. -- matthew 18:9
.
Beware that you do not despise or feel scornful toward or think little of one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always are in the presence of and look upon the face of My Father Who is in heaven. -- matthew 18:10
.
For the Son of man came to save [from the penalty of eternal death] that which was lost. -- matthew 18:11
.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray and gets lost, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost? -- matthew 18:12
.
And if it should be that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost. -- matthew 18:13
.
Just so it is not the will of My Father Who is in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost and perish. -- matthew 18:14
.
If your brother wrongs you, go and show him his fault, between you and him privately. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother. -- matthew 18:15
.
But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two others, so that every word may be confirmed and upheld by the testimony of two or three witnesses. -- matthew 18:16
.
If he pays no attention to them [refusing to listen and obey], tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector. -- matthew 18:17
.
Truly I tell you, whatever you forbid and declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is already forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit and declare proper and lawful on earth must be what is already permitted in heaven. -- matthew 18:18
.
Again I tell you, if two of you on earth agree (harmonize together, make a symphony together) about whatever [anything and everything] they may ask, it will come to pass and be done for them by My Father in heaven. -- matthew 18:19
.
For wherever two or three are gathered (drawn together as My followers) in (into) My name, there I AM in the midst of them. -- matthew 18:20
.
Then Peter came up to Him and said, Lord, how many times may my brother sin against me and I forgive him and let it go? [As many as] up to seven times? -- matthew 18:21
.
Jesus answered him, I tell you, not up to seven times, but seventy times seven! -- matthew 18:22
.
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a human king who wished to settle accounts with his attendants. -- matthew 18:23
.
When he began the accounting, one was brought to him who owed him 10,talents [probably about $10,000,000], -- matthew 18:24
.
And because he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed, and payment to be made. -- matthew 18:25
.
So the attendant fell on his knees, begging him, Have patience with me and I will pay you everything. -- matthew 18:26
.
And his master's heart was moved with compassion, and he released him and forgave him [cancelling] the debt. -- matthew 18:27
.
But that same attendant, as he went out, found one of his fellow attendants who owed him a hundred denarii [about twenty dollars]; and he caught him by the throat and said, Pay what you owe! -- matthew 18:28
.
So his fellow attendant fell down and begged him earnestly, Give me time, and I will pay you all ! -- matthew 18:29
.
But he was unwilling, and he went out and had him put in prison till he should pay the debt. -- matthew 18:30
.
When his fellow attendants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and told everything that had taken place to their master. -- matthew 18:31
.
Then his master called him and said to him, You contemptible and wicked attendant! I forgave and cancelled all that [great] debt of yours because you begged me to. -- matthew 18:32
.
And should you not have had pity and mercy on your fellow attendant, as I had pity and mercy on you? -- matthew 18:33
.
And in wrath his master turned him over to the torturers (the jailers), till he should pay all that he owed. -- matthew 18:34
.
So also My heavenly Father will deal with every one of you if you do not freely forgive your brother from your heart his offenses. -- matthew 18:35
.
NOW WHEN Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went into the part of Judea that is beyond the Jordan; -- matthew 19:1
.
And great throngs accompanied Him, and He cured them there. -- matthew 19:2
.
And Pharisees came to Him and put Him to the test by asking, Is it lawful and right to dismiss and repudiate and divorce one's wife for any and every cause? -- matthew 19:3
.
He replied, Have you never read that He Who made them from the beginning made them male and female, -- matthew 19:4
.
And said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united firmly (joined inseparably) to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh? -- matthew 19:5
.
So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder (separate). -- matthew 19:6
.
They said to Him, Why then did Moses command [us] to give a certificate of divorce and thus to dismiss and repudiate a wife? -- matthew 19:7
.
He said to them, Because of the hardness (stubbornness and perversity) of your hearts Moses permitted you to dismiss and repudiate and divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been so [ordained]. -- matthew 19:8
.
I say to you: whoever dismisses (repudiates, divorces) his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. -- matthew 19:9
.
The disciples said to Him, If the case of a man with his wife is like this, it is neither profitable nor advisable to marry. -- matthew 19:10
.
But He said to them, Not all men can accept this saying, but it is for those to whom [the capacity to receive] it has been given. -- matthew 19:11
.
For there are eunuchs who have been born incapable of marriage; and there are eunuchs who have been made so by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves incapable of marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who is able to accept this accept it. -- matthew 19:12
.
Then little children were brought to Jesus, that He might put His hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. -- matthew 19:13
.
But He said, Leave the children alone! Allow the little ones to come to Me, and do not forbid or restrain or hinder them, for of such [as these] is the kingdom of heaven composed. -- matthew 19:14
.
And He put His hands upon them, and then went on His way. -- matthew 19:15
.
And behold, there came a man up to Him, saying, Teacher, what excellent and perfectly and essentially good deed must I do to possess eternal life? -- matthew 19:16
.
And He said to him, Why do you ask Me about the perfectly and essentially good? There is only One Who is good [perfectly and essentially]--God. If you would enter into the Life, you must continually keep the commandments. -- matthew 19:17
.
He said to Him, What sort of commandments? [Or, which ones?] And Jesus answered, You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, -- matthew 19:18
.
Honor your father and your mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself. -- matthew 19:19
.
The young man said, I have observed all these from my youth; what still do I lack? -- matthew 19:20
.
Jesus answered him, If you would be perfect [that is, have that spiritual maturity which accompanies self-sacrificing character], go and sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven; and come, be My disciple [side with My party and follow Me]. -- matthew 19:21
.
But when the young man heard this, he went away sad (grieved and in much distress), for he had great possessions. -- matthew 19:22
.
And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, it will be difficult for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 19:23
.
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 19:24
.
When the disciples heard this, they were utterly puzzled (astonished, bewildered), saying, Who then can be saved [from eternal death]? -- matthew 19:25
.
But Jesus looked at them and said, With men this is impossible, but all things are possible with God. -- matthew 19:26
.
Then Peter answered Him, saying, Behold, we have left [our] all and have become Your disciples [sided with Your party and followed You]. What then shall we receive? -- matthew 19:27
.
Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, in the new age [the Messianic rebirth of the world], when the Son of Man shall sit down on the throne of His glory, you who have [become My disciples, sided with My party and] followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. -- matthew 19:28
.
And anyone and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My name's sake will receive many [even a hundred] times more and will inherit eternal life. -- matthew 19:29
.
But many who [now] are first will be last [then], and many who [now] are last will be first [then]. -- matthew 19:30
.
FOR THE kingdom of heaven is like the owner of an estate who went out in the morning along with the dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard. -- matthew 20:1
.
After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. -- matthew 20:2
.
And going out about the third hour (nine o'clock), he saw others standing idle in the marketplace; -- matthew 20:3
.
And he said to them, You go also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will pay you. And they went. -- matthew 20:4
.
He went out again about the sixth hour (noon), and the ninth hour (three o'clock) he did the same. -- matthew 20:5
.
And about the eleventh hour (five o'clock) he went out and found still others standing around, and said to them, Why do you stand here idle all day? -- matthew 20:6
.
They answered him, Because nobody has hired us. He told them, You go out into the vineyard also and you will get whatever is just and fair. -- matthew 20:7
.
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first. -- matthew 20:8
.
And those who had been hired at the eleventh hour (five o'clock) came and received a denarius each. -- matthew 20:9
.
Now when the first came, they supposed they would get more, but each of them also received a denarius. -- matthew 20:10
.
And when they received it, they grumbled at the owner of the estate, -- matthew 20:11
.
Saying, These [men] who came last worked no more than an hour, and yet you have made them rank with us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day. -- matthew 20:12
.
But he answered one of them, Friend, I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? -- matthew 20:13
.
Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this man hired last the same as I give to you. -- matthew 20:14
.
Am I not permitted to do what I choose with what is mine? [Or do you begrudge my being generous?] Is your eye evil because I am good? -- matthew 20:15
.
So those who [now] are last will be first [then], and those who [now] are first will be last [then]. For many are called, but few chosen. -- matthew 20:16
.
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside along the way and said to them, -- matthew 20:17
.
Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes; and they will sentence Him to death -- matthew 20:18
.
And deliver Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and whipped and crucified, and He will be raised [to life] on the third day. -- matthew 20:19
.
Then the mother of Zebedee's children came up to Him with her sons and, kneeling, worshiped Him and asked a favor of Him. -- matthew 20:20
.
And He asked her, What do you wish? She answered Him, Give orders that these two sons of mine may sit, one at Your right hand and one at Your left in Your kingdom. -- matthew 20:21
.
But Jesus replied, You do not realize what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? They answered, We are able. -- matthew 20:22
.
He said to them, You will drink My cup, but seats at My right hand and at My left are not Mine to give, but they are for those for whom they have been ordained and prepared by My Father. -- matthew 20:23
.
But when the ten [other disciples] heard this, they were indignant at the two brothers. -- matthew 20:24
.
And Jesus called them to Him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men hold them in subjection [tyrannizing over them]. -- matthew 20:25
.
Not so shall it be among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant, -- matthew 20:26
.
And whoever desires to be first among you must be your slave-- -- matthew 20:27
.
Just as the Son of Man came not to be waited on but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many [the price paid to set them free]. -- matthew 20:28
.
And as they were going out of Jericho, a great throng accompanied Him. -- matthew 20:29
.
And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, Lord, have pity and mercy on us, [You] Son of David! -- matthew 20:30
.
The crowds reproved them and told them to keep still; but they cried out all the more, Lord, have pity and mercy on us, [You] Son of David! -- matthew 20:31
.
And Jesus stopped and called them, and asked, What do you want Me to do for you? -- matthew 20:32
.
They answered Him, Lord, we want our eyes to be opened! -- matthew 20:33
.
And Jesus, in pity, touched their eyes; and instantly they received their sight and followed Him. -- matthew 20:34
.
AND WHEN they came near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples on ahead, -- matthew 21:1
.
Saying to them, Go into the village that is opposite you, and at once you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie [them] and bring [them] to Me. -- matthew 21:2
.
If anyone says anything to you, you shall reply, The Lord needs them, and he will let them go without delay. -- matthew 21:3
.
This happened that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, -- matthew 21:4
.
Say to the Daughter of Zion [inhabitants of Jerusalem], Behold, your King is coming to you, lowly and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey [a beast of burden]. -- matthew 21:5
.
Then the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. -- matthew 21:6
.
They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their coats upon them, and He seated Himself on them [the clothing]. -- matthew 21:7
.
And most of the crowd kept spreading their garments on the road, and others kept cutting branches from the trees and scattering them on the road. -- matthew 21:8
.
And the crowds that went ahead of Him and those that followed Him kept shouting, Hosanna (O be propitious, graciously inclined) to the Son of David, [the Messiah]! Blessed (praised, glorified) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna (O be favorably disposed) in the highest [heaven]! -- matthew 21:9
.
And when He entered Jerusalem, all the city became agitated and [trembling with excitement] said, Who is This? -- matthew 21:10
.
And the crowds replied, This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee. -- matthew 21:11
.
And Jesus went into the temple (whole temple enclosure) and drove out all who bought and sold in the sacred place, and He turned over the four-footed tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who sold doves. -- matthew 21:12
.
He said to them, The Scripture says, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers. -- matthew 21:13
.
And the blind and the lame came to Him in the porches and courts of the temple, and He cured them. -- matthew 21:14
.
But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He did and the boys and the girls and the youths and the maidens crying out in the porches and courts of the temple, Hosanna (O be propitious, graciously inclined) to the Son of David! they were indignant. -- matthew 21:15
.
And they said to Him, Do You hear what these are saying? And Jesus replied to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouths of babes and unweaned infants You have made (provided) perfect praise? -- matthew 21:16
.
And leaving them, He departed from the city and went out to Bethany and lodged there. -- matthew 21:17
.
In the early dawn the next morning, as He was coming back to the city, He was hungry. -- matthew 21:18
.
And as He saw one single leafy fig tree above the roadside, He went to it but He found nothing but leaves on it [seeing that in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves]. And He said to it, Never again shall fruit grow on you! And the fig tree withered up at once. -- matthew 21:19
.
When the disciples saw it, they marveled greatly and asked, How is it that the fig tree has withered away all at once? -- matthew 21:20
.
And Jesus answered them, Truly I say to you, if you have faith (a firm relying trust) and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will be done. -- matthew 21:21
.
And whatever you ask for in prayer, having faith and [really] believing, you will receive. -- matthew 21:22
.
And when He entered the sacred enclosure of the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him as He was teaching and said, By what power of authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this power of authority? -- matthew 21:23
.
Jesus answered them, I also will ask you a question, and if you give Me the answer, then I also will tell you by what power of authority I do these things. -- matthew 21:24
.
The baptism of John--from where was it? From heaven or from men? And they reasoned and argued with one another, If we say, From heaven, He will ask us, Why then did you not believe him? -- matthew 21:25
.
But if we say, From men--we are afraid of and must reckon with the multitude, for they all regard John as a prophet. -- matthew 21:26
.
So they answered Jesus, We do not know. And He said to them, Neither will I tell you by what power of authority I do these things. -- matthew 21:27
.
What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He came to the first and said, Son, go and work today in the vineyard. -- matthew 21:28
.
And he answered, I will not; but afterward he changed his mind and went. -- matthew 21:29
.
Then the man came to the second and said the same [thing]. And he replied, I will [go], sir; but he did not go. -- matthew 21:30
.
Which of the two did the will of the father? They replied, The first one. Jesus said to them, Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the harlots will get into the kingdom of heaven before you. -- matthew 21:31
.
For John came to you walking in the way of an upright man in right standing with God, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots did believe him; and you, even when you saw that, did not afterward change your minds and believe him [adhere to, trust in, and rely on what he told you]. -- matthew 21:32
.
Listen to another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a wine vat in it and built a watchtower. Then he let it out [for rent] to tenants and went into another country. -- matthew 21:33
.
When the fruit season drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his [share of the] fruit. -- matthew 21:34
.
But the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. -- matthew 21:35
.
Again he sent other servants, more than the first time, and they treated them the same way. -- matthew 21:36
.
Finally he sent his own son to them, saying, They will respect and give heed to my son. -- matthew 21:37
.
But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, This is the heir; come on, let us kill him and have his inheritance. -- matthew 21:38
.
And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. -- matthew 21:39
.
Now when the owner of the vineyard comes back, what will he do to those tenants? -- matthew 21:40
.
They said to Him, He will put those wretches to a miserable death and rent the vineyard to other tenants of such a character that they will give him the fruits promptly in their season. -- matthew 21:41
.
Jesus asked them, Have you never read in the Scriptures: The very Stone which the builders rejected and threw away has become the Cornerstone; this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes? -- matthew 21:42
.
I tell you, for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce the fruits of it. -- matthew 21:43
.
And whoever falls on this Stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom It falls will be crushed to powder [and It will winnow him, scattering him like dust]. -- matthew 21:44
.
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables (comparisons, stories used to illustrate and explain), they perceived that He was talking about them. -- matthew 21:45
.
And although they were trying to arrest Him, they feared the throngs because they regarded Him as a prophet. -- matthew 21:46
.
AND AGAIN Jesus spoke to them in parables (comparisons, stories used to illustrate and explain), saying, -- matthew 22:1
.
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son -- matthew 22:2
.
And sent his servants to summon those who had been invited to the wedding banquet, but they refused to come. -- matthew 22:3
.
Again he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my banquet; my bullocks and my fat calves are killed, and everything is prepared; come to the wedding feast. -- matthew 22:4
.
But they were not concerned and paid no attention [they ignored and made light of the summons, treating it with contempt] and they went away--one to his farm, another to his business, -- matthew 22:5
.
While the others seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and put them to death. -- matthew 22:6
.
[Hearing this] the king was infuriated; and he sent his soldiers and put those murderers to death and burned their city. -- matthew 22:7
.
Then he said to his servants, The wedding [feast] is prepared, but those invited were not worthy. -- matthew 22:8
.
So go to the thoroughfares where they leave the city [where the main roads and those from the country end] and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find. -- matthew 22:9
.
And those servants went out on the crossroads and got together as many as they found, both bad and good, so [the room in which] the wedding feast [was held] was filled with guests. -- matthew 22:10
.
But when the king came in to view the guests, he looked intently at a man there who had on no wedding garment. -- matthew 22:11
.
And he said, Friend, how did you come in here without putting on the [appropriate] wedding garment? And he was speechless (muzzled, gagged). -- matthew 22:12
.
Then the king said to the attendants, Tie him hand and foot, and throw him into the darkness outside; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. -- matthew 22:13
.
For many are called (invited and summoned), but few are chosen. -- matthew 22:14
.
Then the Pharisees went and consulted and plotted together how they might entangle Jesus in His talk. -- matthew 22:15
.
And they sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are sincere and what You profess to be and that You teach the way of God truthfully, regardless of consequences and being afraid of no man; for You are impartial and do not regard either the person or the position of anyone. -- matthew 22:16
.
Tell us then what You think about this: Is it lawful to pay tribute [levied on individuals and to be paid yearly] to Caesar or not? -- matthew 22:17
.
But Jesus, aware of their malicious plot, asked, Why do you put Me to the test and try to entrap Me, you pretenders (hypocrites)? -- matthew 22:18
.
Show me the money used for the tribute. And they brought Him a denarius. -- matthew 22:19
.
And Jesus said to them, Whose likeness and title are these? -- matthew 22:20
.
They said, Caesar's. Then He said to them, Pay therefore to Caesar the things that are due to Caesar, and pay to God the things that are due to God. -- matthew 22:21
.
When they heard it they were amazed and marveled; and they left Him and departed. -- matthew 22:22
.
The same day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection [of the dead], came to Him and they asked Him a question, -- matthew 22:23
.
Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man dies, leaving no children, his brother shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother. -- matthew 22:24
.
Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married and died, and, having no children, left his wife to his brother. -- matthew 22:25
.
The second also died childless, and the third, down to the seventh. -- matthew 22:26
.
Last of all, the woman died also. -- matthew 22:27
.
Now, in the resurrection, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her. -- matthew 22:28
.
But Jesus replied to them, You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor God's power. -- matthew 22:29
.
For in the resurrected state neither do [men] marry nor are [women] given in marriage, but they are like the angels in heaven. -- matthew 22:30
.
But as to the resurrection of the dead--have you never read what was said to you by God, -- matthew 22:31
.
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living! -- matthew 22:32
.
And when the throng heard it, they were astonished and filled with [glad] amazement at His teaching. -- matthew 22:33
.
Now when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced (muzzled) the Sadducees, they gathered together. -- matthew 22:34
.
And one of their number, a lawyer, asked Him a question to test Him. -- matthew 22:35
.
Teacher, which kind of commandment is great and important (the principal kind) in the Law? [Some commandments are light--which are heavy?] -- matthew 22:36
.
And He replied to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind (intellect). -- matthew 22:37
.
This is the great (most important, principal) and first commandment. -- matthew 22:38
.
And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself. -- matthew 22:39
.
These two commandments sum up and upon them depend all the Law and the Prophets. -- matthew 22:40
.
Now while the Pharisees were still assembled there, Jesus asked them a question, -- matthew 22:41
.
Saying, What do you think of the Christ? Whose Son is He? They said to Him, The Son of David. -- matthew 22:42
.
He said to them, How is it then that David, under the influence of the [Holy] Spirit, calls Him Lord, saying, -- matthew 22:43
.
The Lord said to My Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet? -- matthew 22:44
.
If then David thus calls Him Lord, how is He his Son? -- matthew 22:45
.
And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day did anyone venture or dare to question Him. -- matthew 22:46
.
THEN JESUS said to the multitudes and to His disciples, -- matthew 23:1
.
The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat [of authority]. -- matthew 23:2
.
So observe and practice all they tell you; but do not do what they do, for they preach, but do not practice. -- matthew 23:3
.
They tie up heavy loads, hard to bear, and place them on men's shoulders, but they themselves will not lift a finger to help bear them. -- matthew 23:4
.
They do all their works to be seen of men; for they make wide their phylacteries (small cases enclosing certain Scripture passages, worn during prayer on the left arm and forehead) and make long their fringes [worn by all male Israelites, according to the command]. -- matthew 23:5
.
And they take pleasure in and [thus] love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues, -- matthew 23:6
.
And to be greeted with honor in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi. -- matthew 23:7
.
But you are not to be called rabbi (teacher), for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers. -- matthew 23:8
.
And do not call anyone [in the church] on earth father, for you have one Father, Who is in heaven. -- matthew 23:9
.
And you must not be called masters (leaders), for you have one Master (Leader), the Christ. -- matthew 23:10
.
He who is greatest among you shall be your servant. -- matthew 23:11
.
Whoever exalts himself [with haughtiness and empty pride] shall be humbled (brought low), and whoever humbles himself [whoever has a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly] shall be raised to honor. -- matthew 23:12
.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, pretenders (hypocrites)! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces; for you neither enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are about to go in to do so. -- matthew 23:13
.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, pretenders (hypocrites)! For you swallow up widows' houses and for a pretense to cover it up make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation and the heavier sentence. -- matthew 23:14
.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, pretenders (hypocrites)! For you travel over sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes one [a proselyte], you make him doubly as much a child of hell (Gehenna) as you are. -- matthew 23:15
.
Woe to you, blind guides, who say, If anyone swears by the sanctuary of the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the sanctuary, he is a debtor [bound by his oath]. -- matthew 23:16
.
You blind fools! For which is greater: the gold, or the sanctuary of the temple that has made the gold sacred? -- matthew 23:17
.
You say too, Whoever swears by the altar is not duty bound; but whoever swears by the offering on the altar, his oath is binding. -- matthew 23:18
.
You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar which makes the gift sacred? -- matthew 23:19
.
So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. -- matthew 23:20
.
And he who swears by the sanctuary of the temple swears by it and by Him Who dwells in it. [I Kings 8:13; Ps. 26:8.] -- matthew 23:21
.
And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him Who sits upon it. -- matthew 23:22
.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, pretenders (hypocrites)! For you give a tenth of your mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected and omitted the weightier (more important) matters of the Law--right and justice and mercy and fidelity. These you ought [particularly] to have done, without neglecting the others. -- matthew 23:23
.
You blind guides, filtering out a gnat and gulping down a camel! -- matthew 23:24
.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, pretenders (hypocrites)! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but within they are full of extortion (prey, spoil, plunder) and grasping self-indulgence. -- matthew 23:25
.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may be clean also. -- matthew 23:26
.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, pretenders (hypocrites)! For you are like tombs that have been whitewashed, which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead men's bones and everything impure. -- matthew 23:27
.
Just so, you also outwardly seem to people to be just and upright but inside you are full of pretense and lawlessness and iniquity. -- matthew 23:28
.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, pretenders (hypocrites)! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, -- matthew 23:29
.
Saying, If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have aided them in shedding the blood of the prophets. -- matthew 23:30
.
Thus you are testifying against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. -- matthew 23:31
.
Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers' sins to the brim [so that nothing may be wanting to a full measure]. -- matthew 23:32
.
You serpents! You spawn of vipers! How can you escape the penalty to be suffered in hell (Gehenna)? -- matthew 23:33
.
Because of this, take notice: I am sending you prophets and wise men (interpreters and teachers) and scribes (men learned in the Mosaic Law and the Prophets); some of them you will kill, even crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue and persecute from town to town, -- matthew 23:34
.
So that upon your heads may come all the blood of the righteous (those who correspond to the divine standard of right) shed on earth, from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar [of burnt offering]. -- matthew 23:35
.
Truly I declare to you, all these [evil, calamitous times] will come upon this generation. [II Chron. 36:15, 16.] -- matthew 23:36
.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, murdering the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a mother fowl gathers her brood under her wings, and you refused! -- matthew 23:37
.
Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate (abandoned and left destitute of God's help). [I Kings 9:7; Jer. 22:5.] -- matthew 23:38
.
For I declare to you, you will not see Me again until you say, Blessed (magnified in worship, adored, and exalted) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord! -- matthew 23:39
.
JESUS DEPARTED from the temple area and was going on His way when His disciples came up to Him to call His attention to the buildings of the temple and point them out to Him. -- matthew 24:1
.
But He answered them, Do you see all these? Truly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down. -- matthew 24:2
.
While He was seated on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately and said, Tell us, when will this take place, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end (the completion, the consummation) of the age? -- matthew 24:3
.
Jesus answered them, Be careful that no one misleads you [deceiving you and leading you into error]. -- matthew 24:4
.
For many will come in (on the strength of) My name [appropriating the name which belongs to Me], saying, I am the Christ (the Messiah), and they will lead many astray. -- matthew 24:5
.
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not frightened or troubled, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. -- matthew 24:6
.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in place after place; -- matthew 24:7
.
All this is but the beginning [the early pains] of the birth pangs [of the intolerable anguish]. -- matthew 24:8
.
Then they will hand you over to suffer affliction and tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake. -- matthew 24:9
.
And then many will be offended and repelled and will begin to distrust and desert [Him Whom they ought to trust and obey] and will stumble and fall away and betray one another and pursue one another with hatred. -- matthew 24:10
.
And many false prophets will rise up and deceive and lead many into error. -- matthew 24:11
.
And the love of the great body of people will grow cold because of the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity, -- matthew 24:12
.
But he who endures to the end will be saved. -- matthew 24:13
.
And this good news of the kingdom (the Gospel) will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then will come the end. -- matthew 24:14
.
So when you see the appalling sacrilege [the abomination that astonishes and makes desolate], spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy Place--let the reader take notice and ponder and consider and heed [this]-- -- matthew 24:15
.
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; -- matthew 24:16
.
Let him who is on the housetop not come down and go into the house to take anything; -- matthew 24:17
.
And let him who is in the field not turn back to get his overcoat. -- matthew 24:18
.
And alas for the women who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days! -- matthew 24:19
.
Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. -- matthew 24:20
.
For then there will be great tribulation (affliction, distress, and oppression) such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now--no, and never will be [again]. -- matthew 24:21
.
And if those days had not been shortened, no human being would endure and survive, but for the sake of the elect (God's chosen ones) those days will be shortened. -- matthew 24:22
.
If anyone says to you then, Behold, here is the Christ (the Messiah)! or, There He is!--do not believe it. -- matthew 24:23
.
For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will show great signs and wonders so as to deceive and lead astray, if possible, even the elect (God's chosen ones). -- matthew 24:24
.
See, I have warned you beforehand. -- matthew 24:25
.
So if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness (desert)--do not go out there; if they tell you, Behold, He is in the secret places or inner rooms--do not believe it. -- matthew 24:26
.
For just as the lightning flashes from the east and shines and is seen as far as the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. -- matthew 24:27
.
Wherever there is a fallen body (a corpse), there the vultures (or eagles) will flock together. -- matthew 24:28
.
Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. -- matthew 24:29
.
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and beat their breasts and lament in anguish, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory [in brilliancy and splendor]. -- matthew 24:30
.
And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect (His chosen ones) from the four winds, [even] from one end of the universe to the other. -- matthew 24:31
.
From the fig tree learn this lesson: as soon as its young shoots become soft and tender and it puts out its leaves, you know of a surety that summer is near. -- matthew 24:32
.
So also when you see these signs, all taken together, coming to pass, you may know of a surety that He is near, at the very doors. -- matthew 24:33
.
Truly I tell you, this generation (the whole multitude of people living at the same time, in a definite, given period) will not pass away till all these things taken together take place. -- matthew 24:34
.
Sky and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. -- matthew 24:35
.
But of that [exact] day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. -- matthew 24:36
.
As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. -- matthew 24:37
.
For just as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, [men] marrying and [women] being given in marriage, until the [very] day when Noah went into the ark, -- matthew 24:38
.
And they did not know or understand until the flood came and swept them all away--so will be the coming of the Son of Man. -- matthew 24:39
.
At that time two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. -- matthew 24:40
.
Two women will be grinding at the hand mill; one will be taken and one will be left. -- matthew 24:41
.
Watch therefore [give strict attention, be cautious and active], for you do not know in what kind of a day [whether a near or remote one] your Lord is coming. -- matthew 24:42
.
But understand this: had the householder known in what [part of the night, whether in a night or a morning] watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be undermined and broken into. -- matthew 24:43
.
You also must be ready therefore, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him. -- matthew 24:44
.
Who then is the faithful, thoughtful, and wise servant, whom his master has put in charge of his household to give to the others the food and supplies at the proper time? -- matthew 24:45
.
Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) is that servant whom, when his master comes, he will find so doing. -- matthew 24:46
.
I solemnly declare to you, he will set him over all his possessions. -- matthew 24:47
.
But if that servant is wicked and says to himself, My master is delayed and is going to be gone a long time, -- matthew 24:48
.
And begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken, -- matthew 24:49
.
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he is not aware, -- matthew 24:50
.
And will punish him [cut him up by scourging] and put him with the pretenders (hypocrites); there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. -- matthew 24:51
.
THEN THE kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. -- matthew 25:1
.
Five of them were foolish (thoughtless, without forethought) and five were wise (sensible, intelligent, and prudent). -- matthew 25:2
.
For when the foolish took their lamps, they did not take any [extra] oil with them; -- matthew 25:3
.
But the wise took flasks of oil along with them [also] with their lamps. -- matthew 25:4
.
While the bridegroom lingered and was slow in coming, they all began nodding their heads, and they fell asleep. -- matthew 25:5
.
But at midnight there was a shout, Behold, the bridegroom! Go out to meet him! -- matthew 25:6
.
Then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order. -- matthew 25:7
.
And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. -- matthew 25:8
.
But the wise replied, There will not be enough for us and for you; go instead to the dealers and buy for yourselves. -- matthew 25:9
.
But while they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were prepared went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. -- matthew 25:10
.
Later the other virgins also came and said, Lord, Lord, open [the door] to us! -- matthew 25:11
.
But He replied, I solemnly declare to you, I do not know you [I am not acquainted with you]. -- matthew 25:12
.
Watch therefore [give strict attention and be cautious and active], for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come. -- matthew 25:13
.
For it is like a man who was about to take a long journey, and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his property. -- matthew 25:14
.
To one he gave five talents [probably about $5,000], to another two, to another one--to each in proportion to his own personal ability. Then he departed and left the country. -- matthew 25:15
.
He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he gained five talents more. -- matthew 25:16
.
And likewise he who had received the two talents--he also gained two talents more. -- matthew 25:17
.
But he who had received the one talent went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. -- matthew 25:18
.
Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. -- matthew 25:19
.
And he who had received the five talents came and brought him five more, saying, Master, you entrusted to me five talents; see, here I have gained five talents more. -- matthew 25:20
.
His master said to him, Well done, you upright (honorable, admirable) and faithful servant! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into and share the joy (the delight, the blessedness) which your master enjoys. -- matthew 25:21
.
And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you entrusted two talents to me; here I have gained two talents more. -- matthew 25:22
.
His master said to him, Well done, you upright (honorable, admirable) and faithful servant! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into and share the joy (the delight, the blessedness) which your master enjoys. -- matthew 25:23
.
He who had received one talent also came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a harsh and hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you had not winnowed [the grain]. -- matthew 25:24
.
So I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is your own. -- matthew 25:25
.
But his master answered him, You wicked and lazy and idle servant! Did you indeed know that I reap where I have not sowed and gather [grain] where I have not winnowed? -- matthew 25:26
.
Then you should have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received what was my own with interest. -- matthew 25:27
.
So take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. -- matthew 25:28
.
For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will be furnished richly so that he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have will be taken away. -- matthew 25:29
.
And throw the good-for-nothing servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. -- matthew 25:30
.
When the Son of Man comes in His glory (His majesty and splendor), and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. -- matthew 25:31
.
All nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them [the people] from one another as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats; -- matthew 25:32
.
And He will cause the sheep to stand at His right hand, but the goats at His left. -- matthew 25:33
.
Then the King will say to those at His right hand, Come, you blessed of My Father [you favored of God and appointed to eternal salvation], inherit (receive as your own) the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. -- matthew 25:34
.
For I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you brought Me together with yourselves and welcomed and entertained and lodged Me, -- matthew 25:35
.
I was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you visited Me with help and ministering care, I was in prison and you came to see Me. -- matthew 25:36
.
Then the just and upright will answer Him, Lord, when did we see You hungry and gave You food, or thirsty and gave You something to drink? -- matthew 25:37
.
And when did we see You a stranger and welcomed and entertained You, or naked and clothed You? -- matthew 25:38
.
And when did we see You sick or in prison and came to visit You? -- matthew 25:39
.
And the King will reply to them, Truly I tell you, in so far as you did it for one of the least [in the estimation of men] of these My brethren, you did it for Me. -- matthew 25:40
.
Then He will say to those at His left hand, Begone from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels! -- matthew 25:41
.
For I was hungry and you gave Me no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, -- matthew 25:42
.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome Me and entertain Me, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me with help and ministering care. -- matthew 25:43
.
Then they also [in their turn] will answer, Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You? -- matthew 25:44
.
And He will reply to them, Solemnly I declare to you, in so far as you failed to do it for the least [in the estimation of men] of these, you failed to do it for Me. -- matthew 25:45
.
Then they will go away into eternal punishment, but those who are just and upright and in right standing with God into eternal life. -- matthew 25:46
.
WHEN JESUS had ended this discourse, He said to His disciples, -- matthew 26:1
.
You know that the Passover is in two days--and the Son of Man will be delivered up treacherously to be crucified. -- matthew 26:2
.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the [open] court of the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, -- matthew 26:3
.
And consulted together in order to arrest Jesus by stratagem secretly and put Him to death. -- matthew 26:4
.
But they said, It must not be during the Feast, for fear that there will be a riot among the people. -- matthew 26:5
.
Now when Jesus came back to Bethany and was in the house of Simon the leper, -- matthew 26:6
.
A woman came up to Him with an alabaster flask of very precious perfume, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table. -- matthew 26:7
.
And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, For what purpose is all this waste? -- matthew 26:8
.
For this perfume might have been sold for a large sum and the money given to the poor. -- matthew 26:9
.
But Jesus, fully aware of this, said to them, Why do you bother the woman? She has done a noble (praiseworthy and beautiful) thing to Me. -- matthew 26:10
.
For you always have the poor among you, but you will not always have Me. -- matthew 26:11
.
In pouring this perfume on My body she has done something to prepare Me for My burial. -- matthew 26:12
.
Truly I tell you, wherever this good news (the Gospel) is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will be told also, in memory of her. -- matthew 26:13
.
Then one of the Twelve [apostles], who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests -- matthew 26:14
.
And said, What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you? And they weighed out for and paid to him thirty pieces of silver [about twenty-one dollars and sixty cents]. -- matthew 26:15
.
And from that moment he sought a fitting opportunity to betray Him. -- matthew 26:16
.
Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread [Passover week], the disciples came to Jesus and said to Him, Where do You wish us to prepare for You to eat the Passover supper? -- matthew 26:17
.
He said, Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, The Master says: My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples. -- matthew 26:18
.
And accordingly the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they made ready the Passover supper. -- matthew 26:19
.
When it was evening, He was reclining at table with the twelve disciples. -- matthew 26:20
.
And as they were eating, He said, Solemnly I say to you, one of you will betray Me! -- matthew 26:21
.
They were exceedingly pained and distressed and deeply hurt and sorrowful and began to say to Him one after another, Surely it cannot be I, Lord, can it? -- matthew 26:22
.
He replied, He who has [just] dipped his hand in the same dish with Me will betray Me! -- matthew 26:23
.
The Son of Man is going just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better (more profitable and wholesome) for that man if he had never been born! -- matthew 26:24
.
Judas, the betrayer, said, Surely it is not I, is it, Master? He said to him, You have stated [the fact]. -- matthew 26:25
.
Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread and, praising God, gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use, and when He had broken it, He gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body. -- matthew 26:26
.
And He took a cup, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you; -- matthew 26:27
.
For this is My blood of the new covenant, which [ratifies the agreement and] is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. -- matthew 26:28
.
I say to you, I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you new and of superior quality in My Father's kingdom. -- matthew 26:29
.
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. -- matthew 26:30
.
Then Jesus said to them, You will all be offended and stumble and fall away because of Me this night [distrusting and deserting Me], for it is written, I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. -- matthew 26:31
.
But after I am raised up [to life again], I will go ahead of you to Galilee. -- matthew 26:32
.
Peter declared to Him, Though they all are offended and stumble and fall away because of You [and distrust and desert You], I will never do so. -- matthew 26:33
.
Jesus said to him, Solemnly I declare to you, this very night, before a single rooster crows, you will deny and disown Me three times. -- matthew 26:34
.
Peter said to Him, Even if I must die with You, I will not deny or disown You! And all the disciples said the same thing. -- matthew 26:35
.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and He told His disciples, Sit down here while I go over yonder and pray. -- matthew 26:36
.
And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to show grief and distress of mind and was deeply depressed. -- matthew 26:37
.
Then He said to them, My soul is very sad and deeply grieved, so that I am almost dying of sorrow. Stay here and keep awake and keep watch with Me. -- matthew 26:38
.
And going a little farther, He threw Himself upon the ground on His face and prayed saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will [not what I desire], but as You will and desire. -- matthew 26:39
.
And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter, What! Are you so utterly unable to stay awake and keep watch with Me for one hour? -- matthew 26:40
.
All of you must keep awake (give strict attention, be cautious and active) and watch and pray, that you may not come into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. -- matthew 26:41
.
Again a second time He went away and prayed, My Father, if this cannot pass by unless I drink it, Your will be done. -- matthew 26:42
.
And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down with sleep. -- matthew 26:43
.
So, leaving them again, He went away and prayed for the third time, using the same words. -- matthew 26:44
.
Then He returned to the disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of especially wicked sinners [whose way or nature it is to act in opposition to God]. -- matthew 26:45
.
Get up, let us be going! See, My betrayer is at hand! -- matthew 26:46
.
As He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve [apostles], came up, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. -- matthew 26:47
.
Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, The One I shall kiss is the Man; seize Him. -- matthew 26:48
.
And he came up to Jesus at once and said, Hail (greetings, good health to You, long life to You), Master! And he embraced Him and kissed Him with [pretended] warmth and devotion. -- matthew 26:49
.
Jesus said to him, Friend, for what are you here? Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him. -- matthew 26:50
.
And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and, striking the body servant of the high priest, cut off his ear. -- matthew 26:51
.
Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. -- matthew 26:52
.
Do you suppose that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will immediately provide Me with more than twelve legions [more than 80,000] of angels? -- matthew 26:53
.
But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must come about this way? -- matthew 26:54
.
At that moment Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber to capture Me? Day after day I was accustomed to sit in the porches and courts of the temple teaching, and you did not arrest Me. -- matthew 26:55
.
But all this has taken place in order that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples deserted Him and, fleeing, escaped. -- matthew 26:56
.
But those who had seized Jesus took Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled. -- matthew 26:57
.
But Peter followed Him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest's home; he even went inside and sat with the guards to see the end. -- matthew 26:58
.
Now the chief priests and the whole council (the Sanhedrin) sought to get false witnesses to testify against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death; -- matthew 26:59
.
But they found none, though many witnesses came forward [to testify]. At last two men came forward -- matthew 26:60
.
And testified, This Fellow said, I am able to tear down the sanctuary of the temple of God and to build it up again in three days. -- matthew 26:61
.
And the high priest stood up and said, Have You no answer to make? What about this that these men testify against You? -- matthew 26:62
.
But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, I call upon you to swear by the living God, and tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God. -- matthew 26:63
.
Jesus said to him, You have stated [the fact]. More than that, I tell you: You will in the future see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of the sky. -- matthew 26:64
.
Then the high priest tore his clothes and exclaimed, He has uttered blasphemy! What need have we of further evidence? You have now heard His blasphemy. -- matthew 26:65
.
What do you think now? They answered, He deserves to be put to death. -- matthew 26:66
.
Then they spat in His face and struck Him with their fists; and some slapped Him in the face, -- matthew 26:67
.
Saying, Prophesy to us, You Christ (the Messiah)! Who was it that struck You? -- matthew 26:68
.
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one maid came up to him and said, You were also with Jesus the Galilean! -- matthew 26:69
.
But he denied it falsely before them all, saying, I do not know what you mean. -- matthew 26:70
.
And when he had gone out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, This fellow was with Jesus the Nazarene! -- matthew 26:71
.
And again he denied it and disowned Him with an oath, saying, I do not know the Man! -- matthew 26:72
.
After a little while, the bystanders came up and said to Peter, You certainly are one of them too, for even your accent betrays you. -- matthew 26:73
.
Then Peter began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, I do not even know the Man! And at that moment a rooster crowed. -- matthew 26:74
.
And Peter remembered Jesus' words, when He had said, Before a single rooster crows, you will deny and disown Me three times. And he went outside and wept bitterly. -- matthew 26:75
.
WHEN IT was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people held a consultation against Jesus to put Him to death; -- matthew 27:1
.
And they bound Him and led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the governor. -- matthew 27:2
.
When Judas, His betrayer, saw that [Jesus] was condemned, [Judas was afflicted in mind and troubled for his former folly; and] with remorse [with little more than a selfish dread of the consequences] he brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, -- matthew 27:3
.
Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. They replied, What is that to us? See to that yourself. -- matthew 27:4
.
And casting the pieces of silver [forward] into the [Holy Place of the sanctuary of the] temple, he departed; and he went off and hanged himself. -- matthew 27:5
.
But the chief priests, picking up the pieces of silver, said, It is not legal to put these in the [consecrated] treasury, for it is the price of blood. -- matthew 27:6
.
So after consultation they bought with them [the pieces of silver] the potter's field [as a place] in which to bury strangers. -- matthew 27:7
.
Therefore that piece of ground has been called the Field of Blood to the present day. -- matthew 27:8
.
Then were fulfilled the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet when he said, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him on Whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, -- matthew 27:9
.
And they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me. -- matthew 27:10
.
Now Jesus stood before the governor [Pilate], and the governor asked Him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus said to him, You have stated [the fact]. -- matthew 27:11
.
But when the charges were made against Him by the chief priests and elders, He made no answer. -- matthew 27:12
.
Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many and how serious are the things they are testifying against You? -- matthew 27:13
.
But He made no reply to him, not even to a single accusation, so that the governor marveled greatly. -- matthew 27:14
.
Now at the Feast [of the Passover] the governor was in the habit of setting free for the people any one prisoner whom they chose. -- matthew 27:15
.
And at that time they had a notorious prisoner whose name was Barabbas. -- matthew 27:16
.
So when they had assembled for this purpose, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to set free for you, Barabbas, or Jesus Who is called Christ? -- matthew 27:17
.
For he knew that it was because of envy that they had handed Him over to him. -- matthew 27:18
.
Also, while he was seated on the judgment bench, his wife sent him a message, saying, Have nothing to do with that just and upright Man, for I have had a painful experience today in a dream because of Him. -- matthew 27:19
.
But the chief priests and the elders prevailed on the people to ask for Barabbas, and put Jesus to death. -- matthew 27:20
.
Again the governor said to them, Which of the two do you wish me to release for you? And they said, Barabbas! -- matthew 27:21
.
Pilate said to them, Then what shall I do with Jesus Who is called Christ? -- matthew 27:22
.
They all replied, Let Him be crucified! And he said, Why? What has He done that is evil? But they shouted all the louder, Let Him be crucified! -- matthew 27:23
.
So when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but rather that a riot was about to break out, he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd, saying, I am not guilty of nor responsible for this righteous Man's blood; see to it yourselves. -- matthew 27:24
.
And all the people answered, Let His blood be on us and on our children! -- matthew 27:25
.
So he set free for them Barabbas; and he [had] Jesus whipped, and delivered Him up to be crucified. -- matthew 27:26
.
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, and they gathered the whole battalion about Him. -- matthew 27:27
.
And they stripped off His clothes and put a scarlet robe (garment of dignity and office worn by Roman officers of rank) upon Him, -- matthew 27:28
.
And, weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on His head and put a reed (staff) in His right hand. And kneeling before Him, they made sport of Him, saying, Hail (greetings, good health to You, long life to You), King of the Jews! -- matthew 27:29
.
And they spat on Him, and took the reed (staff) and struck Him on the head. -- matthew 27:30
.
And when they finished making sport of Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His own garments on Him and led Him away to be crucified. -- matthew 27:31
.
As they were marching forth, they came upon a man of Cyrene named Simon; this man they forced to carry the cross of Jesus. -- matthew 27:32
.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha [Latin: Calvary], which means The Place of a Skull, -- matthew 27:33
.
They offered Him wine mingled with gall to drink; but when He tasted it, He refused to drink it. -- matthew 27:34
.
And when they had crucified Him, they divided and distributed His garments [among them] by casting lots so that the prophet's saying was fulfilled, They parted My garments among them and over My apparel they cast lots. -- matthew 27:35
.
Then they sat down there and kept watch over Him. -- matthew 27:36
.
And over His head they put the accusation against Him (the cause of His death), which read, This is Jesus, the King of the Jews. -- matthew 27:37
.
At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right hand and one on the left. -- matthew 27:38
.
And those who passed by spoke reproachfully and abusively and jeered at Him, wagging their heads, -- matthew 27:39
.
And they said, You Who would tear down the sanctuary of the temple and rebuild it in three days, rescue Yourself from death. If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross. -- matthew 27:40
.
In the same way the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, made sport of Him, saying, -- matthew 27:41
.
He rescued others from death; Himself He cannot rescue from death. He is the King of Israel? Let Him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Him. -- matthew 27:42
.
He trusts in God; let God deliver Him now if He cares for Him and will have Him, for He said, I am the Son of God. -- matthew 27:43
.
And the robbers who were crucified with Him also abused and reproached and made sport of Him in the same way. -- matthew 27:44
.
Now from the sixth hour (noon) there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour (three o'clock). -- matthew 27:45
.
And about the ninth hour (three o'clock) Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?--that is, My God, My God, why have You abandoned Me [leaving Me helpless, forsaking and failing Me in My need]? -- matthew 27:46
.
And some of the bystanders, when they heard it, said, This Man is calling for Elijah! -- matthew 27:47
.
And one of them immediately ran and took a sponge, soaked it with vinegar (a sour wine), and put it on a reed (staff), and was about to give it to Him to drink. -- matthew 27:48
.
But the others said, Wait! Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him from death. -- matthew 27:49
.
And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit. -- matthew 27:50
.
And at once the curtain of the sanctuary of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; the earth shook and the rocks were split. -- matthew 27:51
.
The tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep in death were raised [to life]; -- matthew 27:52
.
And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. -- matthew 27:53
.
When the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus observed the earthquake and all that was happening, they were terribly frightened and filled with awe, and said, Truly this was God's Son! -- matthew 27:54
.
There were also numerous women there, looking on from a distance, who were of those who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him. -- matthew 27:55
.
Among them were Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. -- matthew 27:56
.
When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. -- matthew 27:57
.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. -- matthew 27:58
.
And Joseph took the body and rolled it up in a clean linen cloth used for swathing dead bodies -- matthew 27:59
.
And laid it in his own fresh (undefiled) tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and he rolled a big boulder over the door of the tomb and went away. -- matthew 27:60
.
And Mary of Magdala and the other Mary kept sitting there opposite the tomb. -- matthew 27:61
.
The next day, that is, the day after the day of Preparation [for the Sabbath], the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate -- matthew 27:62
.
And said, Sir, we have just remembered how that vagabond Imposter said while He was still alive, After three days I will rise again. -- matthew 27:63
.
Therefore give an order to have the tomb made secure and safeguarded until the third day, for fear that His disciples will come and steal Him away and tell the people that He has risen from the dead, and the last deception and fraud will be worse than the first. -- matthew 27:64
.
Pilate said to them, You have a guard [of soldiers; take them and] go, make it as secure as you can. -- matthew 27:65
.
So they went off and made the tomb secure by sealing the boulder, a guard of soldiers being with them and remaining to watch. -- matthew 27:66
.
NOW AFTER the Sabbath, near dawn of the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb. -- matthew 28:1
.
And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled the boulder back and sat upon it. -- matthew 28:2
.
His appearance was like lightning, and his garments as white as snow. -- matthew 28:3
.
And those keeping guard were so frightened at the sight of him that they were agitated and they trembled and became like dead men. -- matthew 28:4
.
But the angel said to the women, Do not be alarmed and frightened, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, Who was crucified. -- matthew 28:5
.
He is not here; He has risen, as He said [He would do]. Come, see the place where He lay. -- matthew 28:6
.
Then go quickly and tell His disciples, He has risen from the dead, and behold, He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you. -- matthew 28:7
.
So they left the tomb hastily with fear and great joy and ran to tell the disciples. -- matthew 28:8
.
And as they went, behold, Jesus met them and said, Hail (greetings)! And they went up to Him and clasped His feet and worshiped Him. -- matthew 28:9
.
Then Jesus said to them, Do not be alarmed and afraid; go and tell My brethren to go into Galilee, and there they will see Me. -- matthew 28:10
.
While they were on their way, behold, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had occurred. -- matthew 28:11
.
And when they [the chief priests] had gathered with the elders and had consulted together, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers, -- matthew 28:12
.
And said, Tell people, His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping. -- matthew 28:13
.
And if the governor hears of it, we will appease him and make you safe and free from trouble and care. -- matthew 28:14
.
So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been current among the Jews to the present day. -- matthew 28:15
.
Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed and made appointment with them. -- matthew 28:16
.
And when they saw Him, they fell down and worshiped Him; but some doubted. -- matthew 28:17
.
Jesus approached and, breaking the silence, said to them, All authority (all power of rule) in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. -- matthew 28:18
.
Go then and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, -- matthew 28:19
.
Teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days (perpetually, uniformly, and on every occasion), to the [very] close and consummation of the age. Amen (so let it be). -- matthew 28:20
.
THE BEGINNING [of the facts] of the good news (the Gospel) of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. -- mark 1:1
.
Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will make ready Your way-- -- mark 1:2
.
A voice of one crying in the wilderness [shouting in the desert], Prepare the way of the Lord, make His beaten tracks straight (level and passable)! -- mark 1:3
.
John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness (desert), preaching a baptism [obligating] repentance (a change of one's mind for the better, heartily amending one's ways, with abhorrence of his past sins) in order to obtain forgiveness of and release from sins. -- mark 1:4
.
And there kept going out to him [continuously] all the country of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, as they were confessing their sins. -- mark 1:5
.
And John wore clothing woven of camel's hair and had a leather girdle around his loins and ate locusts and wild honey. -- mark 1:6
.
And he preached, saying, After me comes He Who is stronger (more powerful and more valiant) than I, the strap of Whose sandals I am not worthy or fit to stoop down and unloose. -- mark 1:7
.
I have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. -- mark 1:8
.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. -- mark 1:9
.
And when He came up out of the water, at once he [John] saw the heavens torn open and the [Holy] Spirit like a dove coming down [to enter] into Him. -- mark 1:10
.
And there came a voice out from within heaven, You are My Beloved Son; in You I am well pleased. -- mark 1:11
.
Immediately the [Holy] Spirit [from within] drove Him out into the wilderness (desert), -- mark 1:12
.
And He stayed in the wilderness (desert) forty days, being tempted [all the while] by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to Him [continually]. -- mark 1:13
.
Now after John was arrested and put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God, -- mark 1:14
.
And saying, The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled (completed), and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent (have a change of mind which issues in regret for past sins and in change of conduct for the better) and believe (trust in, rely on, and adhere to) the good news (the Gospel). -- mark 1:15
.
And passing along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon [Peter] and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net [to and fro] in the sea, for they were fishermen. -- mark 1:16
.
And Jesus said to them, Come after Me and be My disciples, and I will make you to become fishers of men. -- mark 1:17
.
And at once they left their nets and [yielding up all claim to them] followed [with] Him [joining Him as disciples and siding with His party]. -- mark 1:18
.
He went on a little farther and saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in [their] boat putting their nets in order. -- mark 1:19
.
And immediately He called out to them, and [abandoning all mutual claims] they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went off after Him [to be His disciples, side with His party, and follow Him]. -- mark 1:20
.
And they entered into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He went into the synagogue and began to teach. -- mark 1:21
.
And they were completely astonished at His teaching, for He was teaching as One Who possessed authority, and not as the scribes. -- mark 1:22
.
Just at that time there was in their synagogue a man [who was in the power] of an unclean spirit; and now [immediately] he raised a deep and terrible cry from the depths of his throat, saying, -- mark 1:23
.
What have You to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God! -- mark 1:24
.
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hush up (be muzzled, gagged), and come out of him! -- mark 1:25
.
And the unclean spirit, throwing the man into convulsions and screeching with a loud voice, came out of him. -- mark 1:26
.
And they were all so amazed and almost terrified that they kept questioning and demanding one of another, saying, What is this? What new (fresh) teaching! With authority He gives orders even to the unclean spirits and they obey Him! -- mark 1:27
.
And immediately rumors concerning Him spread [everywhere] throughout all the region surrounding Galilee. -- mark 1:28
.
And at once He left the synagogue and went into the house of Simon [Peter] and Andrew, accompanied by James and John. -- mark 1:29
.
Now Simon's mother-in-law had for some time been lying sick with a fever, and at once they told Him about her. -- mark 1:30
.
And He went up to her and took her by the hand and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she began to wait on them. -- mark 1:31
.
Now when it was evening, after the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those under the power of demons, -- mark 1:32
.
Until the whole town was gathered together about the door. -- mark 1:33
.
And He cured many who were afflicted with various diseases; and He drove out many demons, but would not allow the demons to talk because they knew Him [intuitively]. -- mark 1:34
.
And in the morning, long before daylight, He got up and went out to a deserted place, and there He prayed. -- mark 1:35
.
And Simon [Peter] and those who were with him followed Him [pursuing Him eagerly and hunting Him out], -- mark 1:36
.
And they found Him and said to Him, Everybody is looking for You. -- mark 1:37
.
And He said to them, Let us be going on into the neighboring country towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out. -- mark 1:38
.
[So] He went throughout the whole of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. -- mark 1:39
.
And a leper came to Him, begging Him on his knees and saying to Him, If You are willing, You are able to make me clean. -- mark 1:40
.
And being moved with pity and sympathy, Jesus reached out His hand and touched him, and said to him, I am willing; be made clean! -- mark 1:41
.
And at once the leprosy [completely] left him and he was made clean [by being healed]. -- mark 1:42
.
And Jesus charged him sternly (sharply and threateningly, and with earnest admonition) and [acting with deep feeling thrust him forth and] sent him away at once, -- mark 1:43
.
And said to him, See that you tell nothing [of this] to anyone; but begone, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your purification what Moses commanded, as a proof (an evidence and witness) to the people [that you are really healed]. -- mark 1:44
.
But he went out and began to talk so freely about it and blaze abroad the news [spreading it everywhere] that [Jesus] could no longer openly go into a town but was outside in [lonely] desert places. But the people kept on coming to Him from all sides and every quarter. -- mark 1:45
.
AND JESUS having returned to Capernaum, after some days it was rumored about that He was in the house [probably Peter's]. -- mark 2:1
.
And so many people gathered together there that there was no longer room [for them], not even around the door; and He was discussing the Word. -- mark 2:2
.
Then they came, bringing a paralytic to Him, who had been picked up and was being carried by four men. -- mark 2:3
.
And when they could not get him to a place in front of Jesus because of the throng, they dug through the roof above Him; and when they had scooped out an opening, they let down the [thickly padded] quilt or mat upon which the paralyzed man lay. -- mark 2:4
.
And when Jesus saw their faith [their confidence in God through Him], He said to the paralyzed man, Son, your sins are forgiven [you] and put away [that is, the penalty is remitted, the sense of guilt removed, and you are made upright and in right standing with God]. -- mark 2:5
.
Now some of the scribes were sitting there, holding a dialogue with themselves as they questioned in their hearts, -- mark 2:6
.
Why does this Man talk like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins [remove guilt, remit the penalty, and bestow righteousness instead] except God alone? -- mark 2:7
.
And at once Jesus, becoming fully aware in His spirit that they thus debated within themselves, said to them, Why do you argue (debate, reason) about all this in your hearts? -- mark 2:8
.
Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, Your sins are forgiven and put away, or to say, Rise, take up your sleeping pad or mat, and start walking about [and keep on walking]? -- mark 2:9
.
But that you may know positively and beyond a doubt that the Son of Man has right and authority and power on earth to forgive sins--He said to the paralyzed man, -- mark 2:10
.
I say to you, arise, pick up and carry your sleeping pad or mat, and be going on home. -- mark 2:11
.
And he arose at once and picked up the sleeping pad or mat and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and recognized and praised and thanked God, saying, We have never seen anything like this before! -- mark 2:12
.
[Jesus] went out again along the seashore; and all the multitude kept gathering about Him, and He kept teaching them. -- mark 2:13
.
And as He was passing by, He saw Levi (Matthew) son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, Follow Me! [Be joined to Me as a disciple, side with My party!] And he arose and joined Him as His disciple and sided with His party and accompanied Him. -- mark 2:14
.
And as Jesus, together with His disciples, sat at table in his [Levi's] house, many tax collectors and persons [definitely stained] with sin were dining with Him, for there were many who walked the same road (followed) with Him. -- mark 2:15
.
And the scribes [belonging to the party] of the Pharisees, when they saw that He was eating with [those definitely known to be especially wicked] sinners and tax collectors, said to His disciples, Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and [notorious] sinners? -- mark 2:16
.
And when Jesus heard it, He said to them, Those who are strong and well have no need of a physician, but those who are weak and sick; I came not to call the righteous ones to repentance, but sinners (the erring ones and all those not free from sin). -- mark 2:17
.
Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were observing a fast; and [some people] came and asked Jesus, Why are John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting, but Your disciples are not doing so? -- mark 2:18
.
Jesus answered them, Can the wedding guests fast (abstain from food and drink) while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. -- mark 2:19
.
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and they will fast in that day. -- mark 2:20
.
No one sews a patch of unshrunken (new) goods on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and the rent (tear) becomes bigger and worse [than it was before]. -- mark 2:21
.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the bottles destroyed; but new wine is to be put in new (fresh) wineskins. -- mark 2:22
.
One Sabbath He was going along beside the fields of standing grain, and as they made their way, His disciples began to pick off the grains. -- mark 2:23
.
And the Pharisees said to Him, Look! Why are they doing what is not permitted or lawful on the Sabbath? -- mark 2:24
.
And He said to them, Have you never [even] read what David did when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were accompanying him?-- -- mark 2:25
.
How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was the high priest, and ate the sacred loaves set forth [before God], which it is not permitted or lawful for any but the priests to eat, and [how he] also gave [them] to those who were with him? [I Sam. 21:1-6; II Sam. 8:17.] -- mark 2:26
.
And Jesus said to them, The Sabbath was made on account and for the sake of man, not man for the Sabbath; -- mark 2:27
.
So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath. -- mark 2:28
.
AGAIN JESUS went into a synagogue, and a man was there who had one withered hand [as the result of accident or disease]. -- mark 3:1
.
And [the Pharisees] kept watching Jesus [closely] to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath, so that they might get a charge to bring against Him [formally]. -- mark 3:2
.
And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Get up [and stand here] in the midst. -- mark 3:3
.
And He said to them, Is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to take it? But they kept silence. -- mark 3:4
.
And He glanced around at them with vexation and anger, grieved at the hardening of their hearts, and said to the man, Hold out your hand. He held it out, and his hand was [completely] restored. -- mark 3:5
.
Then the Pharisees went out and immediately held a consultation with the Herodians against Him, how they might [devise some means to] put Him to death. -- mark 3:6
.
And Jesus retired with His disciples to the lake, and a great throng from Galilee followed Him. Also from Judea -- mark 3:7
.
And from Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon--a vast multitude, hearing all the many things that He was doing, came to Him. -- mark 3:8
.
And He told His disciples to have a little boat in [constant] readiness for Him because of the crowd, lest they press hard upon Him and crush Him. -- mark 3:9
.
For He had healed so many that all who had distressing bodily diseases kept falling upon Him and pressing upon Him in order that they might touch Him. -- mark 3:10
.
And the spirits, the unclean ones, as often as they might see Him, fell down before Him and kept screaming out, You are the Son of God! -- mark 3:11
.
And He charged them strictly and severely under penalty again and again that they should not make Him known. -- mark 3:12
.
And He went up on the hillside and called to Him [for Himself] those whom He wanted and chose, and they came to Him. -- mark 3:13
.
And He appointed twelve to continue to be with Him, and that He might send them out to preach [as apostles or special messengers] -- mark 3:14
.
And to have authority and power to heal the sick and to drive out demons: -- mark 3:15
.
[They were] Simon, and He surnamed [him] Peter; -- mark 3:16
.
James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, and He surnamed them Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder; -- mark 3:17
.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew (Nathaniel), and Matthew, and Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus (Judas, not Iscariot), and Simon the Cananaean [also called Zelotes], -- mark 3:18
.
And Judas Iscariot, he who betrayed Him. -- mark 3:19
.
Then He went to a house [probably Peter's], but a throng came together again, so that Jesus and His disciples could not even take food. -- mark 3:20
.
And when those who belonged to Him (His kinsmen) heard it, they went out to take Him by force, for they kept saying, He is out of His mind (beside Himself, deranged)! -- mark 3:21
.
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He is possessed by Beelzebub, and, By [the help of] the prince of demons He is casting out demons. -- mark 3:22
.
And He summoned them to Him and said to them in parables (illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them), How can Satan drive out Satan? -- mark 3:23
.
And if a kingdom is divided and rebelling against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. -- mark 3:24
.
And if a house is divided (split into factions and rebelling) against itself, that house will not be able to last. -- mark 3:25
.
And if Satan has raised an insurrection against himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is [surely] coming to an end. -- mark 3:26
.
But no one can go into a strong man's house and ransack his household goods right and left and seize them as plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may [thoroughly] plunder his house. -- mark 3:27
.
Truly and solemnly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever abusive and blasphemous things they utter; -- mark 3:28
.
But whoever speaks abusively against or maliciously misrepresents the Holy Spirit can never get forgiveness, but is guilty of and is in the grasp of an everlasting trespass. -- mark 3:29
.
For they persisted in saying, He has an unclean spirit. -- mark 3:30
.
Then His mother and His brothers came and, standing outside, they sent word to Him, calling [for] Him. -- mark 3:31
.
And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are outside asking for You. -- mark 3:32
.
And He replied, Who are My mother and My brothers? -- mark 3:33
.
And looking around on those who sat in a circle about Him, He said, See! Here are My mother and My brothers; -- mark 3:34
.
For whoever does the things God wills is My brother and sister and mother! -- mark 3:35
.
AGAIN JESUS began to teach beside the lake. And a very great crowd gathered about Him, so that He got into a ship in order to sit in it on the sea, and the whole crowd was at the lakeside on the shore. -- mark 4:1
.
And He taught them many things in parables (illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them), and in His teaching He said to them: -- mark 4:2
.
Give attention to this! Behold, a sower went out to sow. -- mark 4:3
.
And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. -- mark 4:4
.
Other seed [of the same kind] fell on ground full of rocks, where it had not much soil; and at once it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil; -- mark 4:5
.
And when the sun came up, it was scorched, and because it had not taken root, it withered away. -- mark 4:6
.
Other seed [of the same kind] fell among thorn plants, and the thistles grew and pressed together and utterly choked and suffocated it, and it yielded no grain. -- mark 4:7
.
And other seed [of the same kind] fell into good (well-adapted) soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing, and yielded up to thirty times as much, and sixty times as much, and even a hundred times as much as had been sown. -- mark 4:8
.
And He said, He who has ears to hear, let him be hearing [and let him consider, and comprehend]. -- mark 4:9
.
And as soon as He was alone, those who were around Him, with the Twelve [apostles], began to ask Him about the parables. -- mark 4:10
.
And He said to them, To you has been entrusted the mystery of the kingdom of God [that is, the secret counsels of God which are hidden from the ungodly]; but for those outside [of our circle] everything becomes a parable, -- mark 4:11
.
In order that they may [indeed] look and look but not see and perceive, and may hear and hear but not grasp and comprehend, lest haply they should turn again, and it [their willful rejection of the truth] should be forgiven them. -- mark 4:12
.
And He said to them, Do you not discern and understand this parable? How then is it possible for you to discern and understand all the parables? -- mark 4:13
.
The sower sows the Word. -- mark 4:14
.
The ones along the path are those who have the Word sown [in their hearts], but when they hear, Satan comes at once and [by force] takes away the message which is sown in them. -- mark 4:15
.
And in the same way the ones sown upon stony ground are those who, when they hear the Word, at once receive and accept and welcome it with joy; -- mark 4:16
.
And they have no real root in themselves, and so they endure for a little while; then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the Word, they immediately are offended (become displeased, indignant, resentful) and they stumble and fall away. -- mark 4:17
.
And the ones sown among the thorns are others who hear the Word; -- mark 4:18
.
Then the cares and anxieties of the world and distractions of the age, and the pleasure and delight and false glamour and deceitfulness of riches, and the craving and passionate desire for other things creep in and choke and suffocate the Word, and it becomes fruitless. -- mark 4:19
.
And those sown on the good (well-adapted) soil are the ones who hear the Word and receive and accept and welcome it and bear fruit--some thirty times as much as was sown, some sixty times as much, and some [even] a hundred times as much. -- mark 4:20
.
And He said to them, Is the lamp brought in to be put under a peck measure or under a bed, and not [to be put] on the lampstand? -- mark 4:21
.
[Things are hidden temporarily only as a means to revelation.] For there is nothing hidden except to be revealed, nor is anything [temporarily] kept secret except in order that it may be made known. -- mark 4:22
.
If any man has ears to hear, let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend. -- mark 4:23
.
And He said to them, Be careful what you are hearing. The measure [of thought and study] you give [to the truth you hear] will be the measure [of virtue and knowledge] that comes back to you--and more [besides] will be given to you who hear. -- mark 4:24
.
For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away [by force], -- mark 4:25
.
And He said, The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed upon the ground, -- mark 4:26
.
And then continues sleeping and rising night and day while the seed sprouts and grows and increases--he knows not how. -- mark 4:27
.
The earth produces [acting] by itself--first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. -- mark 4:28
.
But when the grain is ripe and permits, immediately he sends forth [the reapers] and puts in the sickle, because the harvest stands ready. -- mark 4:29
.
And He said, With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use to illustrate and explain it? -- mark 4:30
.
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all seeds upon the earth; -- mark 4:31
.
Yet after it is sown, it grows up and becomes the greatest of all garden herbs and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air are able to make nests and dwell in its shade. -- mark 4:32
.
With many such parables [Jesus] spoke the Word to them, as they were able to hear and to comprehend and understand. -- mark 4:33
.
He did not tell them anything without a parable; but privately to His disciples (those who were peculiarly His own) He explained everything [fully]. -- mark 4:34
.
On that same day [when] evening had come, He said to them, Let us go over to the other side [of the lake]. -- mark 4:35
.
And leaving the throng, they took Him with them, [just] as He was, in the boat [in which He was sitting]. And other boats were with Him. -- mark 4:36
.
And a furious storm of wind [of hurricane proportions] arose, and the waves kept beating into the boat, so that it was already becoming filled. -- mark 4:37
.
But He [Himself] was in the stern [of the boat], asleep on the [leather] cushion; and they awoke Him and said to Him, Master, do You not care that we are perishing? -- mark 4:38
.
And He arose and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Hush now! Be still (muzzled)! And the wind ceased (sank to rest as if exhausted by its beating) and there was [immediately] a great calm (a perfect peacefulness). -- mark 4:39
.
He said to them, Why are you so timid and fearful? How is it that you have no faith (no firmly relying trust)? -- mark 4:40
.
And they were filled with great awe and feared exceedingly and said one to another, Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey Him? -- mark 4:41
.
THEY CAME to the other side of the sea to the region of the Gerasenes. -- mark 5:1
.
And as soon as He got out of the boat, there met Him out of the tombs a man [under the power] of an unclean spirit. -- mark 5:2
.
This man continually lived among the tombs, and no one could subdue him any more, even with a chain; -- mark 5:3
.
For he had been bound often with shackles for the feet and handcuffs, but the handcuffs of [light] chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he rubbed and ground together and broke in pieces; and no one had strength enough to restrain or tame him. -- mark 5:4
.
Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always shrieking and screaming and beating and bruising and cutting himself with stones. -- mark 5:5
.
And when from a distance he saw Jesus, he ran and fell on his knees before Him in homage, -- mark 5:6
.
And crying out with a loud voice, he said, What have You to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? [What is there in common between us?] I solemnly implore you by God, do not begin to torment me! -- mark 5:7
.
For Jesus was commanding, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit! -- mark 5:8
.
And He asked him, What is your name? He replied, My name is Legion, for we are many. -- mark 5:9
.
And he kept begging Him urgently not to send them [himself and the other demons] away out of that region. -- mark 5:10
.
Now a great herd of hogs was grazing there on the hillside. -- mark 5:11
.
And the demons begged Him, saying, Send us to the hogs, that we may go into them! -- mark 5:12
.
So He gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out [of the man] and entered into the hogs; and the herd, numbering about 2,000, rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea. -- mark 5:13
.
The hog feeders ran away, and told [it] in the town and in the country. And [the people] came to see what it was that had taken place. -- mark 5:14
.
And they came to Jesus and looked intently and searchingly at the man who had been a demoniac, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, [the same man] who had had the legion [of demons]; and they were seized with alarm and struck with fear. -- mark 5:15
.
And those who had seen it related in full what had happened to the man possessed by demons and to the hogs. -- mark 5:16
.
And they began to beg [Jesus] to leave their neighborhood. -- mark 5:17
.
And when He had stepped into the boat, the man who had been controlled by the unclean spirits kept begging Him that he might be with Him. -- mark 5:18
.
But Jesus refused to permit him, but said to him, Go home to your own [family and relatives and friends] and bring back word to them of how much the Lord has done for you, and [how He has] had sympathy for you and mercy on you. -- mark 5:19
.
And he departed and began to publicly proclaim in Decapolis [the region of the ten cities] how much Jesus had done for him, and all the people were astonished and marveled. -- mark 5:20
.
And when Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side, a great throng gathered about Him, and He was at the lakeshore. -- mark 5:21
.
Then one of the rulers of the synagogue came up, Jairus by name; and seeing Him, he prostrated himself at His feet -- mark 5:22
.
And begged Him earnestly, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, so that she may be healed and live. -- mark 5:23
.
And Jesus went with him; and a great crowd kept following Him and pressed Him from all sides [so as almost to suffocate Him]. -- mark 5:24
.
And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, -- mark 5:25
.
And who had endured much suffering under [the hands of] many physicians and had spent all that she had, and was no better but instead grew worse. -- mark 5:26
.
She had heard the reports concerning Jesus, and she came up behind Him in the throng and touched His garment, -- mark 5:27
.
For she kept saying, If I only touch His garments, I shall be restored to health. -- mark 5:28
.
And immediately her flow of blood was dried up at the source, and [suddenly] she felt in her body that she was healed of her [distressing] ailment. -- mark 5:29
.
And Jesus, recognizing in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around immediately in the crowd and said, Who touched My clothes? -- mark 5:30
.
And the disciples kept saying to Him, You see the crowd pressing hard around You from all sides, and You ask, Who touched Me? -- mark 5:31
.
Still He kept looking around to see her who had done it. -- mark 5:32
.
But the woman, knowing what had been done for her, though alarmed and frightened and trembling, fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. -- mark 5:33
.
And He said to her, Daughter, your faith (your trust and confidence in Me, springing from faith in God) has restored you to health. Go in (into) peace and be continually healed and freed from your [distressing bodily] disease. -- mark 5:34
.
While He was still speaking, there came some from the ruler's house, who said [to Jairus], Your daughter has died. Why bother and distress the Teacher any further? -- mark 5:35
.
Overhearing but ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear; only keep on believing. -- mark 5:36
.
And He permitted no one to accompany Him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. -- mark 5:37
.
When they arrived at the house of the ruler of the synagogue, He looked [carefully and with understanding] at [the] tumult and the people weeping and wailing loudly. -- mark 5:38
.
And when He had gone in, He said to them, Why do you make an uproar and weep? The little girl is not dead but is sleeping. -- mark 5:39
.
And they laughed and jeered at Him. But He put them all out, and, taking the child's father and mother and those who were with Him, He went in where the little girl was lying. -- mark 5:40
.
Gripping her [firmly] by the hand, He said to her, Talitha cumi--which translated is, Little girl, I say to you, arise [from the sleep of death]! -- mark 5:41
.
And instantly the girl got up and started walking around--for she was twelve years old. And they were utterly astonished and overcome with amazement. -- mark 5:42
.
And He strictly commanded and warned them that no one should know this, and He [expressly] told them to give her [something] to eat. -- mark 5:43
.
JESUS WENT away from there and came to His [own] country and hometown [Nazareth], and His disciples followed [with] Him. -- mark 6:1
.
And on the Sabbath He began to teach in the synagogue; and many who listened to Him were utterly astonished, saying, Where did this Man acquire all this? What is the wisdom [the broad and full intelligence which has been] given to Him? What mighty works and exhibitions of power are wrought by His hands! -- mark 6:2
.
Is not this the Carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here among us? And they took offense at Him and were hurt [that is, they disapproved of Him, and it hindered them from acknowledging His authority] and they were caused to stumble and fall. -- mark 6:3
.
But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor (deference, reverence) except in his [own] country and among [his] relatives and in his [own] house. -- mark 6:4
.
And He was not able to do even one work of power there, except that He laid His hands on a few sickly people [and] cured them. -- mark 6:5
.
And He marveled because of their unbelief (their lack of faith in Him). And He went about among the surrounding villages and continued teaching. -- mark 6:6
.
And He called to Him the Twelve [apostles] and began to send them out [as His ambassadors] two by two and gave them authority and power over the unclean spirits. -- mark 6:7
.
He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick--no bread, no wallet for a collection bag, no money in their belts (girdles, purses)-- -- mark 6:8
.
But to go with sandals on their feet and not to put on two tunics (undergarments). -- mark 6:9
.
And He told them, Wherever you go into a house, stay there until you leave that place. -- mark 6:10
.
And if any community will not receive and accept and welcome you, and they refuse to listen to you, when you depart, shake off the dust that is on your feet, for a testimony against them. Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment day than for that town. -- mark 6:11
.
So they went out and preached that men should repent [that they should change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways, with abhorrence of their past sins]. -- mark 6:12
.
And they drove out many unclean spirits and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them. -- mark 6:13
.
King Herod heard of it, for [Jesus'] name had become well known. He and they [of his court] said, John the Baptist has been raised from the dead; that is why these mighty powers [of performing miracles] are at work in Him. -- mark 6:14
.
[But] others kept saying, It is Elijah! And others said, It is a prophet, like one of the prophets [of old]. -- mark 6:15
.
But when Herod heard [of it], he said, [This very] John, whom I beheaded, has been raised [from the dead]. -- mark 6:16
.
For [this] Herod himself had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he [Herod] had married her. -- mark 6:17
.
For John had told Herod, It is not lawful and you have no right to have your brother's wife. -- mark 6:18
.
And Herodias was angry (enraged) with him and held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him; but she could not, -- mark 6:19
.
For Herod had [a reverential] fear of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and [continually] kept him safe [under guard]. When he heard , he was much perplexed; and [yet] he heard him gladly. -- mark 6:20
.
But an opportune time came [for Herodias] when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and the high military commanders and chief men of Galilee. -- mark 6:21
.
For when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased and fascinated Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, Ask me for whatever you desire, and I will give it to you. -- mark 6:22
.
And he put himself under oath to her, Whatever you ask me, I will give it to you, even to the half of my kingdom. -- mark 6:23
.
Then she left the room and said to her mother, What shall I ask for [myself]? And she replied, The head of John the Baptist! -- mark 6:24
.
And she rushed back instantly to the king and requested, saying, I wish you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter. -- mark 6:25
.
And the king was deeply pained and grieved and exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to slight her [by breaking faith with her]. -- mark 6:26
.
And immediately the king sent off one [of the soldiers] of his bodyguard and gave him orders to bring [John's] head. He went and beheaded him in the prison -- mark 6:27
.
And brought his head on a platter and handed it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. -- mark 6:28
.
When his disciples learned of it, they came and took [John's] body and laid it in a tomb. -- mark 6:29
.
The apostles [sent out as missionaries] came back and gathered together to Jesus, and told Him all that they had done and taught. -- mark 6:30
.
And He said to them, [As for you] come away by yourselves to a deserted place, and rest a while--for many were [continually] coming and going, and they had not even leisure enough to eat. -- mark 6:31
.
And they went away in a boat to a solitary place by themselves. -- mark 6:32
.
Now many [people] saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the surrounding towns, and they got there ahead [of those in the boat]. -- mark 6:33
.
As Jesus landed, He saw a great crowd waiting, and He was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things. -- mark 6:34
.
And when the day was already far gone, His disciples came to Him and said, This is a desolate and isolated place, and the hour is now late. -- mark 6:35
.
Send the crowds away to go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat. -- mark 6:36
.
But He replied to them, Give them something to eat yourselves. And they said to Him, Shall we go and buy denarii [about forty dollars] worth of bread and give it to them to eat? [II Kings 4:42-44.] -- mark 6:37
.
And He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they [had looked and] knew, they said, Five [loaves] and two fish. -- mark 6:38
.
Then He commanded the people all to recline on the green grass by companies. -- mark 6:39
.
So they threw themselves down in ranks of hundreds and fifties [with the regularity of an arrangement of beds of herbs, looking like so many garden plots]. -- mark 6:40
.
And taking the five loaves and two fish, He looked up to heaven and, praising God, gave thanks and broke the loaves and kept on giving them to the disciples to set before the people; and He [also] divided the two fish among [them] all. -- mark 6:41
.
And they all ate and were satisfied. -- mark 6:42
.
And they took up twelve [small hand] baskets full of broken pieces [from the loaves] and of the fish. -- mark 6:43
.
And those who ate the loaves were 5,men. -- mark 6:44
.
And at once He insisted that the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida, while He was sending the throng away. -- mark 6:45
.
And after He had taken leave of them, He went off into the hills to pray. -- mark 6:46
.
Now when evening had come, the boat was out in the middle of the lake, and He was by Himself on the land. -- mark 6:47
.
And having seen that they were troubled and tormented in [their] rowing, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night [between 3:00-6:a.m.] He came to them, walking [directly] on the sea. And He acted as if He meant to pass by them, -- mark 6:48
.
But when they saw Him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and raised a [deep, throaty] shriek of terror. -- mark 6:49
.
For they all saw Him and were agitated (troubled and filled with fear and dread). But immediately He talked with them and said, Take heart! I AM! Stop being alarmed and afraid. -- mark 6:50
.
And He went up into the boat with them, and the wind ceased (sank to rest as if exhausted by its own beating). And they were astonished exceedingly [beyond measure], -- mark 6:51
.
For they failed to consider or understand [the teaching and meaning of the miracle of] the loaves; [in fact] their hearts had grown callous [had become dull and had lost the power of understanding]. -- mark 6:52
.
And when they had crossed over, they reached the land of Gennesaret and came to [anchor at] the shore. -- mark 6:53
.
As soon as they got out of the boat, [the people] recognized Him, -- mark 6:54
.
And they ran about the whole countryside, and began to carry around sick people on their sleeping pads or mats to any place where they heard that He was. -- mark 6:55
.
And wherever He came into villages or cities or the country, they would lay the sick in the marketplaces and beg Him that they might touch even the fringe of His outer garment, and as many as touched Him were restored to health. -- mark 6:56
.
NOW THERE gathered together to [Jesus] the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, -- mark 7:1
.
For they had seen that some of His disciples ate with common hands, that is, unwashed [with hands defiled and unhallowed, because they had not given them a ceremonial washing]-- -- mark 7:2
.
For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat unless [merely for ceremonial reasons] they wash their hands [diligently up to the elbow] with clenched fist, adhering [carefully and faithfully] to the tradition of [practices and customs handed down to them by] their forefathers [to be observed]. -- mark 7:3
.
And [when they come] from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they purify themselves; and there are many other traditions [oral, man-made laws handed down to them, which they observe faithfully and diligently, such as], the washing of cups and wooden pitchers and widemouthed jugs and utensils of copper and beds-- -- mark 7:4
.
And the Pharisees and scribes kept asking [Jesus], Why do Your disciples not order their way of living according to the tradition handed down by the forefathers [to be observed], but eat with hands unwashed and ceremonially not purified? -- mark 7:5
.
But He said to them, Excellently and truly [so that there will be no room for blame] did Isaiah prophesy of you, the pretenders and hypocrites, as it stands written: These people [constantly] honor Me with their lips, but their hearts hold off and are far distant from Me. -- mark 7:6
.
In vain (fruitlessly and without profit) do they worship Me, ordering and teaching [to be obeyed] as doctrines the commandments and precepts of men. -- mark 7:7
.
You disregard and give up and ask to depart from you the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men [keeping it carefully and faithfully]. -- mark 7:8
.
And He said to them, You have a fine way of rejecting [thus thwarting and nullifying and doing away with] the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition (your own human regulations)! -- mark 7:9
.
For Moses said, Honor (revere with tenderness of feeling and deference) your father and your mother, and, He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother, let him surely die. -- mark 7:10
.
But [as for you] you say, A man is exempt if he tells [his] father or [his] mother, What you would otherwise have gained from me [everything I have that would have been of use to you] is Corban, that is, is a gift [already given as an offering to God], -- mark 7:11
.
Then you no longer are permitting him to do anything for [his] father or mother [but are letting him off from helping them]. -- mark 7:12
.
Thus you are nullifying and making void and of no effect [the authority of] the Word of God through your tradition, which you [in turn] hand on. And many things of this kind you are doing. -- mark 7:13
.
And He called the people to [Him] again and said to them, Listen to Me, all of you, and understand [what I say]. -- mark 7:14
.
There is not [even] one thing outside a man which by going into him can pollute and defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him and make him unhallowed and unclean. -- mark 7:15
.
If any man has ears to hear, let him be listening [and let him perceive and comprehend by hearing]. -- mark 7:16
.
And when He had left the crowd and had gone into the house, His disciples began asking Him about the parable. -- mark 7:17
.
And He said to them, Then are you also unintelligent and dull and without understanding? Do you not discern and see that whatever goes into a man from the outside cannot make him unhallowed or unclean, -- mark 7:18
.
Since it does not reach and enter his heart but [only his] digestive tract, and so passes on [into the place designed to receive waste]? Thus He was making and declaring all foods [ceremonially] clean [that is, abolishing the ceremonial distinctions of the Levitical Law]. -- mark 7:19
.
And He said, What comes out of a man is what makes a man unclean and renders [him] unhallowed. -- mark 7:20
.
For from within, [that is] out of the hearts of men, come base and wicked thoughts, sexual immorality, stealing, murder, adultery, -- mark 7:21
.
Coveting (a greedy desire to have more wealth), dangerous and destructive wickedness, deceit; unrestrained (indecent) conduct; an evil eye (envy), slander (evil speaking, malicious misrepresentation, abusiveness), pride (the sin of an uplifted heart against God and man), foolishness (folly, lack of sense, recklessness, thoughtlessness). -- mark 7:22
.
All these evil [purposes and desires] come from within, and they make the man unclean and render him unhallowed. -- mark 7:23
.
And Jesus arose and went away from there to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And He went into a house and did not want anyone to know [that He was there]; but it was not possible for Him to be hidden [from public notice]. -- mark 7:24
.
Instead, at once, a woman whose little daughter had (was under the control of) an unclean spirit heard about Him and came and flung herself down at His feet. -- mark 7:25
.
Now the woman was a Greek (Gentile), a Syrophoenician by nationality. And she kept begging Him to drive the demon out of her little daughter. -- mark 7:26
.
And He said to her, First let the children be fed, for it is not becoming or proper or right to take the children's bread and throw it to the [little house] dogs. -- mark 7:27
.
But she answered Him, Yes, Lord, yet even the small pups under the table eat the little children's scraps of food. -- mark 7:28
.
And He said to her, Because of this saying, you may go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter [permanently]. -- mark 7:29
.
And she went home and found the child thrown on the couch, and the demon departed. -- mark 7:30
.
Soon after this, Jesus, coming back from the region of Tyre, passed through Sidon on to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of Decapolis [the ten cities]. -- mark 7:31
.
And they brought to Him a man who was deaf and had difficulty in speaking, and they begged Jesus to place His hand upon him. -- mark 7:32
.
And taking him aside from the crowd [privately], He thrust His fingers into the man's ears and spat and touched his tongue; -- mark 7:33
.
And looking up to heaven, He sighed as He said, Ephphatha, which means, Be opened! -- mark 7:34
.
And his ears were opened, his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak distinctly and as he should. -- mark 7:35
.
And Jesus [in His own interest] admonished and ordered them sternly and expressly to tell no one; but the more He commanded them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. -- mark 7:36
.
And they were overwhelmingly astonished, saying, He has done everything excellently (commendably and nobly)! He even makes the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak! -- mark 7:37
.
IN THOSE days when [again] an immense crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples to Him and told them, -- mark 8:1
.
I have pity and sympathy for the people and My heart goes out to them, for they have been with Me now three days and have nothing [left] to eat; -- mark 8:2
.
And if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will be feeble through exhaustion and faint along the road; and some of them have come a long way. -- mark 8:3
.
And His disciples replied to Him, How can anyone fill and satisfy [these people] with loaves of bread here in [this] desolate and uninhabited region? -- mark 8:4
.
And He asked them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven. -- mark 8:5
.
And He commanded the multitude to recline upon the ground, and He [then] took the seven loaves [of bread] and, having given thanks, He broke them and kept on giving them to His disciples to put before [the people], and they placed them before the crowd. -- mark 8:6
.
And they had a few small fish; and when He had praised God and given thanks and asked Him to bless them [to their use], He ordered that these also should be set before [them]. -- mark 8:7
.
And they ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven [large provision] baskets full of the broken pieces left over. -- mark 8:8
.
And there were about 4,people. And He dismissed them, -- mark 8:9
.
And at once He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha (or Magdala). -- mark 8:10
.
The Pharisees came and began to argue with and question Him, demanding from Him a sign (an attesting miracle from heaven) [maliciously] to test Him. -- mark 8:11
.
And He groaned and sighed deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation demand a sign? Positively I say to you, no sign shall be given this generation. -- mark 8:12
.
And He went away and left them and, getting into the boat again, He departed to the other side. -- mark 8:13
.
Now they had [completely] forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. -- mark 8:14
.
And Jesus [repeatedly and expressly] charged and admonished them, saying, Look out; keep on your guard and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod and the Herodians. -- mark 8:15
.
And they discussed it and reasoned with one another, It is because we have no bread. -- mark 8:16
.
And being aware [of it], Jesus said to them, Why are you reasoning and saying it is because you have no bread? Do you not yet discern or understand? Are your hearts in [a settled state of] hardness? -- mark 8:17
.
Having eyes, do you not see [with them], and having ears, do you not hear and perceive and understand the sense of what is said? And do you not remember? -- mark 8:18
.
When I broke the five loaves for the 5,000, how many [small hand] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve. -- mark 8:19
.
And [when I broke] the seven loaves for the 4,000, how many [large provision] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? And they said to Him, Seven. -- mark 8:20
.
And He kept repeating, Do you not yet understand? -- mark 8:21
.
And they came to Bethsaida. And [people] brought to Him a blind man and begged Him to touch him. -- mark 8:22
.
And He caught the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him, He asked him, Do you [possibly] see anything? -- mark 8:23
.
And he looked up and said, I see people, but [they look] like trees, walking. -- mark 8:24
.
Then He put His hands on his eyes again; and the man looked intently [that is, fixed his eyes on definite objects], and he was restored and saw everything distinctly [even what was at a distance]. -- mark 8:25
.
And He sent him away to his house, telling [him], Do not [even] enter the village or tell anyone there. -- mark 8:26
.
And Jesus went on with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples, Who do people say that I am? -- mark 8:27
.
And they answered [Him], John the Baptist; and others [say], Elijah; but others, one of the prophets. -- mark 8:28
.
And He asked them, But who do you yourselves say that I am? Peter replied to Him, You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- mark 8:29
.
And He charged them sharply to tell no one about Him. -- mark 8:30
.
And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must of necessity suffer many things and be tested and disapproved and rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days rise again [from death]. -- mark 8:31
.
And He said this freely (frankly, plainly, and explicitly, making it unmistakable). And Peter took Him by the hand and led Him aside and then [facing Him] began to rebuke Him. -- mark 8:32
.
But turning around [His back to Peter] and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind Me, Satan! For you do not have a mind intent on promoting what God wills, but what pleases men [you are not on God's side, but that of men]. -- mark 8:33
.
And Jesus called [to Him] the throng with His disciples and said to them, If anyone intends to come after Me, let him deny himself [forget, ignore, disown, and lose sight of himself and his own interests] and take up his cross, and [joining Me as a disciple and siding with My party] follow with Me [continually, cleaving steadfastly to Me]. -- mark 8:34
.
For whoever wants to save his [higher, spiritual, eternal] life, will lose it [the lower, natural, temporal life which is lived only on earth]; and whoever gives up his life [which is lived only on earth] for My sake and the Gospel's will save it [his higher, spiritual life in the eternal kingdom of God]. -- mark 8:35
.
For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life [in the eternal kingdom of God]? -- mark 8:36
.
For what can a man give as an exchange (a compensation, a ransom, in return) for his [blessed] life [in the eternal kingdom of God]? -- mark 8:37
.
For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words in this adulterous (unfaithful) and [preeminently] sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory (splendor and majesty) of His Father with the holy angels. -- mark 8:38
.
AND JESUS said to them, Truly and solemnly I say to you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death before they see the kingdom of God come in [its] power. -- mark 9:1
.
Six days after this, Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves. And He was transfigured before them and became resplendent with divine brightness. -- mark 9:2
.
And His garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller (cloth dresser, launderer) on earth could bleach them. -- mark 9:3
.
And Elijah appeared [there] to them, accompanied by Moses, and they were holding [a protracted] conversation with Jesus. -- mark 9:4
.
And Peter took up the conversation, saying, Master, it is good and suitable and beautiful for us to be here. Let us make three booths (tents)--one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah. -- mark 9:5
.
For he did not [really] know what to say, for they were in a violent fright (aghast with dread). -- mark 9:6
.
And a cloud threw a shadow upon them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the [most dearworthy] Beloved One. Be constantly listening to and obeying Him! -- mark 9:7
.
And looking around, they suddenly no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus only. -- mark 9:8
.
And as they were coming back down the mountain, He admonished and expressly ordered them to tell no one what they had seen until the Son of Man should rise from among the dead. -- mark 9:9
.
So they carefully and faithfully kept the matter to themselves, questioning and disputing with one another about what rising from among the dead meant. -- mark 9:10
.
And they asked Him, Why do the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to come first? -- mark 9:11
.
And He said to them, Elijah, it is true, does come first to restore all things and set them to rights. And how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be utterly despised and be treated with contempt and rejected? -- mark 9:12
.
But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and [people] did to him whatever they desired, as it is written of him. -- mark 9:13
.
And when they came to the [nine] disciples, they saw a great crowd around them and scribes questioning and disputing with them. -- mark 9:14
.
And immediately all the crowd, when they saw Jesus [returning from the holy mount, His face and person yet glistening], they were greatly amazed and ran up to Him [and] greeted Him. -- mark 9:15
.
And He asked them, About what are you questioning and discussing with them? -- mark 9:16
.
And one of the throng replied to Him, Teacher, I brought my son to You, for he has a dumb spirit. -- mark 9:17
.
And wherever it lays hold of him [so as to make him its own], it dashes him down and convulses him, and he foams [at the mouth] and grinds his teeth, and he [falls into a motionless stupor and] is wasting away. And I asked Your disciples to drive it out, and they were not able [to do it]. -- mark 9:18
.
And He answered them, O unbelieving generation [without any faith]! How long shall I [have to do] with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to Me. -- mark 9:19
.
So they brought [the boy] to Him, and when the spirit saw Him, at once it completely convulsed the boy, and he fell to the ground and kept rolling about, foaming [at the mouth]. -- mark 9:20
.
And [Jesus] asked his father, How long has he had this? And he answered, From the time he was a little boy. -- mark 9:21
.
And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water, intending to kill him. But if You can do anything, do have pity on us and help us. -- mark 9:22
.
And Jesus said, [You say to Me], If You can do anything? [Why,] all things can be (are possible) to him who believes! -- mark 9:23
.
At once the father of the boy gave [an eager, piercing, inarticulate] cry with tears, and he said, Lord, I believe! [Constantly] help my weakness of faith! -- mark 9:24
.
But when Jesus noticed that a crowd [of people] came running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, You dumb and deaf spirit, I charge you to come out of him and never go into him again. -- mark 9:25
.
And after giving a [hoarse, clamoring, fear-stricken] shriek of anguish and convulsing him terribly, it came out; and the boy lay [pale and motionless] like a corpse, so that many of them said, He is dead. -- mark 9:26
.
But Jesus took [a strong grip of] his hand and began lifting him up, and he stood. -- mark 9:27
.
And when He had gone indoors, His disciples asked Him privately, Why could not we drive it out? -- mark 9:28
.
And He replied to them, This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting. -- mark 9:29
.
They went on from there and passed along through Galilee. And He did not wish to have anyone know it, -- mark 9:30
.
For He was [engaged for the time being in] teaching His disciples. He said to them, The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men, and they will put Him to death; and when He has been killed, after three days He will rise [from death]. -- mark 9:31
.
But they did not comprehend what He was saying, and they were afraid to ask Him [what this statement meant]. -- mark 9:32
.
And they arrived at Capernaum; and when [they were] in the house, He asked them, What were you discussing and arguing about on the road? -- mark 9:33
.
But they kept still, for on the road they had discussed and disputed with one another as to who was the greatest. -- mark 9:34
.
And He sat down and called the Twelve [apostles], and He said to them, If anyone desires to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all. -- mark 9:35
.
And He took a little child and put him in the center of their group; and taking him in [His] arms, He said to them, -- mark 9:36
.
Whoever in My name and for My sake accepts and receives and welcomes one such child also accepts and receives and welcomes Me; and whoever so receives Me receives not only Me but Him Who sent Me. -- mark 9:37
.
John said to Him, Teacher, we saw a man who does not follow along with us driving out demons in Your name, and we forbade him to do it, because he is not one of our band [of Your disciples]. -- mark 9:38
.
But Jesus said, Do not restrain or hinder or forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in My name will soon afterward be able to speak evil of Me. -- mark 9:39
.
For he who is not against us is for us. -- mark 9:40
.
For I tell you truly, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to and bear the name of Christ will by no means fail to get his reward. -- mark 9:41
.
And whoever causes one of these little ones (these believers) who acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin, it would be better (more profitable and wholesome) for him if a [huge] millstone were hung about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea. -- mark 9:42
.
And if your hand puts a stumbling block before you and causes you to sin, cut it off! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to go into life [that is really worthwhile] maimed than with two hands to go to hell (Gehenna), into the fire that cannot be put out. -- mark 9:43
.
And if your foot is a cause of stumbling and sin to you, cut it off! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter into life [that is really worthwhile] crippled than, having two feet, to be cast into hell (Gehenna). -- mark 9:45
.
And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin, pluck it out! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell (Gehenna), -- mark 9:47
.
Where their worm [which preys on the inhabitants and is a symbol of the wounds inflicted on the man himself by his sins] does not die, and the fire is not put out. -- mark 9:48
.
For everyone shall be salted with fire. -- mark 9:49
.
Salt is good (beneficial), but if salt has lost its saltness, how will you restore [the saltness to] it? Have salt within yourselves, and be at peace and live in harmony with one another. -- mark 9:50
.
AND [Jesus] left there [Capernaum] and went to the region of Judea and beyond [east of] the Jordan; and crowds [constantly] gathered around Him again, and as was His custom, He began to teach them again. -- mark 10:1
.
And some Pharisees came up, and, in order to test Him and try to find a weakness in Him, asked, Is it lawful for a man to dismiss and repudiate and divorce his wife? -- mark 10:2
.
He answered them, What did Moses command you? -- mark 10:3
.
They replied, Moses allowed a man to write a bill of divorce and to put her away. -- mark 10:4
.
But Jesus said to them, Because of your hardness of heart [your condition of insensibility to the call of God] he wrote you this precept in your Law. -- mark 10:5
.
But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female. -- mark 10:6
.
For this reason a man shall leave [behind] his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and cleave closely to her permanently, -- mark 10:7
.
And the two shall become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. -- mark 10:8
.
What therefore God has united (joined together), let not man separate or divide. -- mark 10:9
.
And indoors the disciples questioned Him again about this subject. -- mark 10:10
.
And He said to them, Whoever dismisses (repudiates and divorces) his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; -- mark 10:11
.
And if a woman dismisses (repudiates and divorces) her husband and marries another, she commits adultery. -- mark 10:12
.
And they kept bringing young children to Him that He might touch them, and the disciples were reproving them [for it]. -- mark 10:13
.
But when Jesus saw [it], He was indignant and pained and said to them, Allow the children to come to Me--do not forbid or prevent or hinder them--for to such belongs the kingdom of God. -- mark 10:14
.
Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive and accept and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [does] positively shall not enter it at all. -- mark 10:15
.
And He took them [the children up one by one] in His arms and [fervently invoked a] blessing, placing His hands upon them. -- mark 10:16
.
And as He was setting out on His journey, a man ran up and knelt before Him and asked Him, Teacher, [You are essentially and perfectly morally] good, what must I do to inherit eternal life [that is, to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]? -- mark 10:17
.
And Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me [essentially and perfectly morally] good? There is no one [essentially and perfectly morally] good--except God alone. -- mark 10:18
.
You know the commandments: Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother. -- mark 10:19
.
And he replied to Him, Teacher, I have carefully guarded and observed all these and taken care not to violate them from my boyhood. -- mark 10:20
.
And Jesus, looking upon him, loved him, and He said to him, You lack one thing; go and sell all you have and give [the money] to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come [and] accompany Me [walking the same road that I walk]. -- mark 10:21
.
At that saying the man's countenance fell and was gloomy, and he went away grieved and sorrowing, for he was holding great possessions. -- mark 10:22
.
And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, With what difficulty will those who possess wealth and keep on holding it enter the kingdom of God! -- mark 10:23
.
And the disciples were amazed and bewildered and perplexed at His words. But Jesus said to them again, Children, how hard it is for those who trust (place their confidence, their sense of safety) in riches to enter the kingdom of God! -- mark 10:24
.
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. -- mark 10:25
.
And they were shocked and exceedingly astonished, and said to Him and to one another, Then who can be saved? -- mark 10:26
.
Jesus glanced around at them and said, With men [it is] impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God. -- mark 10:27
.
Peter started to say to Him, Behold, we have yielded up and abandoned everything [once and for all and joined You as Your disciples, siding with Your party] and accompanied You [walking the same road that You walk]. -- mark 10:28
.
Jesus said, Truly I tell you, there is no one who has given up and left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for My sake and for the Gospel's -- mark 10:29
.
Who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time--houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions--and in the age to come, eternal life. -- mark 10:30
.
But many [who are now] first will be last [then], and many [who are now] last will be first [then]. -- mark 10:31
.
They were on the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on in front of them; and they were bewildered and perplexed and greatly astonished, and those [who were still] following were seized with alarm and were afraid. And He took the Twelve [apostles] again and began to tell them what was about to happen to Him, -- mark 10:32
.
[Saying], Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn and sentence Him to death and turn Him over to the Gentiles. -- mark 10:33
.
And they will mock Him and spit on Him, and whip Him and put Him to death; but after three days He will rise again [from death]. -- mark 10:34
.
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him and said to Him, Teacher, we desire You to do for us whatever we ask of You. -- mark 10:35
.
And He replied to them, What do you desire Me to do for you? -- mark 10:36
.
And they said to Him, Grant that we may sit, one at Your right hand and one at [Your] left hand, in Your glory (Your majesty and splendor). -- mark 10:37
.
But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism [of affliction] with which I am baptized? -- mark 10:38
.
And they replied to Him, We are able. And Jesus told them, The cup that I drink you will drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized, -- mark 10:39
.
But to sit at My right hand or at My left hand is not Mine to give; but [it will be given to those] for whom it is ordained and prepared. -- mark 10:40
.
And when the other ten [apostles] heard it, they began to be indignant with James and John. -- mark 10:41
.
But Jesus called them to [Him] and said to them, You know that those who are recognized as governing and are supposed to rule the Gentiles (the nations) lord it over them [ruling with absolute power, holding them in subjection], and their great men exercise authority and dominion over them. -- mark 10:42
.
But this is not to be so among you; instead, whoever desires to be great among you must be your servant, -- mark 10:43
.
And whoever wishes to be most important and first in rank among you must be slave of all. -- mark 10:44
.
For even the Son of Man came not to have service rendered to Him, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for (instead of) many. -- mark 10:45
.
Then they came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, a son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. -- mark 10:46
.
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity and mercy on me [now]! -- mark 10:47
.
And many severely censured and reproved him, telling him to keep still, but he kept on shouting out all the more, You Son of David, have pity and mercy on me [now]! -- mark 10:48
.
And Jesus stopped and said, Call him. And they called the blind man, telling him, Take courage! Get up! He is calling you. -- mark 10:49
.
And throwing off his outer garment, he leaped up and came to Jesus. -- mark 10:50
.
And Jesus said to him, What do you want Me to do for you? And the blind man said to Him, Master, let me receive my sight. -- mark 10:51
.
And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has healed you. And at once he received his sight and accompanied Jesus on the road. -- mark 10:52
.
WHEN THEY were getting near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, He sent ahead two of His disciples -- mark 11:1
.
And instructed them, Go into the village in front of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied, which has never been ridden by anyone; unfasten it and bring it [here]. -- mark 11:2
.
If anyone asks you, Why are you doing this? answer, The Lord needs it, and He will send it back here presently. -- mark 11:3
.
So they went away and found a colt tied at the door out in the [winding] open street, and they loosed it. -- mark 11:4
.
And some who were standing there said to them, What are you doing, untying the colt? -- mark 11:5
.
And they replied as Jesus had directed them, and they allowed them to go. -- mark 11:6
.
And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their outer garments upon it, and He sat on it. -- mark 11:7
.
And many [of the people] spread their garments on the road, and others [scattered a layer of] leafy branches which they had cut from the fields. -- mark 11:8
.
And those who went before and those who followed cried out [with a cry of happiness], Hosanna! [Be graciously inclined and propitious to Him!] Praised and blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord! -- mark 11:9
.
Praised and blessed in the name of the Lord is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna (O save us) in the highest [heaven]! -- mark 11:10
.
And Jesus went into Jerusalem and entered the temple [enclosure]; and when He had looked around, surveying and observing everything, as it was already late, He went out to Bethany together with the Twelve [apostles]. -- mark 11:11
.
On the day following, when they had come away from Bethany, He was hungry. -- mark 11:12
.
And seeing in the distance a fig tree [covered] with leaves, He went to see if He could find any [fruit] on it [for in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves]. But when He came up to it, He found nothing but leaves, for the fig season had not yet come. -- mark 11:13
.
And He said to it, No one ever again shall eat fruit from you. And His disciples were listening [to what He said]. -- mark 11:14
.
And they came to Jerusalem. And He went into the temple [area, the porches and courts] and began to drive out those who sold and bought in the temple area, and He overturned the [four-footed] tables of the money changers and the seats of those who dealt in doves; -- mark 11:15
.
And He would not permit anyone to carry any household equipment through the temple enclosure [thus making the temple area a short-cut traffic lane]. -- mark 11:16
.
And He taught and said to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have turned it into a den of robbers. -- mark 11:17
.
And the chief priests and the scribes heard [of this] and kept seeking some way to destroy Him, for they feared Him, because the entire multitude was struck with astonishment at His teaching. -- mark 11:18
.
And when evening came on, He and His disciples, as accustomed, went out of the city. -- mark 11:19
.
In the morning, when they were passing along, they noticed that the fig tree was withered [completely] away to its roots. -- mark 11:20
.
And Peter remembered and said to Him, Master, look! The fig tree which You doomed has withered away! -- mark 11:21
.
And Jesus, replying, said to them, Have faith in God [constantly]. -- mark 11:22
.
Truly I tell you, whoever says to this mountain, Be lifted up and thrown into the sea! and does not doubt at all in his heart but believes that what he says will take place, it will be done for him. -- mark 11:23
.
For this reason I am telling you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe (trust and be confident) that it is granted to you, and you will [get it]. -- mark 11:24
.
And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him and let it drop (leave it, let it go), in order that your Father Who is in heaven may also forgive you your [own] failings and shortcomings and let them drop. -- mark 11:25
.
But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your failings and shortcomings. -- mark 11:26
.
And they came again to Jerusalem. And when Jesus was walking about in the [courts and porches of the] temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him, -- mark 11:27
.
And they kept saying to Him, By what [sort of] authority are You doing these things, or who gave You this authority to do them? -- mark 11:28
.
Jesus told them, I will ask you a question. Answer Me, and then I will tell you by what [sort of] authority I do these things. -- mark 11:29
.
Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer Me. -- mark 11:30
.
And they reasoned and argued with one another, If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him? -- mark 11:31
.
But [on the other hand] can we say, From men? For they were afraid of the people, because everybody considered and held John actually to be a prophet. -- mark 11:32
.
So they replied to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus said to them, Neither am I going to tell you what [sort of] authority I have for doing these things. -- mark 11:33
.
AND [Jesus] started to speak to them in parables [with comparisons and illustrations]. A man planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower and let it out [for rent] to vinedressers and went into another country. -- mark 12:1
.
When the season came, he sent a bond servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. -- mark 12:2
.
But they took him and beat him and sent him away without anything. -- mark 12:3
.
Again he sent to them another bond servant, and they stoned him and wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully [sending him away with insults]. -- mark 12:4
.
And he sent another, and that one they killed; then many others--some they beat, and some they put to death. -- mark 12:5
.
He had still one left [to send], a beloved son; last of all he sent him to them, saying, They will respect my son. -- mark 12:6
.
But those tenants said to one another, Here is the heir; come on, let us put him to death, and [then] the inheritance will be ours. -- mark 12:7
.
And they took him and killed him, and threw [his body] outside the vineyard. -- mark 12:8
.
Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others. -- mark 12:9
.
Have you not even read this [passage of] Scripture: The very Stone which [after putting It to the test] the builders rejected has become the Head of the corner [Cornerstone]; -- mark 12:10
.
This is from the Lord and is His doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes? -- mark 12:11
.
And they were trying to get hold of Him, but they were afraid of the people, for they knew that He spoke this parable with reference to and against them. So they left Him and departed. -- mark 12:12
.
But they sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him for the purpose of entrapping Him in His speech. -- mark 12:13
.
And they came up and said to Him, Teacher, we know that You are sincere and what You profess to be, that You cannot lie, and that You have no personal bias for anyone; for You are not influenced by partiality and have no regard for anyone's external condition or position, but in [and on the basis of] truth You teach the way of God. Is it lawful (permissible and right) to give tribute (poll taxes) to Caesar or not? -- mark 12:14
.
Should we pay [them] or should we not pay [them]? But knowing their hypocrisy, He asked them, Why do you put Me to the test? Bring Me a coin (a denarius), so I may see it. -- mark 12:15
.
And they brought [Him one]. Then He asked them, Whose image (picture) is this? And whose superscription (title)? They said to Him, Caesar's. -- mark 12:16
.
Jesus said to them, Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's. And they stood marveling and greatly amazed at Him. -- mark 12:17
.
And [some] Sadducees came to Him, [of that party] who say there is no resurrection, and they asked Him a question, saying, -- mark 12:18
.
Teacher, Moses gave us [a law] that if a man's brother died, leaving a wife but no child, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. -- mark 12:19
.
Now there were seven brothers; the first one took a wife and died, leaving no children. -- mark 12:20
.
And the second [brother] married her, and died, leaving no children; and the third did the same; -- mark 12:21
.
And all seven, leaving no children. Last of all, the woman died also. -- mark 12:22
.
Now in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For the seven were married to her. -- mark 12:23
.
Jesus said to them, Is not this where you wander out of the way and go wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God? -- mark 12:24
.
For when they arise from among the dead, [men] do not marry nor are [women] given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven. -- mark 12:25
.
But concerning the dead being raised--have you not read in the book of Moses, [in the passage] about the [burning] bush, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? -- mark 12:26
.
He is not the God of [the] dead, but of [the] living! You are very wrong. -- mark 12:27
.
Then one of the scribes came up and listened to them disputing with one another, and, noticing that Jesus answered them fitly and admirably, he asked Him, Which commandment is first and most important of all [in its nature]? -- mark 12:28
.
Jesus answered, The first and principal one of all commands is: Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord; -- mark 12:29
.
And you shall love the Lord your God out of and with your whole heart and out of and with all your soul (your life) and out of and with all your mind (with your faculty of thought and your moral understanding) and out of and with all your strength. This is the first and principal commandment. -- mark 12:30
.
The second is like it and is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. -- mark 12:31
.
And the scribe said to Him, Excellently and fitly and admirably answered, Teacher! You have said truly that He is One, and there is no other but Him; -- mark 12:32
.
And to love Him out of and with all the heart and with all the understanding [with the faculty of quick apprehension and intelligence and keenness of discernment] and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. [I Sam. 15:22; Hos. 6:6; Mic. 6:6-8; Heb. 10:8.] -- mark 12:33
.
And when Jesus saw that he answered intelligently (discreetly and having his wits about him), He said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no one ventured or dared to ask Him any further question. -- mark 12:34
.
And as Jesus taught in [a porch or court of] the temple, He said, How can the scribes say that the Christ is David's Son? -- mark 12:35
.
David himself, [inspired] in the Holy Spirit, declared, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies [a footstool] under Your feet. -- mark 12:36
.
David himself calls Him Lord; so how can it be that He is his Son? Now the great mass of the people heard [Jesus] gladly [listening to Him with delight]. -- mark 12:37
.
And in [the course of] His teaching, He said, Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes and [to get] greetings in the marketplaces [public forums], -- mark 12:38
.
And [have] the front seats in the synagogues and the chief couches (places of honor) at feasts, -- mark 12:39
.
Who devour widows' houses and to cover it up make long prayers. They will receive the heavier [sentence of] condemnation. -- mark 12:40
.
And He sat down opposite the treasury and saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury. Many rich [people] were throwing in large sums. -- mark 12:41
.
And a widow who was poverty-stricken came and put in two copper mites [the smallest of coins], which together make half of a cent. -- mark 12:42
.
And He called His disciples [to Him] and said to them, Truly and surely I tell you, this widow, [she who is] poverty-stricken, has put in more than all those contributing to the treasury. -- mark 12:43
.
For they all threw in out of their abundance; but she, out of her deep poverty, has put in everything that she had--[even] all she had on which to live. -- mark 12:44
.
AND AS [Jesus] was coming out of the temple [area], one of His disciples said to Him, Look, Teacher! Notice the sort and quality of these stones and buildings! -- mark 13:1
.
And Jesus replied to him, You see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be loosened and torn down. -- mark 13:2
.
And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple [enclosure], Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately, -- mark 13:3
.
Tell us when is this to take place and what will be the sign when these things, all [of them], are about to be accomplished? -- mark 13:4
.
And Jesus began to tell them, Be careful and watchful that no one misleads you [about it]. -- mark 13:5
.
Many will come in [appropriating to themselves] the name [of Messiah] which belongs to Me [basing their claims on the use of My name], saying, I am [He]! And they will mislead many. -- mark 13:6
.
And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not get alarmed (troubled and frightened); it is necessary [that these things] take place, but the end is not yet. -- mark 13:7
.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines and calamities. This is but the beginning of the intolerable anguish and suffering [only the first of the birth pangs]. -- mark 13:8
.
But look to yourselves; for they will turn you over to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake as a testimony to them. -- mark 13:9
.
And the good news (the Gospel) must first be preached to all nations. -- mark 13:10
.
Now when they take you [to court] and put you under arrest, do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say nor [even ] meditate about it; but say whatever is given you in that hour and at the moment, for it is not you who will be speaking, but the Holy Spirit. -- mark 13:11
.
And brother will hand over brother to death, and the father his child; and children will take a stand against their parents and [have] them put to death. -- mark 13:12
.
And you will be hated and detested by everybody for My name's sake, but he who patiently perseveres and endures to the end will be saved (made a partaker of the salvation by Christ, and delivered from spiritual death). -- mark 13:13
.
But when you see the abomination of desolation mentioned by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not to be--[and] let the one who reads take notice and consider and understand and heed [this]--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. -- mark 13:14
.
Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house nor go inside to take anything out of his house; -- mark 13:15
.
And let him who is in the field not turn back again to get his mantle (cloak). -- mark 13:16
.
And alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days! -- mark 13:17
.
Pray that it may not occur in winter, -- mark 13:18
.
For at that time there will be such affliction (oppression and tribulation) as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until this particular time--and positively never will be [again]. -- mark 13:19
.
And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no human being would be saved (rescued); but for the sake of the elect, His chosen ones (those whom He picked out for Himself), He has shortened the days. -- mark 13:20
.
And then if anyone says to you, See, here is the Christ (the Messiah)! or, Look, there He is! do not believe it. -- mark 13:21
.
False Christs (Messiahs) and false prophets will arise and show signs and [work] miracles to deceive and lead astray, if possible, even the elect (those God has chosen out for Himself). -- mark 13:22
.
But look to yourselves and be on your guard; I have told you everything beforehand. -- mark 13:23
.
But in those days, after [the affliction and oppression and distress of] that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; -- mark 13:24
.
And the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. -- mark 13:25
.
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great (kingly) power and glory (majesty and splendor). -- mark 13:26
.
And then He will send out the angels and will gather together His elect (those He has picked out for Himself) from the four winds, from the farthest bounds of the earth to the farthest bounds of heaven. -- mark 13:27
.
Now learn a lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and it puts forth its leaves, you recognize and know that summer is near. -- mark 13:28
.
So also, when you see these things happening, you may recognize and know that He is near, at [the very] door. -- mark 13:29
.
Surely I say to you, this generation (the whole multitude of people living at that one time) positively will not perish or pass away before all these things take place. -- mark 13:30
.
Heaven and earth will perish and pass away, but My words will not perish or pass away. -- mark 13:31
.
But of that day or that hour not a [single] person knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. -- mark 13:32
.
Be on your guard [constantly alert], and watch and pray; for you do not know when the time will come. -- mark 13:33
.
It is like a man [already] going on a journey; when he leaves home, he puts his servants in charge, each with his particular task, and he gives orders to the doorkeeper to be constantly alert and on the watch. -- mark 13:34
.
Therefore watch (give strict attention, be cautious and alert), for you do not know when the Master of the house is coming--in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning-- -- mark 13:35
.
[Watch, I say] lest He come suddenly and unexpectedly and find you asleep. -- mark 13:36
.
And what I say to you I say to everybody: Watch (give strict attention, be cautious, active, and alert)! -- mark 13:37
.
IT WAS now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes were all the while seeking to arrest [Jesus] by secrecy and deceit and put [Him] to death, -- mark 14:1
.
For they kept saying, It must not be during the Feast, for fear that there might be a riot of the people. -- mark 14:2
.
And while He was in Bethany, [a guest] in the house of Simon the leper, as He was reclining [at table], a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment (perfume) of pure nard, very costly and precious; and she broke the jar and poured [the perfume] over His head. -- mark 14:3
.
But there were some who were moved with indignation and said to themselves, To what purpose was the ointment (perfume) thus wasted? -- mark 14:4
.
For it was possible to have sold this [perfume] for more than denarii [a laboring man's wages for a year] and to have given [the money] to the poor. And they censured and reproved her. -- mark 14:5
.
But Jesus said, Let her alone; why are you troubling her? She has done a good and beautiful thing to Me [praiseworthy and noble]. -- mark 14:6
.
For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you will not always have Me. -- mark 14:7
.
She has done what she could; she came beforehand to anoint My body for the burial. -- mark 14:8
.
And surely I tell you, wherever the good news (the Gospel) is proclaimed in the entire world, what she has done will be told in memory of her. -- mark 14:9
.
Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve [apostles], went off to the chief priests in order to betray and hand Him over to them. -- mark 14:10
.
And when they heard it, they rejoiced and were delighted, and they promised to give him money. And he [busying himself continually] sought an opportunity to betray Him. -- mark 14:11
.
On the first day [of the Feast] of Unleavened Bread, when [as was customary] they killed the Passover lamb, [Jesus'] disciples said to Him, Where do You wish us to go [and] prepare the Passover [supper] for You to eat? -- mark 14:12
.
And He sent two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying an [earthen] jar or pitcher of water will meet you; follow him. -- mark 14:13
.
And whatever [house] he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says: Where is My guest room, where I may eat the Passover [supper] with My disciples? -- mark 14:14
.
And he will [himself] show you a large upper room, furnished [with carpets and with dining couches properly spread] and ready; there prepare for us. -- mark 14:15
.
Then the disciples set out and came to the city and found [everything] just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover. -- mark 14:16
.
And when it was evening, He came with the Twelve [apostles]. -- mark 14:17
.
And while they were at the table eating, Jesus said, Surely I say to you, one of you will betray Me, [one] who is eating [here] with Me. -- mark 14:18
.
And they began to show that they were sad and hurt, and to say to Him one after another, Is it I? or, It is not I, is it? -- mark 14:19
.
He replied to them, It is one of the Twelve [apostles], one who is dipping [bread] into the [same deep] dish with Me. -- mark 14:20
.
For the Son of Man is going as it stands written concerning Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good (profitable and wholesome) for that man if he had never been born. -- mark 14:21
.
And while they were eating, He took a loaf [of bread], praised God and gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use. [Then] He broke [it] and gave to them and said, Take. Eat. This is My body. -- mark 14:22
.
He also took a cup [of the juice of grapes], and when He had given thanks, He gave [it] to them, and they all drank of it. -- mark 14:23
.
And He said to them, This is My blood [which ratifies] the new covenant, [the blood] which is being poured out for (on account of) many. -- mark 14:24
.
Solemnly and surely I tell you, I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine till that day when I drink it of a new and a higher quality in God's kingdom. -- mark 14:25
.
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. -- mark 14:26
.
And Jesus said to them, You will all fall away this night [that is, you will be caused to stumble and will begin to distrust and desert Me], for it stands written, I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered. -- mark 14:27
.
But after I am raised [to life], I will go before you into Galilee. -- mark 14:28
.
But Peter said to Him, Even if they all fall away and are caused to stumble and distrust and desert You, yet I will not [do so]! -- mark 14:29
.
And Jesus said to him, Truly I tell you, this very night, before a cock crows twice, you will utterly deny Me [disclaiming all connection with Me] three times. -- mark 14:30
.
But [Peter] said more vehemently and repeatedly, [Even] if it should be necessary for me to die with You, I will not deny or disown You! And they all kept saying the same thing. -- mark 14:31
.
Then they went to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples, Sit down here while I pray. -- mark 14:32
.
And He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be struck with terror and amazement and deeply troubled and depressed. -- mark 14:33
.
And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sad (overwhelmed with grief) so that it almost kills Me! Remain here and keep awake and be watching. -- mark 14:34
.
And going a little farther, He fell on the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the [fatal] hour might pass from Him. -- mark 14:35
.
And He was saying, Abba, [which means] Father, everything is possible for You. Take away this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You [will]. -- mark 14:36
.
And He came back and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter, Simon, are you asleep? Have you not the strength to keep awake and watch [with Me for] one hour? -- mark 14:37
.
Keep awake and watch and pray [constantly], that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. -- mark 14:38
.
He went away again and prayed, saying the same words. -- mark 14:39
.
And again He came back and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what answer to give Him. -- mark 14:40
.
And He came back a third time and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough [of that]! The hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinful men (men whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God). -- mark 14:41
.
Get up, let us be going! See, My betrayer is at hand! -- mark 14:42
.
And at once, while He was still speaking, Judas came, one of the Twelve [apostles], and with him a crowd of men with swords and clubs, [who came] from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders [of the Sanhedrin]. -- mark 14:43
.
Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, The One I shall kiss is [the Man]; seize Him and lead [Him] away safely [so as to prevent His escape]. -- mark 14:44
.
And when he came, he went up to Jesus immediately and said, Master! Master! and he embraced Him and kissed Him fervently. -- mark 14:45
.
And they threw their hands on Him and arrested Him. -- mark 14:46
.
But one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. -- mark 14:47
.
And Jesus said to them, Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber to capture Me? -- mark 14:48
.
I was with you daily in the temple [porches and courts] teaching, and you did not seize Me; but [this has happened] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. -- mark 14:49
.
Then [His disciples], forsaking Him, fled, all [of them]. -- mark 14:50
.
And a young man was following Him, with nothing but a linen cloth (sheet) thrown about [his] naked [body]; and they laid hold of him, -- mark 14:51
.
But, leaving behind the linen cloth (sheet), he fled from them naked. -- mark 14:52
.
And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were gathered together. -- mark 14:53
.
And Peter followed Him at a distance, even right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting [in the firelight] with the guards and warming himself at the fire. -- mark 14:54
.
Now the chief priests and the entire council (the Sanhedrin) were constantly seeking [to get] testimony against Jesus with a view to condemning Him and putting Him to death, but they did not find any. -- mark 14:55
.
For many were repeatedly bearing false witness against Him, but their testimonies did not agree. -- mark 14:56
.
And some stood up and were bearing false witness against Him, saying, -- mark 14:57
.
We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple (sanctuary) which is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, made without hands. -- mark 14:58
.
Still not even [in this] did their testimony agree. -- mark 14:59
.
And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, Have You not even one answer to make? What [about this which] these [men] are testifying against You? -- mark 14:60
.
But He kept still and did not answer at all. Again the high priest asked Him, Are You the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One), the Son of the Blessed? -- mark 14:61
.
And Jesus said, I AM; and you will [all] see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power (the Almighty) and coming on the clouds of heaven. -- mark 14:62
.
Then the high priest tore his garments and said, What need have we for more witnesses? -- mark 14:63
.
You have heard His blasphemy. What is your decision? And they all condemned Him as being guilty and deserving of death. -- mark 14:64
.
And some of them began to spit on Him and to blindfold Him and to strike Him with their fists, saying to Him, Prophesy! And the guards received Him with blows and by slapping Him. -- mark 14:65
.
While Peter was down below in the courtyard, one of the [serving] maids of the high priest came; -- mark 14:66
.
And when she saw Peter warming himself, she gazed intently at him and said, You were with Jesus of Nazareth too. -- mark 14:67
.
But he denied it falsely and disowned Him, saying, I neither know nor understand what you say. Then he went outside [the courtyard and was] into the vestibule. And a cock crowed. -- mark 14:68
.
And the maidservant saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders, This [man] is [one] of them. -- mark 14:69
.
But again he denied it falsely and disowned Him. And after a short while, again the bystanders said to Peter, Really, you are one of them, for you are a Galilean and your dialect shows it. -- mark 14:70
.
Then he commenced invoking a curse on himself [should he not be telling the truth] and swearing, I do not know the Man about Whom you are talking! -- mark 14:71
.
And at once for the second time a cock crowed. And Peter remembered how Jesus said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will utterly deny Me [disclaiming all connection with Me] three times. And having put his thought upon it [and remembering], he broke down and wept aloud and lamented. -- mark 14:72
.
AND IMMEDIATELY when it was morning, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and the whole council, held a consultation; and when they had bound Jesus, they took Him away [violently] and handed Him over to Pilate. -- mark 15:1
.
And Pilate inquired of Him, Are You the King of the Jews? And He replied, It is as you say. -- mark 15:2
.
And the chief priests kept accusing Him of many things. -- mark 15:3
.
And Pilate again asked Him, Have You no answer to make? See how many charges they are bringing against You! -- mark 15:4
.
But Jesus made no further answer at all, so that Pilate wondered and marveled. -- mark 15:5
.
Now at the Feast he [was accustomed to] set free for them any one prisoner whom they requested. -- mark 15:6
.
And among the rioters in the prison who had committed murder in the insurrection there was a man named Barabbas. -- mark 15:7
.
And the throng came up and began asking Pilate to do as he usually did for them. -- mark 15:8
.
And he replied to them, Do you wish me to set free for you the King of the Jews? -- mark 15:9
.
For he was aware that it was [because they were prompted] by envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up. -- mark 15:10
.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release for them Barabbas instead. -- mark 15:11
.
And again Pilate said to them, Then what shall I do with the Man Whom you call the King of the Jews? -- mark 15:12
.
And they shouted back again, Crucify Him! -- mark 15:13
.
But Pilate said to them, Why? What has He done that is evil? But they shouted with all their might all the more, Crucify Him [at once]! -- mark 15:14
.
So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, set Barabbas free for them; and after having Jesus whipped, he handed [Him] over to be crucified. -- mark 15:15
.
Then the soldiers led Him away to the courtyard inside the palace, that is, the Praetorium, and they called the entire detachment of soldiers together. -- mark 15:16
.
And they dressed Him in  purple [robe], and, weaving together a crown of thorns, they placed it on Him. -- mark 15:17
.
And they began to salute Him, Hail (greetings, good health to You, long life to You), King of the Jews! -- mark 15:18
.
And they struck His head with a staff made of a [bamboo-like] reed and spat on Him and kept bowing their knees in homage to Him. -- mark 15:19
.
And when they had [finished] making sport of Him, they took the purple [robe] off of Him and put His own clothes on Him. And they led Him out [of the city] to crucify Him. -- mark 15:20
.
And they forced a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who was coming in from the field (country), to carry His cross. -- mark 15:21
.
And they led Him to Golgotha [in Latin: Calvary], meaning The Place of a Skull. -- mark 15:22
.
And they [attempted to] give Him wine mingled with myrrh, but He would not take it. -- mark 15:23
.
And they crucified Him; and they divided His garments and distributed them among themselves, throwing lots for them to decide who should take what. -- mark 15:24
.
And it was the third hour (about nine o'clock in the morning) when they crucified Him. -- mark 15:25
.
And the inscription of the accusation against Him was written above, The King of the Jews. -- mark 15:26
.
And with Him they crucified two robbers, one on [His] right hand and one on His left. -- mark 15:27
.
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, He was counted among the transgressors. -- mark 15:28
.
And those who passed by kept reviling Him and reproaching Him abusively in harsh and insolent language, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You Who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, -- mark 15:29
.
Now rescue Yourself [from death], coming down from the cross! -- mark 15:30
.
So also the chief priests, with the scribes, made sport of Him to one another, saying, He rescued others [from death]; Himself He is unable to rescue. -- mark 15:31
.
Let the Christ (the Messiah), the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see [it] and trust in and rely on Him and adhere to Him! Those who were crucified with Him also reviled and reproached Him [speaking abusively, harshly, and insolently]. -- mark 15:32
.
And when the sixth hour (about midday) had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour (about three o'clock). -- mark 15:33
.
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?--which means, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me [deserting Me and leaving Me helpless and abandoned]? -- mark 15:34
.
And some of those standing by, [and] hearing it, said, See! He is calling Elijah! -- mark 15:35
.
And one man ran, and, filling a sponge with vinegar (a mixture of sour wine and water), put it on a staff made of a [bamboo-like] reed and gave it to Him to drink, saying, Hold off! Let us see whether Elijah [does] come to take Him down. -- mark 15:36
.
And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed out His life. -- mark 15:37
.
And the curtain [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. -- mark 15:38
.
And when the centurion who stood facing Him saw Him expire this way, he said, Really, this Man was God's Son! -- mark 15:39
.
Now some women were there also, looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, -- mark 15:40
.
Who, when [Jesus] was in Galilee, were in the habit of accompanying and ministering to Him; and [there were] also many other [women] who had come up with Him to Jerusalem. -- mark 15:41
.
As evening had already come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, [the day] before the Sabbath, -- mark 15:42
.
Joseph, he of Arimathea, noble and honorable in rank and a respected member of the council (Sanhedrin), who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, daring the consequences, took courage and ventured to go to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. -- mark 15:43
.
But Pilate wondered whether He was dead so soon, and, having called the centurion, he asked him whether [Jesus] was already dead. -- mark 15:44
.
And when he learned from the centurion [that He was indeed dead], he gave the body to Joseph. -- mark 15:45
.
And Joseph bought a [fine] linen cloth [for swathing dead bodies], and, taking Him down from the cross, he rolled Him up in the [fine] linen cloth and placed Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock. Then he rolled a [very large] stone against the door of the tomb. -- mark 15:46
.
And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses were [attentively] observing where He was laid. -- mark 15:47
.
AND WHEN the Sabbath was past [that is, after the sun had set], Mary Magdalene, and Mary [the mother] of James, and Salome purchased sweet-smelling spices, so that they might go and anoint [Jesus' body]. -- mark 16:1
.
And very early on the first day of the week they came to the tomb; [by then] the sun had risen. -- mark 16:2
.
And they said to one another, Who will roll back the stone for us out of [the groove across the floor at] the door of the tomb? -- mark 16:3
.
And when they looked up, they [distinctly] saw that the stone was already rolled back, for it was very large. -- mark 16:4
.
And going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting [there] on the right [side], clothed in a [long, stately, sweeping] robe of white, and they were utterly amazed and struck with terror. -- mark 16:5
.
And he said to them, Do not be amazed and terrified; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, Who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him. -- mark 16:6
.
But be going; tell the disciples and Peter, He goes before you into Galilee; you will see Him there, [just] as He told you. -- mark 16:7
.
Then they went out [and] fled from the tomb, for trembling and bewilderment and consternation had seized them. And they said nothing about it to anyone, for they were held by alarm and fear. -- mark 16:8
.
Now Jesus, having risen [from death] early on the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had driven out seven demons. -- mark 16:9
.
She went and reported it to those who had been with Him, as they grieved and wept. -- mark 16:10
.
And when they heard that He was alive and that she had seen Him, they did not believe it. -- mark 16:11
.
After this, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking [along the way] into the country. -- mark 16:12
.
And they returned [to Jerusalem] and told the others, but they did not believe them either. -- mark 16:13
.
Afterward He appeared to the Eleven [apostles themselves] as they reclined at table; and He reproved and reproached them for their unbelief (their lack of faith) and their hardness of heart, because they had refused to believe those who had seen Him and looked at Him attentively after He had risen [from death]. -- mark 16:14
.
And He said to them, Go into all the world and preach and publish openly the good news (the Gospel) to every creature [of the whole human race]. -- mark 16:15
.
He who believes [who adheres to and trusts in and relies on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] and is baptized will be saved [from the penalty of eternal death]; but he who does not believe [who does not adhere to and trust in and rely on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] will be condemned. -- mark 16:16
.
And these attesting signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages; -- mark 16:17
.
They will pick up serpents; and [even] if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will get well. -- mark 16:18
.
So then the Lord Jesus, after He had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and He sat down at the right hand of God. -- mark 16:19
.
And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the attesting signs and miracles that closely accompanied [it]. Amen (so be it). -- mark 16:20
.
SINCE [as is well known] many have undertaken to put in order and draw up a [thorough] narrative of the surely established deeds which have been accomplished and fulfilled in and among us, -- luke 1:1
.
Exactly as they were handed down to us by those who from the [official] beginning [of Jesus' ministry] were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word [that is, of the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God], -- luke 1:2
.
It seemed good and desirable to me, [and so I have determined] also after having searched out diligently and followed all things closely and traced accurately the course from the highest to the minutest detail from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, -- luke 1:3
.
[My purpose is] that you may know the full truth and understand with certainty and security against error the accounts (histories) and doctrines of the faith of which you have been informed and in which you have been orally instructed. -- luke 1:4
.
In the days when Herod was king of Judea there was a certain priest whose name was Zachariah, of the daily service (the division) of Abia; and his wife was also a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. -- luke 1:5
.
And they both were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord. -- luke 1:6
.
But they had no child, for Elizabeth was barren; and both were far advanced in years. -- luke 1:7
.
Now while on duty, serving as priest before God in the order of his division, -- luke 1:8
.
As was the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter [the sanctuary of] the temple of the Lord and burn incense. -- luke 1:9
.
And all the throng of people were praying outside [in the court] at the hour of incense [burning]. -- luke 1:10
.
And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. -- luke 1:11
.
And when Zachariah saw him, he was troubled, and fear took possession of him. -- luke 1:12
.
But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition was heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you must call his name John [God is favorable]. -- luke 1:13
.
And you shall have joy and exultant delight, and many will rejoice over his birth, -- luke 1:14
.
For he will be great and distinguished in the sight of the Lord. And he must drink no wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit even in and from his mother's womb. -- luke 1:15
.
And he will turn back and cause to return many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God, -- luke 1:16
.
And he will [himself] go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient and incredulous and unpersuadable to the wisdom of the upright [which is the knowledge and holy love of the will of God]--in order to make ready for the Lord a people [perfectly] prepared [in spirit, adjusted and disposed and placed in the right moral state]. -- luke 1:17
.
And Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know and be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years. -- luke 1:18
.
And the angel replied to him, I am Gabriel. I stand in the [very] presence of God, and I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news. -- luke 1:19
.
Now behold, you will be and will continue to be silent and not able to speak till the day when these things take place, because you have not believed what I told you; but my words are of a kind which will be fulfilled in the appointed and proper time. -- luke 1:20
.
Now the people kept waiting for Zachariah, and they wondered at his delaying [so long] in the sanctuary. -- luke 1:21
.
But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them; and they [clearly] perceived that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary; and he kept making signs to them, still he remained dumb. -- luke 1:22
.
And when his time of performing priestly functions was ended, he returned to his [own] house. -- luke 1:23
.
Now after this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, and for five months she secluded herself entirely, saying, [I have hid myself] -- luke 1:24
.
Because thus the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He deigned to look on me to take away my reproach among men. -- luke 1:25
.
Now in the sixth month [after that], the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named Nazareth, -- luke 1:26
.
To a girl never having been married and a virgin engaged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, a descendant of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. -- luke 1:27
.
And he came to her and said, Hail, O favored one [endued with grace]! The Lord is with you! Blessed (favored of God) are you before all other women! -- luke 1:28
.
But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled and disturbed and confused at what he said and kept revolving in her mind what such a greeting might mean. -- luke 1:29
.
And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found grace (free, spontaneous, absolute favor and loving-kindness) with God. -- luke 1:30
.
And listen! You will become pregnant and will give birth to a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus. -- luke 1:31
.
He will be great (eminent) and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His forefather David, -- luke 1:32
.
And He will reign over the house of Jacob throughout the ages; and of His reign there will be no end. -- luke 1:33
.
And Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I have no [intimacy with any man as a] husband? -- luke 1:34
.
Then the angel said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you [like a shining cloud]; and so the holy (pure, sinless) Thing (Offspring) which shall be born of you will be called the Son of God. -- luke 1:35
.
And listen! Your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is now the sixth month with her who was called barren. -- luke 1:36
.
For with God nothing is ever impossible and no word from God shall be without power or impossible of fulfillment. -- luke 1:37
.
Then Mary said, Behold, I am the handmaiden of the Lord; let it be done to me according to what you have said. And the angel left her. -- luke 1:38
.
And at that time Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country to a town of Judah, -- luke 1:39
.
And she went to the house of Zachariah and, entering it, saluted Elizabeth. -- luke 1:40
.
And it occurred that when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit. -- luke 1:41
.
And she cried out with a loud cry, and then exclaimed, Blessed (favored of God) above all other women are you! And blessed (favored of God) is the Fruit of your womb! -- luke 1:42
.
And how [have I deserved that this honor should] be granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? -- luke 1:43
.
For behold, the instant the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. -- luke 1:44
.
And blessed (happy, to be envied) is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her from the Lord. -- luke 1:45
.
And Mary said, My soul magnifies and extols the Lord, -- luke 1:46
.
And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, -- luke 1:47
.
For He has looked upon the low station and humiliation of His handmaiden. For behold, from now on all generations [of all ages] will call me blessed and declare me happy and to be envied! -- luke 1:48
.
For He Who is almighty has done great things for me--and holy is His name [to be venerated in His purity, majesty and glory]! -- luke 1:49
.
And His mercy (His compassion and kindness toward the miserable and afflicted) is on those who fear Him with godly reverence, from generation to generation and age to age. -- luke 1:50
.
He has shown strength and made might with His arm; He has scattered the proud and haughty in and by the imagination and purpose and designs of their hearts. -- luke 1:51
.
He has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of low degree. -- luke 1:52
.
He has filled and satisfied the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty-handed [without a gift]. -- luke 1:53
.
He has laid hold on His servant Israel [to help him, to espouse his cause], in remembrance of His mercy, -- luke 1:54
.
Even as He promised to our forefathers, to Abraham and to his descendants forever. -- luke 1:55
.
And Mary remained with her [Elizabeth] for about three months and [then] returned to her [own] home. -- luke 1:56
.
Now the time that Elizabeth should be delivered came, and she gave birth to a son. -- luke 1:57
.
And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy on her, and they rejoiced with her. -- luke 1:58
.
And it occurred that on the eighth day, when they came to circumcise the child, they were intending to call him Zachariah after his father, -- luke 1:59
.
But his mother answered, Not so! But he shall be called John. -- luke 1:60
.
And they said to her, None of your relatives is called by that name. -- luke 1:61
.
And they inquired with signs to his father [as to] what he wanted to have him called. -- luke 1:62
.
Then Zachariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote, His name is John. And they were all astonished. -- luke 1:63
.
And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak, blessing and praising and thanking God. -- luke 1:64
.
And awe and reverential fear came on all their neighbors; and all these things were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea. -- luke 1:65
.
And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, Whatever will this little boy be then? For the hand of the Lord was [so evidently] with him [protecting and aiding him]. -- luke 1:66
.
Now Zachariah his father was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, -- luke 1:67
.
Blessed (praised and extolled and thanked) be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has come and brought deliverance and redemption to His people! -- luke 1:68
.
And He has raised up a Horn of salvation [a mighty and valiant Helper, the Author of salvation] for us in the house of David His servant-- -- luke 1:69
.
This is as He promised by the mouth of His holy prophets from the most ancient times [in the memory of man]-- -- luke 1:70
.
That we should have deliverance and be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who detest and pursue us with hatred; -- luke 1:71
.
To make true and show the mercy and compassion and kindness [promised] to our forefathers and to remember and carry out His holy covenant [to bless, which is all the more sacred because it is made by God Himself], -- luke 1:72
.
That covenant He sealed by oath to our forefather Abraham: -- luke 1:73
.
To grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our foes, might serve Him fearlessly -- luke 1:74
.
In holiness (divine consecration) and righteousness [in accordance with the everlasting principles of right] within His presence all the days of our lives. -- luke 1:75
.
And you, little one, shall be called a prophet of the Most High; for you shall go on before the face of the Lord to make ready His ways, -- luke 1:76
.
To bring and give the knowledge of salvation to His people in the forgiveness and remission of their sins. -- luke 1:77
.
Because of and through the heart of tender mercy and loving-kindness of our God, a Light from on high will dawn upon us and visit [us] -- luke 1:78
.
To shine upon and give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct and guide our feet in a straight line into the way of peace. -- luke 1:79
.
And the little boy grew and became strong in spirit; and he was in the deserts (wilderness) until the day of his appearing to Israel [the commencement of his public ministry]. -- luke 1:80
.
IN THOSE days it occurred that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole Roman empire should be registered. -- luke 2:1
.
This was the first enrollment, and it was made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. -- luke 2:2
.
And all the people were going to be registered, each to his own city or town. -- luke 2:3
.
And Joseph also went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea, to the town of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, -- luke 2:4
.
To be enrolled with Mary, his espoused (married) wife, who was about to become a mother. -- luke 2:5
.
And while they were there, the time came for her delivery, -- luke 2:6
.
And she gave birth to her Son, her Firstborn; and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room or place for them in the inn. -- luke 2:7
.
And in that vicinity there were shepherds living [out under the open sky] in the field, watching [in shifts] over their flock by night. -- luke 2:8
.
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord flashed and shone all about them, and they were terribly frightened. -- luke 2:9
.
But the angel said to them, Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people. -- luke 2:10
.
For to you is born this day in the town of David a Savior, Who is Christ (the Messiah) the Lord! -- luke 2:11
.
And this will be a sign for you [by which you will recognize Him]: you will find [after searching] a Baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. [I Sam. 2:34; II Kings 19:29; Isa. 7:14.] -- luke 2:12
.
Then suddenly there appeared with the angel an army of the troops of heaven (a heavenly knighthood), praising God and saying, -- luke 2:13
.
Glory to God in the highest [heaven], and on earth peace among men with whom He is well pleased [men of goodwill, of His favor]. -- luke 2:14
.
When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing (saying) that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us. -- luke 2:15
.
So they went with haste and [by searching] found Mary and Joseph, and the Baby lying in a manger. -- luke 2:16
.
And when they saw it, they made known what had been told them concerning this Child, -- luke 2:17
.
And all who heard it were astounded and marveled at what the shepherds told them. -- luke 2:18
.
But Mary was keeping within herself all these things (sayings), weighing and pondering them in her heart. -- luke 2:19
.
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, just as it had been told them. -- luke 2:20
.
And at the end of eight days, when [the Baby] was to be circumcised, He was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb. -- luke 2:21
.
And when the time for their purification [the mother's purification and the Baby's dedication] came according to the Law of Moses, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord-- -- luke 2:22
.
As it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every [firstborn] male that opens the womb shall be set apart and dedicated and called holy to the Lord-- -- luke 2:23
.
And [they came also] to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord: a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons. -- luke 2:24
.
Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout [cautiously and carefully observing the divine Law], and looking for the Consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him. -- luke 2:25
.
And it had been divinely revealed (communicated) to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- luke 2:26
.
And prompted by the [Holy] Spirit, he came into the temple [enclosure]; and when the parents brought in the little child Jesus to do for Him what was customary according to the Law, -- luke 2:27
.
[Simeon] took Him up in his arms and praised and thanked God and said, -- luke 2:28
.
And now, Lord, You are releasing Your servant to depart (leave this world) in peace, according to Your word. -- luke 2:29
.
For with my [own] eyes I have seen Your Salvation, -- luke 2:30
.
Which You have ordained and prepared before (in the presence of) all peoples, -- luke 2:31
.
A Light for revelation to the Gentiles [to disclose what was before unknown] and [to bring] praise and honor and glory to Your people Israel. -- luke 2:32
.
And His [legal] father and [His] mother were marveling at what was said about Him. -- luke 2:33
.
And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this Child is appointed and destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against-- -- luke 2:34
.
And a sword will pierce through your own soul also--that the secret thoughts and purposes of many hearts may be brought out and disclosed. -- luke 2:35
.
And there was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood, -- luke 2:36
.
And as a widow even for eighty-four years. She did not go out from the temple enclosure, but was worshiping night and day with fasting and prayer. -- luke 2:37
.
And she too came up at that same hour, and she returned thanks to God and talked of [Jesus] to all who were looking for the redemption (deliverance) of Jerusalem. -- luke 2:38
.
And when they had done everything according to the Law of the Lord, they went back into Galilee to their own town, Nazareth. -- luke 2:39
.
And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of God was upon Him. -- luke 2:40
.
Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year to the Passover Feast. -- luke 2:41
.
And when He was twelve years [old], they went up, as was their custom. -- luke 2:42
.
And when the Feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. Now His parents did not know this, -- luke 2:43
.
But, supposing Him to be in the caravan, they traveled on a day's journey; and [then] they sought Him [diligently, looking up and down for Him] among their kinsfolk and acquaintances. -- luke 2:44
.
And when they failed to find Him, they went back to Jerusalem, looking for Him [up and down] all the way. -- luke 2:45
.
After three days they found Him [came upon Him] in the [court of the] temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. -- luke 2:46
.
And all who heard Him were astonished and overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His intelligence and understanding and His replies. -- luke 2:47
.
And when they [Joseph and Mary] saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, Child, why have You treated us like this? Here Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You [distressed and tormented]. -- luke 2:48
.
And He said to them, How is it that you had to look for Me? Did you not see and know that it is necessary [as a duty] for Me to be in My Father's house and [occupied] about My Father's business? -- luke 2:49
.
But they did not comprehend what He was saying to them. -- luke 2:50
.
And He went down with them and came to Nazareth and was [habitually] obedient to them; and his mother kept and closely and persistently guarded all these things in her heart. -- luke 2:51
.
And Jesus increased in wisdom (in broad and full understanding) and in stature and years, and in favor with God and man. -- luke 2:52
.
IN THE fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign--when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene-- -- luke 3:1
.
In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] came to John son of Zachariah in the wilderness (desert). -- luke 3:2
.
And he went into all the country round about the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance (of hearty amending of their ways, with abhorrence of past wrongdoing) unto the forgiveness of sin. -- luke 3:3
.
As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness [shouting in the desert]: Prepare the way of the Lord, make His beaten paths straight. -- luke 3:4
.
Every valley and ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be leveled; and the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough roads shall be made smooth; -- luke 3:5
.
And all mankind shall see (behold and understand and at last acknowledge) the salvation of God (the deliverance from eternal death decreed by God). -- luke 3:6
.
So he said to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, You offspring of vipers! Who secretly warned you to flee from the coming wrath? -- luke 3:7
.
Bear fruits that are deserving and consistent with [your] repentance [that is, conduct worthy of a heart changed, a heart abhorring sin]. And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able from these stones to raise up descendants for Abraham. -- luke 3:8
.
Even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees, so that every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. -- luke 3:9
.
And the multitudes asked him, Then what shall we do? -- luke 3:10
.
And he replied to them, He who has two tunics (undergarments), let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do it the same way. -- luke 3:11
.
Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do? -- luke 3:12
.
And he said to them, Exact and collect no more than the fixed amount appointed you. -- luke 3:13
.
Those serving as soldiers also asked him, And we, what shall we do? And he replied to them, Never demand or enforce by terrifying people or by accusing wrongfully, and always be satisfied with your rations (supplies) and with your allowance (wages). -- luke 3:14
.
As the people were in suspense and waiting expectantly, and everybody reasoned and questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether he perhaps might be the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- luke 3:15
.
John answered them all by saying, I baptize you with water; but He Who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of Whose sandals I am not fit to unfasten. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. -- luke 3:16
.
His winnowing shovel (fork) is in His hand to thoroughly clear and cleanse His [threshing] floor and to gather the wheat and store it in His granary, but the chaff He will burn with fire that cannot be extinguished. -- luke 3:17
.
So with many other [various] appeals and admonitions he preached the good news (the Gospel) to the people. -- luke 3:18
.
But Herod the tetrarch, who had been [repeatedly] told about his fault and reproved with rebuke producing conviction by [John] for [having] Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the wicked things that Herod had done, -- luke 3:19
.
Added this to them all--that he shut up John in prison. -- luke 3:20
.
Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized, and [while He was still] praying, the [visible] heaven was opened -- luke 3:21
.
And the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came from heaven, saying, You are My Son, My Beloved! In You I am well pleased and find delight! -- luke 3:22
.
Jesus Himself, when He began [His ministry], was about thirty years of age, being the Son, as was supposed, of Joseph, the son of Heli, -- luke 3:23
.
The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, -- luke 3:24
.
The son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, -- luke 3:25
.
The son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, -- luke 3:26
.
The son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, -- luke 3:27
.
The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, -- luke 3:28
.
The son of Jesus, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, -- luke 3:29
.
The son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, -- luke 3:30
.
The son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, -- luke 3:31
.
The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon (Sala), the son of Nahshon, -- luke 3:32
.
The son of Aminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, -- luke 3:33
.
The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, -- luke 3:34
.
The son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, -- luke 3:35
.
The son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, -- luke 3:36
.
The son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, -- luke 3:37
.
The son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. -- luke 3:38
.
THEN JESUS, full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led in [by] the [Holy] Spirit -- luke 4:1
.
For (during) forty days in the wilderness (desert), where He was tempted (tried, tested exceedingly) by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they were completed, He was hungry. -- luke 4:2
.
Then the devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, order this stone to turn into a loaf [of bread]. -- luke 4:3
.
And Jesus replied to him, It is written, Man shall not live and be sustained by (on) bread alone but by every word and expression of God. -- luke 4:4
.
Then the devil took Him up to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the habitable world in a moment of time [in the twinkling of an eye]. -- luke 4:5
.
And he said to Him, To You I will give all this power and authority and their glory (all their magnificence, excellence, preeminence, dignity, and grace), for it has been turned over to me, and I give it to whomever I will. -- luke 4:6
.
Therefore if You will do homage to and worship me [just once], it shall all be Yours. -- luke 4:7
.
And Jesus replied to him, Get behind Me, Satan! It is written, You shall do homage to and worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve. -- luke 4:8
.
Then he took Him to Jerusalem and set Him on a gable of the temple, and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down from here; -- luke 4:9
.
For it is written, He will give His angels charge over you to guard and watch over you closely and carefully; -- luke 4:10
.
And on their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. -- luke 4:11
.
And Jesus replied to him, [The Scripture] says, You shall not tempt (try, test exceedingly) the Lord your God. -- luke 4:12
.
And when the devil had ended every [the complete cycle of] temptation, he [temporarily] left Him [that is, stood off from Him] until another more opportune and favorable time. -- luke 4:13
.
Then Jesus went back full of and under the power of the [Holy] Spirit into Galilee, and the fame of Him spread through the whole region round about. -- luke 4:14
.
And He Himself conducted [a course of] teaching in their synagogues, being recognized and honored and praised by all. -- luke 4:15
.
So He came to Nazareth, [that Nazareth] where He had been brought up, and He entered the synagogue, as was His custom on the Sabbath day. And He stood up to read. -- luke 4:16
.
And there was handed to Him [the roll of] the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened (unrolled) the book and found the place where it was written, -- luke 4:17
.
The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon Me, because He has anointed Me [the Anointed One, the Messiah] to preach the good news (the Gospel) to the poor; He has sent Me to announce release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to send forth as delivered those who are oppressed [who are downtrodden, bruised, crushed, and broken down by calamity], -- luke 4:18
.
To proclaim the accepted and acceptable year of the Lord [the day when salvation and the free favors of God profusely abound]. -- luke 4:19
.
Then He rolled up the book and gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing [attentively] at Him. -- luke 4:20
.
And He began to speak to them: Today this Scripture has been fulfilled while you are present and hearing. -- luke 4:21
.
And all spoke well of Him and marveled at the words of grace that came forth from His mouth; and they said, Is not this Joseph's Son? -- luke 4:22
.
So He said to them, You will doubtless quote to Me this proverb: Physician, heal Yourself! What we have learned by hearsay that You did in Capernaum, do here also in Your [own] town. -- luke 4:23
.
Then He said, Solemnly I say to you, no prophet is acceptable and welcome in his [own] town (country). -- luke 4:24
.
But in truth I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were closed up for three years and six months, so that there came a great famine over all the land; -- luke 4:25
.
And yet Elijah was not sent to a single one of them, but only to Zarephath in the country of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. [I Kings 17:1, 8-16; 18:1.] -- luke 4:26
.
And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and yet not one of them was cleansed [by being healed]--but only Naaman the Syrian. [II Kings 5:1-14.] -- luke 4:27
.
When they heard these things, all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage. -- luke 4:28
.
And rising up, they pushed and drove Him out of the town, and [laying hold of Him] they led Him to the [projecting] upper part of the hill on which their town was built, that they might hurl Him headlong down [over the cliff]. -- luke 4:29
.
But passing through their midst, He went on His way. -- luke 4:30
.
And He descended to Capernaum, a town of Galilee, and there He continued to teach the people on the Sabbath days. -- luke 4:31
.
And they were amazed at His teaching, for His word was with authority and ability and weight and power. -- luke 4:32
.
Now in the synagogue there was a man who was possessed by the foul spirit of a demon; and he cried out with a loud (deep, terrible) cry, -- luke 4:33
.
Ah, let us alone! What have You to do with us [What have we in common], Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know Who You are--the Holy One of God! -- luke 4:34
.
But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent (muzzled, gagged), and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown the man down in their midst, he came out of him without injuring him in any possible way. -- luke 4:35
.
And they were all amazed and said to one another, What kind of talk is this? For with authority and power He commands the foul spirits and they come out! -- luke 4:36
.
And a rumor about Him spread into every place in the surrounding country. -- luke 4:37
.
Then He arose and left the synagogue and went into Simon's (Peter's) house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering in the grip of a burning fever, and they pleaded with Him for her. -- luke 4:38
.
And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and immediately she got up and began waiting on them. -- luke 4:39
.
Now at the setting of the sun [indicating the end of the Sabbath], all those who had any [who were] sick with various diseases brought them to Him, and He laid His hands upon every one of them and cured them. -- luke 4:40
.
And demons even came out of many people, screaming and crying out, You are the Son of God! But He rebuked them and would not permit them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ (the Messiah). -- luke 4:41
.
And when daybreak came, He left [Peter's house] and went into an isolated [desert] place. And the people looked for Him until they came up to Him and tried to prevent Him from leaving them. -- luke 4:42
.
But He said to them, I must preach the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God to the other cities [and towns] also, for I was sent for this [purpose]. -- luke 4:43
.
And He continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee. -- luke 4:44
.
NOW IT occurred that while the people pressed upon Jesus to hear the message of God, He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret (Sea of Galilee). -- luke 5:1
.
And He saw two boats drawn up by the lake, but the fishermen had gone down from them and were washing their nets. -- luke 5:2
.
And getting into one of the boats, [the one] that belonged to Simon (Peter), He requested him to draw away a little from the shore. Then He sat down and continued to teach the crowd [of people] from the boat. -- luke 5:3
.
When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon (Peter), Put out into the deep [water], and lower your nets for a haul. -- luke 5:4
.
And Simon (Peter) answered, Master, we toiled all night [exhaustingly] and caught nothing [in our nets]. But on the ground of Your word, I will lower the nets [again]. -- luke 5:5
.
And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish; and as their nets were [at the point of] breaking, -- luke 5:6
.
They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and take hold with them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. -- luke 5:7
.
But when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord. -- luke 5:8
.
For he was gripped with bewildering amazement [allied to terror], and all who were with him, at the haul of fish which they had made; -- luke 5:9
.
And so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon (Peter). And Jesus said to Simon, Have no fear; from now on you will be catching men! -- luke 5:10
.
And after they had run their boats on shore, they left everything and joined Him as His disciples and sided with His party and accompanied Him. -- luke 5:11
.
While He was in one of the towns, there came a man full of (covered with) leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You are able to cure me and make me clean. -- luke 5:12
.
And [Jesus] reached out His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately the leprosy left him. -- luke 5:13
.
And [Jesus] charged him to tell no one [that he might chance to meet], until [He said] you go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your purification, as Moses commanded, for a testimony and proof to the people, that they may have evidence [of your healing]. -- luke 5:14
.
But so much the more the news spread abroad concerning Him, and great crowds kept coming together to hear [Him] and to be healed by Him of their infirmities. -- luke 5:15
.
But He Himself withdrew [in retirement] to the wilderness (desert) and prayed. -- luke 5:16
.
One of those days, as He was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by, who had come from every village and town of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was [present] with Him to heal them. -- luke 5:17
.
And behold, some men were bringing on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed, and they tried to carry him in and lay him before [Jesus]. -- luke 5:18
.
But finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him with his stretcher through the tiles into the midst, in front of Jesus. -- luke 5:19
.
And when He saw [their confidence in Him, springing from] their faith, He said, Man, your sins are forgiven you! -- luke 5:20
.
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason and question and argue, saying, Who is this [Man] Who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone? -- luke 5:21
.
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts and questionings, answered them, Why do you question in your hearts? -- luke 5:22
.
Which is easier: to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise and walk [about]? -- luke 5:23
.
But that you may know that the Son of Man has the [power of] authority and right on earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralyzed man, I say to you, arise, pick up your litter (stretcher), and go to your own house! -- luke 5:24
.
And instantly [the man] stood up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went away to his house, recognizing and praising and thanking God. -- luke 5:25
.
And overwhelming astonishment and ecstasy seized them all, and they recognized and praised and thanked God; and they were filled with and controlled by reverential fear and kept saying, We have seen wonderful and strange and incredible and unthinkable things today! -- luke 5:26
.
And after this, Jesus went out and looked [attentively] at a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office; and He said to him, Join Me as a disciple and side with My party and accompany Me. -- luke 5:27
.
And he forsook everything and got up and followed Him [becoming His disciple and siding with His party]. -- luke 5:28
.
And Levi (Matthew) made a great banquet for Him in his own house, and there was a large company of tax collectors and others who were reclining [at the table] with them. -- luke 5:29
.
Now the Pharisees and their scribes were grumbling against Jesus' disciples, saying, Why are you eating and drinking with tax collectors and [preeminently] sinful people? -- luke 5:30
.
And Jesus replied to them, It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. -- luke 5:31
.
I have not come to arouse and invite and call the righteous, but the erring ones (those not free from sin) to repentance [to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways, with abhorrence of their past sins]. -- luke 5:32
.
Then they said to Him, The disciples of John practice fasting often and offer up prayers of [special] petition, and so do [the disciples] of the Pharisees also, but Yours eat and drink. -- luke 5:33
.
And Jesus said to them, Can you make the wedding guests fast as long as the bridegroom is with them? -- luke 5:34
.
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; and then they will fast in those days. -- luke 5:35
.
He told them a proverb also: No one puts a patch from a new garment on an old garment; if he does, he will both tear the new one, and the patch from the new [one] will not match the old [garment]. -- luke 5:36
.
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the fresh wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled and the skins will be ruined (destroyed). -- luke 5:37
.
But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. -- luke 5:38
.
And no one after drinking old wine immediately desires new wine, for he says, The old is good or better. -- luke 5:39
.
ONE SABBATH while Jesus was passing through the fields of standing grain, it occurred that His disciples picked some of the spikes and ate [of the grain], rubbing it out in their hands. -- luke 6:1
.
But some of the Pharisees asked them, Why are you doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath days? -- luke 6:2
.
And Jesus replied to them, saying, Have you never so much as read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?--[I Sam. 21:1-6.] -- luke 6:3
.
How he went into the house of God and took and ate the [sacred] loaves of the showbread, which it is not permitted for any except only the priests to eat, and also gave to those [who were] with him? -- luke 6:4
.
And He said to them, The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath. -- luke 6:5
.
And it occurred on another Sabbath that when He went into the synagogue and taught, a man was present whose right hand was withered. -- luke 6:6
.
And the scribes and the Pharisees kept watching Jesus to see whether He would [actually] heal on the Sabbath, in order that they might get [some ground for] accusation against Him. -- luke 6:7
.
But He was aware all along of their thoughts, and He said to the man with the withered hand, Come and stand here in the midst. And he arose and stood there. -- luke 6:8
.
Then Jesus said to them, I ask you, is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good [so that someone derives advantage from it] or to do evil, to save a life [and make a soul safe] or to destroy it? -- luke 6:9
.
Then He glanced around at them all and said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he did so, and his hand was fully restored like the other one. -- luke 6:10
.
But they were filled with lack of understanding and senseless rage and discussed (consulted) with one another what they might do to Jesus. -- luke 6:11
.
Now in those days it occurred that He went up into a mountain to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God. -- luke 6:12
.
And when it was day, He summoned His disciples and selected from them twelve, whom He named apostles (special messengers): -- luke 6:13
.
They were Simon, whom He named Peter, and his brother Andrew; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew; -- luke 6:14
.
And Matthew and Thomas; and James son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, -- luke 6:15
.
And Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor (a treacherous, basely faithless person). -- luke 6:16
.
And Jesus came down with them and took His stand on a level spot, with a great crowd of His disciples and a vast throng of people from all over Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to listen to Him and to be cured of their diseases-- -- luke 6:17
.
Even those who were disturbed and troubled with unclean spirits, and they were being healed [also]. -- luke 6:18
.
And all the multitude were seeking to touch Him, for healing power was all the while going forth from Him and curing them all [saving them from severe illnesses or calamities]. -- luke 6:19
.
And solemnly lifting up His eyes on His disciples, He said: Blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from your outward condition--and to be envied) are you poor and lowly and afflicted (destitute of wealth, influence, position, and honor), for the kingdom of God is yours! -- luke 6:20
.
Blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from your outward condition--and to be envied) are you who hunger and seek with eager desire now, for you shall be filled and completely satisfied! Blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from your outward condition--and to be envied) are you who weep and sob now, for you shall laugh! -- luke 6:21
.
Blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from your outward condition--and to be envied) are you when people despise (hate) you, and when they exclude and excommunicate you [as disreputable] and revile and denounce you and defame and cast out and spurn your name as evil (wicked) on account of the Son of Man. -- luke 6:22
.
Rejoice and be glad at such a time and exult and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is rich and great and strong and intense and abundant in heaven; for even so their forefathers treated the prophets. -- luke 6:23
.
But woe to (alas for) you who are rich (abounding in material resources), for you already are receiving your consolation (the solace and sense of strengthening and cheer that come from prosperity) and have taken and enjoyed your comfort in full [having nothing left to be awarded you]. -- luke 6:24
.
Woe to (alas for) you who are full now (completely filled, luxuriously gorged and satiated), for you shall hunger and suffer want! Woe to (alas for) you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep and wail! -- luke 6:25
.
Woe to (alas for) you when everyone speaks fairly and handsomely of you and praises you, for even so their forefathers did to the false prophets. -- luke 6:26
.
But I say to you who are listening now to Me: [in order to heed, make it a practice to] love your enemies, treat well (do good to, act nobly toward) those who detest you and pursue you with hatred, -- luke 6:27
.
Invoke blessings upon and pray for the happiness of those who curse you, implore God's blessing (favor) upon those who abuse you [who revile, reproach, disparage, and high-handedly misuse you]. -- luke 6:28
.
To the one who strikes you on the jaw or cheek, offer the other jaw or cheek also; and from him who takes away your outer garment, do not withhold your undergarment as well. -- luke 6:29
.
Give away to everyone who begs of you [who is in want of necessities], and of him who takes away from you your goods, do not demand or require them back again. -- luke 6:30
.
And as you would like and desire that men would do to you, do exactly so to them. -- luke 6:31
.
If you [merely] love those who love you, what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? For even the [very] sinners love their lovers (those who love them). -- luke 6:32
.
And if you are kind and good and do favors to and benefit those who are kind and good and do favors to and benefit you, what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? For even the preeminently sinful do the same. -- luke 6:33
.
And if you lend money at interest to those from whom you hope to receive, what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? Even notorious sinners lend money at interest to sinners, so as to recover as much again. -- luke 6:34
.
But love your enemies and be kind and do good [doing favors so that someone derives benefit from them] and lend, expecting and hoping for nothing in return but considering nothing as lost and despairing of no one; and then your recompense (your reward) will be great (rich, strong, intense, and abundant), and you will be sons of the Most High, for He is kind and charitable and good to the ungrateful and the selfish and wicked. -- luke 6:35
.
So be merciful (sympathetic, tender, responsive, and compassionate) even as your Father is [all these]. -- luke 6:36
.
Judge not [neither pronouncing judgment nor subjecting to censure], and you will not be judged; do not condemn and pronounce guilty, and you will not be condemned and pronounced guilty; acquit and forgive and release (give up resentment, let it drop), and you will be acquitted and forgiven and released. -- luke 6:37
.
Give, and [gifts] will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will they pour into [the pouch formed by] the bosom [of your robe and used as a bag]. For with the measure you deal out [with the measure you use when you confer benefits on others], it will be measured back to you. -- luke 6:38
.
He further told them a proverb: Can a blind [man] guide and direct a blind [man]? Will they not both stumble into a ditch or a hole in the ground? -- luke 6:39
.
A pupil is not superior to his teacher, but everyone [when he is] completely trained (readjusted, restored, set to rights, and perfected) will be like his teacher. -- luke 6:40
.
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye but do not notice or consider the beam [of timber] that is in your own eye? -- luke 6:41
.
Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, allow me to take out the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? You actor (pretender, hypocrite)! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye. -- luke 6:42
.
For there is no good (healthy) tree that bears decayed (worthless, stale) fruit, nor on the other hand does a decayed (worthless, sickly) tree bear good fruit. -- luke 6:43
.
For each tree is known and identified by its own fruit; for figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor is a cluster of grapes picked from a bramblebush. -- luke 6:44
.
The upright (honorable, intrinsically good) man out of the good treasure [stored] in his heart produces what is upright (honorable and intrinsically good), and the evil man out of the evil storehouse brings forth that which is depraved (wicked and intrinsically evil); for out of the abundance (overflow) of the heart his mouth speaks. -- luke 6:45
.
Why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do not [practice] what I tell you? -- luke 6:46
.
For everyone who comes to Me and listens to My words [in order to heed their teaching] and does them, I will show you what he is like: -- luke 6:47
.
He is like a man building a house, who dug and went down deep and laid a foundation upon the rock; and when a flood arose, the torrent broke against that house and could not shake or move it, because it had been securely built or founded on a rock. -- luke 6:48
.
But he who merely hears and does not practice doing My words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation, against which the torrent burst, and immediately it collapsed and fell, and the breaking and ruin of that house was great. -- luke 6:49
.
AFTER JESUS had finished all that He had to say in the hearing of the people [on the mountain], He entered Capernaum. -- luke 7:1
.
Now a centurion had a bond servant who was held in honor and highly valued by him, who was sick and at the point of death. -- luke 7:2
.
And when the centurion heard of Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to Him, requesting Him to come and make his bond servant well. -- luke 7:3
.
And when they reached Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that You should do this for him, -- luke 7:4
.
For he loves our nation and he built us our synagogue [at his own expense]. -- luke 7:5
.
And Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent [some] friends to Him, saying, Lord, do not trouble [Yourself], for I am not sufficiently worthy to have You come under my roof; -- luke 7:6
.
Neither did I consider myself worthy to come to You. But [just] speak a word, and my servant boy will be healed. -- luke 7:7
.
For I also am a man [daily] subject to authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bond servant, Do this, and he does it. -- luke 7:8
.
Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled at him, and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him, I tell you, not even in [all] Israel have I found such great faith [as this]. -- luke 7:9
.
And when the messengers who had been sent returned to the house, they found the bond servant who had been ill quite well again. -- luke 7:10
.
Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and His disciples and a great throng accompanied Him. -- luke 7:11
.
[Just] as He drew near the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a large gathering from the town was accompanying her. -- luke 7:12
.
And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep. -- luke 7:13
.
And He went forward and touched the funeral bier, and the pallbearers stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, arise [from death]! -- luke 7:14
.
And the man [who was] dead sat up and began to speak. And [Jesus] gave him [back] to his mother. -- luke 7:15
.
Profound and reverent fear seized them all, and they began to recognize God and praise and give thanks, saying, A great Prophet has appeared among us! And God has visited His people [in order to help and care for and provide for them]! -- luke 7:16
.
And this report concerning [Jesus] spread through the whole of Judea and all the country round about. [I Kings 17:17-24; II Kings 4:32-37.] -- luke 7:17
.
And John's disciples brought him [who was now in prison] word of all these things. -- luke 7:18
.
And John summoned to him a certain two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord, saying, Are You He Who is to come, or shall we [continue to] look for another? -- luke 7:19
.
So the men came to Jesus and said, John the Baptist sent us to You to ask, Are You the One Who is to come, or shall we [continue to] look for another? -- luke 7:20
.
In that very hour Jesus was healing many [people] of sicknesses and distressing bodily plagues and evil spirits, and to many who were blind He gave [a free, gracious, joy-giving gift of] sight. -- luke 7:21
.
So He replied to them, Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the good news (the Gospel) preached to them. -- luke 7:22
.
And blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, apart from outward conditions--and to be envied) is he who takes no offense in Me and who is not hurt or resentful or annoyed or repelled or made to stumble [whatever may occur]. -- luke 7:23
.
And the messengers of John having departed, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the desert to gaze on? A reed shaken and swayed by the wind? -- luke 7:24
.
Then what did you go out to see? A man dressed up in soft garments? Behold, those who wear fine apparel and live in luxury are in the courts or palaces of kings. -- luke 7:25
.
What then did you go out to see? A prophet (a forthteller)? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. -- luke 7:26
.
This is the one of whom it is written, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall make ready Your way before You. -- luke 7:27
.
I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; but he that is inferior [to the other citizens] in the kingdom of God is greater [in incomparable privilege] than he. -- luke 7:28
.
And all the people who heard Him, even the tax collectors, acknowledged the justice of God [in calling them to repentance and in pronouncing future wrath on the impenitent], being baptized with the baptism of John. -- luke 7:29
.
But the Pharisees and the lawyers [of the Mosaic Law] annulled and rejected and brought to nothing God's purpose concerning themselves, by [refusing and] not being baptized by him [John]. -- luke 7:30
.
So to what shall I compare the men of this generation? And what are they like? -- luke 7:31
.
They are like little children sitting in the marketplace, calling to one another and saying, We piped to you [playing wedding], and you did not dance; we sang dirges and wailed [playing funeral], and you did not weep. -- luke 7:32
.
For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon. -- luke 7:33
.
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a Man Who is a glutton and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and notorious sinners. -- luke 7:34
.
Yet wisdom is vindicated (shown to be true and divine) by all her children [by their life, character, and deeds]. -- luke 7:35
.
One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him, and He went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at table. -- luke 7:36
.
And behold, a woman of the town who was an especially wicked sinner, when she learned that He was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment (perfume). -- luke 7:37
.
And standing behind Him at His feet weeping, she began to wet His feet with [her] tears; and she wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed His feet [affectionately] and anointed them with the ointment (perfume). -- luke 7:38
.
Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw it, he said to himself, If this Man were a prophet, He would surely know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him--for she is a notorious sinner (a social outcast, devoted to sin). -- luke 7:39
.
And Jesus, replying, said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he answered, Teacher, say it. -- luke 7:40
.
A certain lender of money [at interest] had two debtors: one owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. -- luke 7:41
.
When they had no means of paying, he freely forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more? -- luke 7:42
.
Simon answered, The one, I take it, for whom he forgave and cancelled more. And Jesus said to him, You have decided correctly. -- luke 7:43
.
Then turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? When I came into your house, you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. -- luke 7:44
.
You gave Me no kiss, but she from the moment I came in has not ceased [intermittently] to kiss My feet tenderly and caressingly. -- luke 7:45
.
You did not anoint My head with [cheap, ordinary] oil, but she has anointed My feet with [costly, rare] perfume. -- luke 7:46
.
Therefore I tell you, her sins, many [as they are], are forgiven her--because she has loved much. But he who is forgiven little loves little. -- luke 7:47
.
And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven! -- luke 7:48
.
Then those who were at table with Him began to say among themselves, Who is this Who even forgives sins? -- luke 7:49
.
But Jesus said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go (enter) into peace [in freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin]. -- luke 7:50
.
SOON AFTERWARD, [Jesus] went on through towns and villages, preaching and bringing the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve [apostles] were with Him, -- luke 8:1
.
And also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been expelled; -- luke 8:2
.
And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's household manager; and Susanna; and many others, who ministered to and provided for Him and them out of their property and personal belongings. -- luke 8:3
.
And when a very great throng was gathering together and people from town after town kept coming to Jesus, He said in a parable: -- luke 8:4
.
A sower went out to sow seed; and as he sowed, some fell along the traveled path and was trodden underfoot, and the birds of the air ate it up. -- luke 8:5
.
And some [seed] fell on the rock, and as soon as it sprouted, it withered away because it had no moisture. -- luke 8:6
.
And other [seed] fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it [off]. -- luke 8:7
.
And some seed fell into good soil, and grew up and yielded a crop a hundred times [as great]. As He said these things, He called out, He who has ears to hear, let him be listening and let him consider and understand by hearing! -- luke 8:8
.
And when His disciples asked Him the meaning of this parable, -- luke 8:9
.
He said to them, To you it has been given to [come progressively to] know (to recognize and understand more strongly and clearly) the mysteries and secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that, [though] looking, they may not see; and hearing, they may not comprehend. -- luke 8:10
.
Now the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God. -- luke 8:11
.
Those along the traveled road are the people who have heard; then the devil comes and carries away the message out of their hearts, that they may not believe (acknowledge Me as their Savior and devote themselves to Me) and be saved [here and hereafter]. -- luke 8:12
.
And those upon the rock [are the people] who, when they hear [the Word], receive and welcome it with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a while, and in time of trial and temptation fall away (withdraw and stand aloof). -- luke 8:13
.
And as for what fell among the thorns, these are [the people] who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked and suffocated with the anxieties and cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not ripen (come to maturity and perfection). -- luke 8:14
.
But as for that [seed] in the good soil, these are [the people] who, hearing the Word, hold it fast in a just (noble, virtuous) and worthy heart, and steadily bring forth fruit with patience. -- luke 8:15
.
No one after he has lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a [dining table] couch; but he puts it on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light. -- luke 8:16
.
For there is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come out into the open. -- luke 8:17
.
Be careful therefore how you listen. For to him who has [spiritual knowledge] will more be given; and from him who does not have [spiritual knowledge], even what he thinks and guesses and supposes that he has will be taken away. -- luke 8:18
.
Then Jesus' mother and His brothers came along toward Him, but they could not get to Him because of the crowd. -- luke 8:19
.
And it was told Him, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to have an interview with You. -- luke 8:20
.
But He answered them, My mother and My brothers are those who listen to the Word of God and do it! -- luke 8:21
.
One of those days He and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, Let us go across to the other side of the lake. So they put out to sea. -- luke 8:22
.
But as they were sailing, He fell off to sleep. And a whirlwind revolving from below upwards swept down on the lake, and the boat was filling with water, and they were in great danger. -- luke 8:23
.
And the disciples came and woke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! And He, being thoroughly awakened, censured and blamed and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there came a calm. -- luke 8:24
.
And He said to them, [Why are you so fearful?] Where is your faith (your trust, your confidence in Me--in My veracity and My integrity)? And they were seized with alarm and profound and reverent dread, and they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He commands even wind and sea, and they obey Him? -- luke 8:25
.
Then they came to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. -- luke 8:26
.
Now when Jesus stepped out on land, there met Him a certain man out of the town who had [was possessed by] demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but in the tombs. -- luke 8:27
.
And when he saw Jesus, he raised a deep (terrible) cry [from the depths of his throat] and fell down before Him [in terror] and shouted loudly, What have You [to do] with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? [What have we in common?] I beg You, do not torment me! -- luke 8:28
.
For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had snatched and held him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilderness (desert). -- luke 8:29
.
Jesus then asked him, What is your name? And he answered, Legion; for many demons had entered him. -- luke 8:30
.
And they begged [Jesus] not to command them to depart into the Abyss (bottomless pit). -- luke 8:31
.
Now a great herd of swine was there feeding on the hillside; and [the demons] begged Him to give them leave to enter these. And He allowed them [to do so]. -- luke 8:32
.
Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep cliff into the lake and were drowned. -- luke 8:33
.
When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and told it in the town and in the country. -- luke 8:34
.
And [people] went out to see what had occurred, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right (sound) mind; and they were seized with alarm and fear. -- luke 8:35
.
And those [also] who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was restored [to health]. -- luke 8:36
.
Then all the people of the country surrounding the Gerasenes' district asked [Jesus] to depart from them, for they were possessed and suffering with dread and terror; so He entered a boat and returned [to the west side of the Sea of Galilee]. -- luke 8:37
.
But the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging and praying that he might accompany Him and be with Him, but [Jesus] sent him away, saying, -- luke 8:38
.
Return to your home, and recount [the story] of how many and great things God has done for you. And [the man] departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him. -- luke 8:39
.
Now when Jesus came back [to Galilee], the crowd received and welcomed Him gladly, for they were all waiting and looking for Him. -- luke 8:40
.
And there came a man named Jairus, who had [for a long time] been a director of the synagogue; and falling at the feet of Jesus, he begged Him to come to his house, -- luke 8:41
.
For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. As [Jesus] went, the people pressed together around Him [almost suffocating Him]. -- luke 8:42
.
And a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years and had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed by anyone, -- luke 8:43
.
Came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment, and immediately her flow of blood ceased. -- luke 8:44
.
And Jesus said, Who is it who touched Me? When all were denying it, Peter and those who were with him said, Master, the multitudes surround You and press You on every side! -- luke 8:45
.
But Jesus said, Someone did touch Me; for I perceived that [healing] power has gone forth from Me. -- luke 8:46
.
And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came up trembling, and, falling down before Him, she declared in the presence of all the people for what reason she had touched Him and how she had been instantly cured. -- luke 8:47
.
And He said to her, Daughter, your faith (your confidence and trust in Me) has made you well! Go (enter) into peace (untroubled, undisturbed well-being). -- luke 8:48
.
While He was still speaking, a man from the house of the director of the synagogue came and said [to Jairus], Your daughter is dead; do not weary and trouble the Teacher any further. -- luke 8:49
.
But Jesus, on hearing this, answered him, Do not be seized with alarm or struck with fear; simply believe [in Me as able to do this], and she shall be made well. -- luke 8:50
.
And when He came to the house, He permitted no one to enter with Him except Peter and John and James, and the girl's father and mother. -- luke 8:51
.
And all were weeping for and bewailing her; but He said, Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping. -- luke 8:52
.
And they laughed Him to scorn, knowing full well that she was dead. -- luke 8:53
.
And grasping her hand, He called, saying, Child, arise [from the sleep of death]! -- luke 8:54
.
And her spirit returned [from death], and she arose immediately; and He directed that she should be given something to eat. -- luke 8:55
.
And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell no one what had occurred. -- luke 8:56
.
THEN JESUS called together the Twelve [apostles] and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases, -- luke 9:1
.
And He sent them out to announce and preach the kingdom of God and to bring healing. -- luke 9:2
.
And He said to them, Do not take anything for your journey--neither walking stick, nor wallet [for a collection bag], nor food of any kind, nor money, and do not have two undergarments (tunics). -- luke 9:3
.
And whatever house you enter, stay there until you go away [from that place]. -- luke 9:4
.
And wherever they do not receive and accept and welcome you, when you leave that town shake off [even] the dust from your feet, as a testimony against them. -- luke 9:5
.
And departing, they went about from village to village, preaching the Gospel and restoring the afflicted to health everywhere. -- luke 9:6
.
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was being done by [Jesus], and he was [thoroughly] perplexed and troubled, because it was said by some that John [the Baptist] had been raised from the dead, -- luke 9:7
.
And by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had come back to life. -- luke 9:8
.
But Herod said, John I beheaded; but Who is this about Whom I [learn] such things by hearsay? And he sought to see Him. -- luke 9:9
.
Upon their return, the apostles reported to Jesus all that they had done. And He took them [along with Him] and withdrew into privacy near a town called Bethsaida. -- luke 9:10
.
But when the crowds learned of it, [they] followed Him; and He welcomed them and talked to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed restoration to health. -- luke 9:11
.
Now the day began to decline, and the Twelve came and said to Him, Dismiss the crowds and send them away, so that they may go to the neighboring hamlets and villages and the surrounding country and find lodging and get a supply of provisions, for we are here in an uninhabited (barren, solitary) place. -- luke 9:12
.
But He said to them, You [yourselves] give them [food] to eat. They said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish--unless we are to go and buy food for all this crowd, [II Kings 4:42-44.] -- luke 9:13
.
For there were about 5,men. And [Jesus] said to His disciples, Have them [sit down] reclining in table groups (companies) of about fifty each. -- luke 9:14
.
And they did so, and made them all recline. -- luke 9:15
.
And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and [praising God] gave thanks and asked Him to bless them [to their use]. Then He broke them and gave them to the disciples to place before the multitude. -- luke 9:16
.
And all the people ate and were satisfied. And they gathered up what remained over--twelve [small hand] baskets of broken pieces. -- luke 9:17
.
Now it occurred that as Jesus was praying privately, the disciples were with Him, and He asked them, Who do men say that I am? -- luke 9:18
.
And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life. -- luke 9:19
.
And He said to them, But who do you [yourselves] say that I am? And Peter replied, The Christ of God! -- luke 9:20
.
But He strictly charged and sharply commanded them [under penalty] to tell this to no one [no one, whoever he might be], -- luke 9:21
.
Saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things and be [deliberately] disapproved and repudiated and rejected on the part of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death and on the third day be raised [again]. -- luke 9:22
.
And He said to all, If any person wills to come after Me, let him deny himself [disown himself, forget, lose sight of himself and his own interests, refuse and give up himself] and take up his cross daily and follow Me [cleave steadfastly to Me, conform wholly to My example in living and, if need be, in dying also]. -- luke 9:23
.
For whoever would preserve his life and save it will lose and destroy it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he will preserve and save it [from the penalty of eternal death]. -- luke 9:24
.
For what does it profit a man, if he gains the whole world and ruins or forfeits (loses) himself? -- luke 9:25
.
Because whoever is ashamed of Me and of My teachings, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the [threefold] glory (the splendor and majesty) of Himself and of the Father and of the holy angels. -- luke 9:26
.
However I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God. -- luke 9:27
.
Now about eight days after these teachings, Jesus took with Him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. -- luke 9:28
.
And as He was praying, the appearance of His countenance became altered (different), and His raiment became dazzling white [flashing with the brilliance of lightning]. -- luke 9:29
.
And behold, two men were conversing with Him--Moses and Elijah, -- luke 9:30
.
Who appeared in splendor and majesty and brightness and were speaking of His exit [from life], which He was about to bring to realization at Jerusalem. -- luke 9:31
.
Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, but when they fully awoke, they saw His glory (splendor and majesty and brightness) and the two men who stood with Him. -- luke 9:32
.
And it occurred as the men were parting from Him that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is delightful and good that we are here; and let us construct three booths or huts--one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah! not noticing or knowing what he was saying. -- luke 9:33
.
But even as he was saying this, a cloud came and began to overshadow them, and they were seized with alarm and struck with fear as they entered into the cloud. -- luke 9:34
.
Then there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, My Chosen One or My Beloved; listen to and yield to and obey Him! -- luke 9:35
.
And when the voice had died away, Jesus was found there alone. And they kept still, and told no one at that time any of these things that they had seen. -- luke 9:36
.
Now it occurred the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met Him. -- luke 9:37
.
And behold, a man from the crowd shouted out, Master, I implore You to look at my son, for he is my only child; -- luke 9:38
.
And behold, a spirit seizes him and suddenly he cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth; and he is sorely shattered, and it will scarcely leave him. -- luke 9:39
.
And I implored Your disciples to drive it out, but they could not. -- luke 9:40
.
Jesus answered, O [faithless ones] unbelieving and without trust in God, a perverse (wayward, crooked and warped) generation! Until when and how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here [to Me]. -- luke 9:41
.
And even while he was coming, the demon threw him down and [completely] convulsed him. But Jesus censured and severely rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and restored him to his father. -- luke 9:42
.
And all were astounded at the evidence of God's mighty power and His majesty and magnificence. But [while] they were all marveling at everything Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples, -- luke 9:43
.
Let these words sink into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men [whose conduct is opposed to God]. -- luke 9:44
.
However, they did not comprehend this saying; and it was kept hidden from them, so that they should not grasp it and understand, and they were afraid to ask Him about the statement. -- luke 9:45
.
But a controversy arose among them as to which of them might be the greatest [surpassing the others in excellence, worth, and authority]. -- luke 9:46
.
But Jesus, as He perceived the thoughts of their hearts, took a little child and put him at His side -- luke 9:47
.
And told them, Whoever receives and accepts and welcomes this child in My name and for My sake receives and accepts and welcomes Me; and whoever so receives Me so also receives Him Who sent Me. For he who is least and lowliest among you all--he is [the one who is truly] great. -- luke 9:48
.
John said, Master, we saw a man driving out demons in Your name and we commanded him to stop it, for he does not follow along with us. -- luke 9:49
.
But Jesus told him, Do not forbid [such people]; for whoever is not against you is for you. -- luke 9:50
.
Now when the time was almost come for Jesus to be received up [to heaven], He steadfastly and determinedly set His face to go to Jerusalem. -- luke 9:51
.
And He sent messengers before Him; and they reached and entered a Samaritan village to make [things] ready for Him; -- luke 9:52
.
But [the people] would not welcome or receive or accept Him, because His face was [set as if He was] going to Jerusalem. -- luke 9:53
.
And when His disciples James and John observed this, they said, Lord, do You wish us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did ? [II Kings 1:9-16.] -- luke 9:54
.
But He turned and rebuked and severely censured them. He said, You do not know of what sort of spirit you are, -- luke 9:55
.
For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them [from the penalty of eternal death]. And they journeyed on to another village. -- luke 9:56
.
And it occurred that as they were going along the road, a man said to Him, Lord, I will follow You wherever You go. -- luke 9:57
.
And Jesus told him, Foxes have lurking holes and the birds of the air have roosts and nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head. -- luke 9:58
.
And He said to another, Become My disciple, side with My party, and accompany Me! But he replied, Lord, permit me first to go and bury (await the death of) my father. -- luke 9:59
.
But Jesus said to him, Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and publish abroad throughout all regions the kingdom of God. -- luke 9:60
.
Another also said, I will follow You, Lord, and become Your disciple and side with Your party; but let me first say good-bye to those at my home. -- luke 9:61
.
Jesus said to him, No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back [to the things behind] is fit for the kingdom of God. -- luke 9:62
.
NOW AFTER this the Lord chose and appointed seventy others and sent them out ahead of Him, two by two, into every town and place where He Himself was about to come (visit). -- luke 10:1
.
And He said to them, The harvest indeed is abundant [there is much ripe grain], but the farmhands are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest. -- luke 10:2
.
Go your way; behold, I send you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. -- luke 10:3
.
Carry no purse, no provisions bag, no [change of] sandals; refrain from [retarding your journey by] saluting and wishing anyone well along the way. -- luke 10:4
.
Whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this household! [Freedom from all the distresses that result from sin be with this family]. -- luke 10:5
.
And if anyone [worthy] of peace and blessedness is there, the peace and blessedness you wish shall come upon him; but if not, it shall come back to you. -- luke 10:6
.
And stay on in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house. -- luke 10:7
.
Whenever you go into a town and they receive and accept and welcome you, eat what is set before you; -- luke 10:8
.
And heal the sick in it and say to them, The kingdom of God has come close to you. -- luke 10:9
.
But whenever you go into a town and they do not receive and accept and welcome you, go out into its streets and say, -- luke 10:10
.
Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we are wiping off against you; yet know and understand this: the kingdom of God has come near you. -- luke 10:11
.
I tell you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that town. -- luke 10:12
.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. -- luke 10:13
.
However, it shall be more tolerable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. -- luke 10:14
.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted unto heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades (the regions of the dead). -- luke 10:15
.
He who hears and heeds you [disciples] hears and heeds Me; and he who slights and rejects you slights and rejects Me; and he who slights and rejects Me slights and rejects Him who sent Me. -- luke 10:16
.
The seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name! -- luke 10:17
.
And He said to them, I saw Satan falling like a lightning [flash] from heaven. -- luke 10:18
.
Behold! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and [physical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy [possesses]; and nothing shall in any way harm you. -- luke 10:19
.
Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven. -- luke 10:20
.
In that same hour He rejoiced and gloried in the Holy Spirit and said, I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have concealed these things [relating to salvation] from the wise and understanding and learned, and revealed them to babes (the childish, unskilled, and untaught). Yes, Father, for such was Your gracious will and choice and good pleasure. -- luke 10:21
.
All things have been given over into My power by My Father; and no one knows Who the Son is except the Father, or Who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son may choose to reveal and make Him known. -- luke 10:22
.
Then turning to His disciples, He said privately, Blessed (happy, to be envied) are those whose eyes see what you see! -- luke 10:23
.
For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see and they did not see it, and to hear what you hear and they did not hear it. -- luke 10:24
.
And then a certain lawyer arose to try (test, tempt) Him, saying, Teacher, what am I to do to inherit everlasting life [that is, to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]? -- luke 10:25
.
Jesus said to him, What is written in the Law? How do you read it? -- luke 10:26
.
And he replied, You must love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself. -- luke 10:27
.
And Jesus said to him, You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live [enjoy active, blessed, endless life in the kingdom of God]. -- luke 10:28
.
And he, determined to acquit himself of reproach, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor? -- luke 10:29
.
Jesus, taking him up, replied, A certain man was going from Jerusalem down to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothes and belongings and beat him and went their way, [unconcernedly] leaving him half dead, as it happened. -- luke 10:30
.
Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down along that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. -- luke 10:31
.
A Levite likewise came down to the place and saw him, and passed by on the other side [of the road]. -- luke 10:32
.
But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled along, came down to where he was; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity and sympathy [for him], -- luke 10:33
.
And went to him and dressed his wounds, pouring on [them] oil and wine. Then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him. -- luke 10:34
.
And the next day he took out two denarii [two day's wages] and gave [them] to the innkeeper, saying, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I [myself] will repay you when I return. -- luke 10:35
.
Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers? -- luke 10:36
.
He answered, The one who showed pity and mercy to him. And Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise. -- luke 10:37
.
Now while they were on their way, it occurred that Jesus entered a certain village, and a woman named Martha received and welcomed Him into her house. -- luke 10:38
.
And she had a sister named Mary, who seated herself at the Lord's feet and was listening to His teaching. -- luke 10:39
.
But Martha [overly occupied and too busy] was distracted with much serving; and she came up to Him and said, Lord, is it nothing to You that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me [to lend a hand and do her part along with me]! -- luke 10:40
.
But the Lord replied to her by saying, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; -- luke 10:41
.
There is need of only one or but a few things. Mary has chosen the good portion [that which is to her advantage], which shall not be taken away from her. -- luke 10:42
.
THEN HE was praying in a certain place; and when He stopped, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, [just] as John taught his disciples. -- luke 11:1
.
And He said to them, When you pray, say: Our Father Who is in heaven, hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. Your will be done [held holy and revered] on earth as it is in heaven. -- luke 11:2
.
Give us daily our bread [food for the morrow]. -- luke 11:3
.
And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us [who has offended us or done us wrong]. And bring us not into temptation but rescue us from evil. -- luke 11:4
.
And He said to them, Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and will say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves [of bread], -- luke 11:5
.
For a friend of mine who is on a journey has just come, and I have nothing to put before him; -- luke 11:6
.
And he from within will answer, Do not disturb me; the door is now closed, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and supply you [with anything]? -- luke 11:7
.
I tell you, although he will not get up and supply him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his shameless persistence and insistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs. -- luke 11:8
.
So I say to you, Ask and keep on asking and it shall be given you; seek and keep on seeking and you shall find; knock and keep on knocking and the door shall be opened to you. -- luke 11:9
.
For everyone who asks and keeps on asking receives; and he who seeks and keeps on seeking finds; and to him who knocks and keeps on knocking, the door shall be opened. -- luke 11:10
.
What father among you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone; or if he asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent? -- luke 11:11
.
Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? -- luke 11:12
.
If you then, evil as you are, know how to give good gifts [gifts that are to their advantage] to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and continue to ask Him! -- luke 11:13
.
Now Jesus was driving out a demon that was dumb; and it occurred that when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled. -- luke 11:14
.
But some of them said, He drives out demons [because He is in league with and] by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, -- luke 11:15
.
While others, to try and test and tempt Him, demanded a sign of Him from heaven. -- luke 11:16
.
But He, [well] aware of their intent and purpose, said to them, Every kingdom split up against itself is doomed and brought to desolation, and so house falls upon house. [The disunited household will collapse.] -- luke 11:17
.
And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom last? For you say that I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub. -- luke 11:18
.
Now if I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub, with whose help and by whom do your sons drive them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. -- luke 11:19
.
But if I drive out the demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has [already] come upon you. -- luke 11:20
.
When the strong man, fully armed, [from his courtyard] guards his own dwelling, his belongings are undisturbed [his property is at peace and is secure]. -- luke 11:21
.
But when one stronger than he attacks him and conquers him, he robs him of his whole armor on which he had relied and divides up and distributes all his goods as plunder (spoil). -- luke 11:22
.
He who is not with Me [siding and believing with Me] is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me [engage in My interest], scatters. -- luke 11:23
.
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it roams through waterless places in search [of a place] of rest (release, refreshment, ease); and finding none it says, I will go back to my house from which I came. -- luke 11:24
.
And when it arrives, it finds [the place] swept and put in order and furnished and decorated. -- luke 11:25
.
And it goes and brings other spirits, seven [of them], more evil than itself, and they enter in, settle down, and dwell there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. -- luke 11:26
.
Now it occurred that as He was saying these things, a certain woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, Blessed (happy and to be envied) is the womb that bore You and the breasts that You sucked! -- luke 11:27
.
But He said, Blessed (happy and to be envied) rather are those who hear the Word of God and obey and practice it! -- luke 11:28
.
Now as the crowds were [increasingly] thronging Him, He began to say, This present generation is a wicked one; it seeks and demands a sign (miracle), but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah [the prophet]. -- luke 11:29
.
For [just] as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will also the Son of Man be [a sign] to this age and generation. -- luke 11:30
.
The queen of the South will arise in the judgment with the people of this age and generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the [inhabited] earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon, and notice, here is more than Solomon. [I Kings 10:1-13; II Chron. 9:1-12.] -- luke 11:31
.
The men of Nineveh will appear as witnesses at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, here is more than Jonah. -- luke 11:32
.
No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or crypt or under a bushel measure, but on a lampstand, that those who are coming in may see the light. -- luke 11:33
.
Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye (your conscience) is sound and fulfilling its office, your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound and is not fulfilling its office, your body is full of darkness. -- luke 11:34
.
Be careful, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness. -- luke 11:35
.
If then your entire body is illuminated, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright [with light], as when a lamp with its bright rays gives you light. -- luke 11:36
.
Now while Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee invited Him to take dinner with him, so He entered and reclined at table. -- luke 11:37
.
The Pharisee noticed and was astonished [to see] that Jesus did not first wash before dinner. -- luke 11:38
.
But the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside you yourselves are full of greed and robbery and extortion and malice and wickedness. -- luke 11:39
.
You senseless (foolish, stupid) ones [acting without reflection or intelligence]! Did not He Who made the outside make the inside also? -- luke 11:40
.
But [dedicate your inner self and] give as donations to the poor of those things which are within [of inward righteousness] and behold, everything is purified and clean for you. -- luke 11:41
.
But woe to you, Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every [little] herb, but disregard and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone. -- luke 11:42
.
Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and [you love] to be greeted and bowed down to in the [public] marketplaces. -- luke 11:43
.
Woe to you! For you are like graves which are not marked or seen, and men walk over them without being aware of it [and are ceremonially defiled]. -- luke 11:44
.
One of the experts in the [Mosaic] Law answered Him, Teacher, in saying this, You reproach and outrage and affront even us! -- luke 11:45
.
But He said, Woe to you, the lawyers, also! For you load men with oppressive burdens hard to bear, and you do not personally [even gently] touch the burdens with one of your fingers. -- luke 11:46
.
Woe to you! For you are rebuilding and repairing the tombs of the prophets, whom your fathers killed (destroyed). -- luke 11:47
.
So you bear witness and give your full approval and consent to the deeds of your fathers; for they actually killed them, and you rebuild and repair monuments to them. -- luke 11:48
.
For this reason also the wisdom of God said, I will send them prophets and apostles, [some] of whom they will put to death and persecute, -- luke 11:49
.
So that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be charged against and required of this age and generation, -- luke 11:50
.
From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against and required of this age and generation. -- luke 11:51
.
Woe to you, lawyers (experts in the Mosaic Law)! For you have taken away the key to knowledge; you did not go in yourselves, and you hindered and prevented those who were entering. -- luke 11:52
.
As He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees [followed Him closely, and they] began to be enraged with and set themselves violently against Him and to draw Him out and provoke Him to speak of many things, -- luke 11:53
.
Secretly watching and plotting and lying in wait for Him, to seize upon something He might say [that they might accuse Him]. -- luke 11:54
.
IN THE meanwhile, when so many thousands of the people had gathered that they were trampling on one another, Jesus commenced by saying primarily to His disciples, Be on your guard against the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy [producing unrest and violent agitation]. -- luke 12:1
.
Nothing is [so closely] covered up that it will not be revealed, or hidden that it will not be known. -- luke 12:2
.
Whatever you have spoken in the darkness shall be heard and listened to in the light, and what you have whispered in [people's] ears and behind closed doors will be proclaimed upon the housetops. -- luke 12:3
.
I tell you, My friends, do not dread and be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do. -- luke 12:4
.
But I will warn you whom you should fear: fear Him Who, after killing, has power to hurl into hell (Gehenna); yes, I say to you, fear Him! -- luke 12:5
.
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And [yet] not one of them is forgotten or uncared for in the presence of God. -- luke 12:6
.
But [even] the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be struck with fear or seized with alarm; you are of greater worth than many [flocks] of sparrows. -- luke 12:7
.
And I tell you, Whoever declares openly [speaking out freely] and confesses that he is My worshiper and acknowledges Me before men, the Son of Man also will declare and confess and acknowledge him before the angels of God. -- luke 12:8
.
But he who disowns and denies and rejects and refuses to acknowledge Me before men will be disowned and denied and rejected and refused acknowledgement in the presence of the angels of God. -- luke 12:9
.
And everyone who makes a statement or speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit [that is, whoever intentionally comes short of the reverence due the Holy Spirit], it will not be forgiven him [for him there is no forgiveness]. -- luke 12:10
.
And when they bring you before the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities, do not be anxious [beforehand] how you shall reply in defense or what you are to say. -- luke 12:11
.
For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour and moment what [you] ought to say. -- luke 12:12
.
Someone from the crowd said to Him, Master, order my brother to divide the inheritance and share it with me. -- luke 12:13
.
But He told him, Man, who has appointed Me a judge or umpire and divider over you? -- luke 12:14
.
And He said to them, Guard yourselves and keep free from all covetousness (the immoderate desire for wealth, the greedy longing to have more); for a man's life does not consist in and is not derived from possessing overflowing abundance or that which is over and above his needs. -- luke 12:15
.
Then He told them a parable, saying, The land of a rich man was fertile and yielded plentifully. -- luke 12:16
.
And he considered and debated within himself, What shall I do? I have no place [in which] to gather together my harvest. -- luke 12:17
.
And he said, I will do this: I will pull down my storehouses and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain or produce and my goods. -- luke 12:18
.
And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many good things laid up, [enough] for many years. Take your ease; eat, drink, and enjoy yourself merrily. -- luke 12:19
.
But God said to him, You fool! This very night they [the messengers of God] will demand your soul of you; and all the things that you have prepared, whose will they be? -- luke 12:20
.
So it is with the one who continues to lay up and hoard possessions for himself and is not rich [in his relation] to God [this is how he fares]. -- luke 12:21
.
And [Jesus] said to His disciples, Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious and troubled [with cares] about your life, as to what you will [have to] eat; or about your body, as to what you will [have to] wear. -- luke 12:22
.
For life is more than food, and the body [more] than clothes. -- luke 12:23
.
Observe and consider the ravens; for they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn; and [yet] God feeds them. Of how much more worth are you than the birds! -- luke 12:24
.
And which of you by being overly anxious and troubled with cares can add a cubit to his stature or a moment [unit] of time to his age [the length of his life]? -- luke 12:25
.
If then you are not able to do such a little thing as that, why are you anxious and troubled with cares about the rest? -- luke 12:26
.
Consider the lilies, how they grow. They neither [wearily] toil nor spin nor weave; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory (his splendor and magnificence) was not arrayed like one of these. [I Kings 10:4-7.] -- luke 12:27
.
But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today, and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, O you [people] of little faith? -- luke 12:28
.
And you, do not seek [by meditating and reasoning to inquire into] what you are to eat and what you are to drink; nor be of anxious (troubled) mind [unsettled, excited, worried, and in suspense]; -- luke 12:29
.
For all the pagan world is [greedily] seeking these things, and your Father knows that you need them. -- luke 12:30
.
Only aim at and strive for and seek His kingdom, and all these things shall be supplied to you also. -- luke 12:31
.
Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom! -- luke 12:32
.
Sell what you possess and give donations to the poor; provide yourselves with purses and handbags that do not grow old, an unfailing and inexhaustible treasure in the heavens, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. -- luke 12:33
.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. -- luke 12:34
.
Keep your loins girded and your lamps burning, -- luke 12:35
.
And be like men who are waiting for their master to return home from the marriage feast, so that when he returns from the wedding and comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately. -- luke 12:36
.
Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are those servants whom the master finds awake and alert and watching when he comes. Truly I say to you, he will gird himself and have them recline at table and will come and serve them! -- luke 12:37
.
If he comes in the second watch (before midnight) or the third watch (after midnight), and finds them so, blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are those servants! -- luke 12:38
.
But of this be assured: if the householder had known at what time the burglar was coming, he would have been awake and alert and watching and would not have permitted his house to be dug through and broken into. -- luke 12:39
.
You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour and a moment when you do not anticipate it. -- luke 12:40
.
Peter said, Lord, are You telling this parable for us, or for all alike? -- luke 12:41
.
And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful steward, the wise man whom his master will set over those in his household service to supply them their allowance of food at the appointed time? -- luke 12:42
.
Blessed (happy and to be envied) is that servant whom his master finds so doing when he arrives. -- luke 12:43
.
Truly I tell you, he will set him in charge over all his possessions. -- luke 12:44
.
But if that servant says in his heart, My master is late in coming, and begins to strike the menservants and the maids and to eat and drink and get drunk, -- luke 12:45
.
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he does not know, and will punish him and cut him off and assign his lot with the unfaithful. -- luke 12:46
.
And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act as he would wish him to act shall be beaten with many [lashes]. -- luke 12:47
.
But he who did not know and did things worthy of a beating shall be beaten with few [lashes]. For everyone to whom much is given, of him shall much be required; and of him to whom men entrust much, they will require and demand all the more. -- luke 12:48
.
I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled! -- luke 12:49
.
I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and how greatly and sorely I am urged on (impelled, constrained) until it is accomplished! -- luke 12:50
.
Do you suppose that I have come to give peace upon earth? No, I say to you, but rather division; -- luke 12:51
.
For from now on in one house there will be five divided [among themselves], three against two and two against three. -- luke 12:52
.
They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. -- luke 12:53
.
He also said to the crowds of people, When you see a cloud rising in the west, at once you say, It is going to rain! And so it does. -- luke 12:54
.
And when [you see that] a south wind is blowing, you say, There will be severe heat! And it occurs. -- luke 12:55
.
You playactors (hypocrites)! You know how [intelligently] to discern and interpret and prove the looks of the earth and sky; but how is it that you do not know how to discern and interpret and apply the proof to this present time? -- luke 12:56
.
And why do you not judge what is just and personally decide what is right? -- luke 12:57
.
Then as you go with your accuser before a magistrate, on the way make a diligent effort to settle and be quit (free) of him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison. -- luke 12:58
.
I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the very last [fraction of a] cent. -- luke 12:59
.
JUST AT that time there [arrived] some people who informed Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. -- luke 13:1
.
And He replied by saying to them, Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans because they have suffered in this way? -- luke 13:2
.
I tell you, No; but unless you repent (change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways, with abhorrence of your past sins), you will all likewise perish and be lost eternally. -- luke 13:3
.
Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them--do you think that they were more guilty offenders (debtors) than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem? -- luke 13:4
.
I tell you, No; but unless you repent (change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways, with abhorrence of your past sins), you will all likewise perish and be lost eternally. -- luke 13:5
.
And He told them this parable: A certain man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it, but did not find [any]. -- luke 13:6
.
So he said to the vinedresser, See here! For these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and I find none. Cut it down! Why should it continue also to use up the ground [to deplete the soil, intercept the sun, and take up room]? -- luke 13:7
.
But he replied to him, Leave it alone, sir, [just] this one more year, till I dig around it and put manure [on the soil]. -- luke 13:8
.
Then perhaps it will bear fruit after this; but if not, you can cut it down and out. -- luke 13:9
.
Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. -- luke 13:10
.
And there was a woman there who for eighteen years had had an infirmity caused by a spirit (a demon of sickness). She was bent completely forward and utterly unable to straighten herself up or to look upward. -- luke 13:11
.
And when Jesus saw her, He called [her to Him] and said to her, Woman, you are released from your infirmity! -- luke 13:12
.
Then He laid [His] hands on her, and instantly she was made straight, and she recognized and thanked and praised God. -- luke 13:13
.
But the leader of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, There are six days on which work ought to be done; so come on those days and be cured, and not on the Sabbath day. -- luke 13:14
.
But the Lord replied to him, saying, You playactors (hypocrites)! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it out to water it? -- luke 13:15
.
And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day? -- luke 13:16
.
Even as He said this, all His opponents were put to shame, and all the people were rejoicing over all the glorious things that were being done by Him. -- luke 13:17
.
This led Him to say, What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? -- luke 13:18
.
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his own garden; and it grew and became a tree, and the wild birds found shelter and roosted and nested in its branches. -- luke 13:19
.
And again He said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God? -- luke 13:20
.
It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of wheat flour or meal until it was all leavened (fermented). -- luke 13:21
.
[Jesus] journeyed on through towns and villages, teaching, and making His way toward Jerusalem. -- luke 13:22
.
And someone asked Him, Lord, will only a few be saved (rescued, delivered from the penalties of the last judgment, and made partakers of the salvation by Christ)? And He said to them, -- luke 13:23
.
Strive to enter by the narrow door [force yourselves through it], for many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able. -- luke 13:24
.
When once the Master of the house gets up and closes the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door [again and again], saying, Lord, open to us! He will answer you, I do not know where [what household--certainly not Mine] you come from. -- luke 13:25
.
Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets. -- luke 13:26
.
But He will say, I tell you, I do not know where [what household--certainly not Mine] you come from; depart from Me, all you wrongdoers! -- luke 13:27
.
There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves being cast forth (banished, driven away). -- luke 13:28
.
And [people] will come from east and west, and from north and south, and sit down (feast at table) in the kingdom of God. -- luke 13:29
.
And behold, there are some [now] last who will be first [then], and there are some [now] first who will be last [then]. -- luke 13:30
.
At that very hour some Pharisees came up and said to Him, Go away from here, for Herod is determined to kill You. -- luke 13:31
.
And He said to them, Go and tell that fox [sly and crafty, skulking and cowardly], Behold, I drive out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I finish (complete) My course. -- luke 13:32
.
Nevertheless, I must continue on My way today and tomorrow and the day after that--for it will never do for a prophet to be destroyed away from Jerusalem! -- luke 13:33
.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who continue to kill the prophets and to stone those who are sent to you! How often I have desired and yearned to gather your children together [around Me], as a hen [gathers] her young under her wings, but you would not! -- luke 13:34
.
Behold, your house is forsaken (abandoned, left to you destitute of God's help)! And I tell you, you will not see Me again until the time comes when you shall say, Blessed (to be celebrated with praises) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord! -- luke 13:35
.
IT OCCURRED one Sabbath, when [Jesus] went for a meal at the house of one of the ruling Pharisees, that they were [engaged in] watching Him [closely]. -- luke 14:1
.
And behold, [just] in front of Him there was a man who had dropsy. -- luke 14:2
.
And Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees, Is it lawful and right to cure on the Sabbath or not? -- luke 14:3
.
But they kept silent. Then He took hold [of the man] and cured him and sent him away. -- luke 14:4
.
And He said to them, Which of you, having a son or a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a well, will not at once pull him out on the Sabbath day? -- luke 14:5
.
And they were unable to reply to this. -- luke 14:6
.
Now He told a parable to those who were invited, [when] He noticed how they were selecting the places of honor, saying to them, -- luke 14:7
.
When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, do not recline on the chief seat [in the place of honor], lest a more distinguished person than you has been invited by him, -- luke 14:8
.
And he who invited both of you will come to you and say, Let this man have the place [you have taken]. Then, with humiliation and a guilty sense of impropriety, you will begin to take the lowest place. -- luke 14:9
.
But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when your host comes in, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher! Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit [at table] with you. -- luke 14:10
.
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled (ranked below others who are honored or rewarded), and he who humbles himself (keeps a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly) will be exalted (elevated in rank). -- luke 14:11
.
Jesus also said to the man who had invited Him, When you give a dinner or a supper, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors, lest perhaps they also invite you in return, and so you are paid back. -- luke 14:12
.
But when you give a banquet or a reception, invite the poor, the disabled, the lame, and the blind. -- luke 14:13
.
Then you will be blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied), because they have no way of repaying you, and you will be recompensed at the resurrection of the just (upright). -- luke 14:14
.
When one of those who reclined [at the table] with Him heard this, he said to Him, Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God! -- luke 14:15
.
But Jesus said to him, A man was once giving a great supper and invited many; -- luke 14:16
.
And at the hour for the supper he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all is now ready. -- luke 14:17
.
But they all alike began to make excuses and to beg off. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and I have to go out and see it; I beg you, have me excused. -- luke 14:18
.
And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to examine and put my approval on them; I beg you, have me excused. -- luke 14:19
.
And another said, I have married a wife, and because of this I am unable to come. -- luke 14:20
.
So the servant came and reported these [answers] to his master. Then the master of the house said in wrath to his servant, Go quickly into the great streets and the small streets of the city and bring in here the poor and the disabled and the blind and the lame. -- luke 14:21
.
And the servant [returning] said, Sir, what you have commanded me to do has been done, and yet there is room. -- luke 14:22
.
Then the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges and urge and constrain [them] to yield and come in, so that my house may be filled. -- luke 14:23
.
For I tell you, not one of those who were invited shall taste my supper. -- luke 14:24
.
Now huge crowds were going along with [Jesus], and He turned and said to them, -- luke 14:25
.
If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his [own] father and mother [in the sense of indifference to or relative disregard for them in comparison with his attitude toward God] and [likewise] his wife and children and brothers and sisters--[yes] and even his own life also--he cannot be My disciple. -- luke 14:26
.
Whoever does not persevere and carry his own cross and come after (follow) Me cannot be My disciple. -- luke 14:27
.
For which of you, wishing to build a farm building, does not first sit down and calculate the cost [to see] whether he has sufficient means to finish it? -- luke 14:28
.
Otherwise, when he has laid the foundation and is unable to complete [the building], all who see it will begin to mock and jeer at him, -- luke 14:29
.
Saying, This man began to build and was not able (worth enough) to finish. -- luke 14:30
.
Or what king, going out to engage in conflict with another king, will not first sit down and consider and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand [men] to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? -- luke 14:31
.
And if he cannot [do so], when the other king is still a great way off, he sends an envoy and asks the terms of peace. -- luke 14:32
.
So then, any of you who does not forsake (renounce, surrender claim to, give up, say good-bye to) all that he has cannot be My disciple. -- luke 14:33
.
Salt is good [an excellent thing], but if salt has lost its strength and has become saltless (insipid, flat), how shall its saltness be restored? -- luke 14:34
.
It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap; men throw it away. He who has ears to hear, let him listen and consider and comprehend by hearing! -- luke 14:35
.
NOW THE tax collectors and [notorious and especially wicked] sinners were all coming near to [Jesus] to listen to Him. -- luke 15:1
.
And the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering and indignantly complaining, saying, This man accepts and receives and welcomes [preeminently wicked] sinners and eats with them. -- luke 15:2
.
So He told them this parable: -- luke 15:3
.
What man of you, if he has a hundred sheep and should lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness (desert) and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? -- luke 15:4
.
And when he has found it, he lays it on his [own] shoulders, rejoicing. -- luke 15:5
.
And when he gets home, he summons together [his] friends and [his] neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep which was lost. -- luke 15:6
.
Thus, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one [especially] wicked person who repents (changes his mind, abhorring his errors and misdeeds, and determines to enter upon a better course of life) than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance. -- luke 15:7
.
Or what woman, having ten [silver] drachmas [each one equal to a day's wages], if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and look carefully and diligently until she finds it? -- luke 15:8
.
And when she has found it, she summons her [women] friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the silver coin which I had lost. -- luke 15:9
.
Even so, I tell you, there is joy among and in the presence of the angels of God over one [especially] wicked person who repents (changes his mind for the better, heartily amending his ways, with abhorrence of his past sins). -- luke 15:10
.
And He said, There was a certain man who had two sons; -- luke 15:11
.
And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the part of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided the estate between them. -- luke 15:12
.
And not many days after that, the younger son gathered up all that he had and journeyed into a distant country, and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and loose [from restraint] living. -- luke 15:13
.
And when he had spent all he had, a mighty famine came upon that country, and he began to fall behind and be in want. -- luke 15:14
.
So he went and forced (glued) himself upon one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed hogs. -- luke 15:15
.
And he would gladly have fed on and filled his belly with the carob pods that the hogs were eating, but [they could not satisfy his hunger and] nobody gave him anything [better]. -- luke 15:16
.
Then when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have enough food, and [even food] to spare, but I am perishing (dying) here of hunger! -- luke 15:17
.
I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. -- luke 15:18
.
I am no longer worthy to be called your son; [just] make me like one of your hired servants. -- luke 15:19
.
So he got up and came to his [own] father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with pity and tenderness [for him]; and he ran and embraced him and kissed him [fervently]. -- luke 15:20
.
And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son [I no longer deserve to be recognized as a son of yours]! -- luke 15:21
.
But the father said to his bond servants, Bring quickly the best robe (the festive robe of honor) and put it on him; and give him a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet. -- luke 15:22
.
And bring out that [wheat-]fattened calf and kill it; and let us revel and feast and be happy and make merry, -- luke 15:23
.
Because this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found! And they began to revel and feast and make merry. -- luke 15:24
.
But his older son was in the field; and as he returned and came near the house, he heard music and dancing. -- luke 15:25
.
And having called one of the servant [boys] to him, he began to ask what this meant. -- luke 15:26
.
And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed that [wheat-]fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and well. -- luke 15:27
.
But [the elder brother] was angry [with deep-seated wrath] and resolved not to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him, -- luke 15:28
.
But he answered his father, Look! These many years I have served you, and I have never disobeyed your command. Yet you never gave me [so much as] a [little] kid, that I might revel and feast and be happy and make merry with my friends; -- luke 15:29
.
But when this son of yours arrived, who has devoured your estate with immoral women, you have killed for him that [wheat-] fattened calf! -- luke 15:30
.
And the father said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. -- luke 15:31
.
But it was fitting to make merry, to revel and feast and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found! -- luke 15:32
.
ALSO [Jesus] said to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a manager of his estate, and accusations [against this man] were brought to him, that he was squandering his [master's] possessions. -- luke 16:1
.
And he called him and said to him, What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management [of my affairs], for you can be [my] manager no longer. -- luke 16:2
.
And the manager of the estate said to himself, What shall I do, seeing that my master is taking the management away from me? I am not able to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. -- luke 16:3
.
I have come to know what I will do, so that they [my master's debtors] may accept and welcome me into their houses when I am put out of the management. -- luke 16:4
.
So he summoned his master's debtors one by one, and he said to the first, How much do you owe my master? -- luke 16:5
.
He said, A hundred measures [about gallons] of oil. And he said to him, Take back your written acknowledgement of obligation, and sit down quickly and write fifty [about 450 gallons]. -- luke 16:6
.
After that he said to another, And how much do you owe? He said, A hundred measures [about bushels] of wheat. He said to him, Take back your written acknowledgement of obligation, and write eighty [about 700 bushels]. -- luke 16:7
.
And [his] master praised the dishonest (unjust) manager for acting shrewdly and prudently; for the sons of this age are shrewder and more prudent and wiser in [relation to] their own generation [to their own age and kind] than are the sons of light. -- luke 16:8
.
And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon (deceitful riches, money, possessions), so that when it fails, they [those you have favored] may receive and welcome you into the everlasting habitations (dwellings). -- luke 16:9
.
He who is faithful in a very little [thing] is faithful also in much, and he who is dishonest and unjust in a very little [thing] is dishonest and unjust also in much. -- luke 16:10
.
Therefore if you have not been faithful in the [case of] unrighteous mammon (deceitful riches, money, possessions), who will entrust to you the true riches? -- luke 16:11
.
And if you have not proved faithful in that which belongs to another [whether God or man], who will give you that which is your own [that is, the true riches]? -- luke 16:12
.
No servant is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon (riches, or anything in which you trust and on which you rely). -- luke 16:13
.
Now the Pharisees, who were covetous and lovers of money, heard all these things [taken together], and they began to sneer at and ridicule and scoff at Him. -- luke 16:14
.
But He said to them, You are the ones who declare yourselves just and upright before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted and highly thought of among men is detestable and abhorrent (an abomination) in the sight of God. [I Sam. 16:7; Prov. 21:2.] -- luke 16:15
.
Until John came, there were the Law and the Prophets; since then the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone strives violently to go in [would force his own way rather than God's way into it]. -- luke 16:16
.
Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to fail and become void. -- luke 16:17
.
Whoever divorces (dismisses and repudiates) his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery. -- luke 16:18
.
There was a certain rich man who [habitually] clothed himself in purple and fine linen and reveled and feasted and made merry in splendor every day. -- luke 16:19
.
And at his gate there was [carelessly] dropped down and left a certain utterly destitute man named Lazarus, [reduced to begging alms and] covered with [ulcerated] sores. -- luke 16:20
.
He [eagerly] desired to be satisfied with what fell from the rich man's table; moreover, the dogs even came and licked his sores. -- luke 16:21
.
And it occurred that the man [reduced to] begging died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. -- luke 16:22
.
And in Hades (the realm of the dead), being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom. -- luke 16:23
.
And he cried out and said, Father Abraham, have pity and mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame. -- luke 16:24
.
But Abraham said, Child, remember that you in your lifetime fully received [what is due you in] comforts and delights, and Lazarus in like manner the discomforts and distresses; but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish. -- luke 16:25
.
And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who want to pass from this [place] to you may not be able, and no one may pass from there to us. -- luke 16:26
.
And [the man] said, Then, father, I beseech you to send him to my father's house-- -- luke 16:27
.
For I have five brothers--so that he may give [solemn] testimony and warn them, lest they too come into this place of torment. -- luke 16:28
.
But Abraham said, They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear and listen to them. -- luke 16:29
.
But he answered, No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent (change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways, with abhorrence of their past sins). -- luke 16:30
.
He said to him, If they do not hear and listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded and convinced and believe [even] if someone should rise from the dead. -- luke 16:31
.
AND [Jesus] said to His disciples, Temptations (snares, traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come, but woe to him by or through whom they come! -- luke 17:1
.
It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare to one of these little ones [lowly in rank or influence]. -- luke 17:2
.
Pay attention and always be on your guard [looking out for one another]. If your brother sins (misses the mark), solemnly tell him so and reprove him, and if he repents (feels sorry for having sinned), forgive him. -- luke 17:3
.
And even if he sins against you seven times in a day, and turns to you seven times and says, I repent [I am sorry], you must forgive him (give up resentment and consider the offense as recalled and annulled). -- luke 17:4
.
The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith (that trust and confidence that spring from our belief in God). -- luke 17:5
.
And the Lord answered, If you had faith (trust and confidence in God) even [so small] like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, Be pulled up by the roots, and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you. -- luke 17:6
.
Will any man of you who has a servant plowing or tending sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, Come at once and take your place at the table? -- luke 17:7
.
Will he not instead tell him, Get my supper ready and gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; then afterward you yourself shall eat and drink? -- luke 17:8
.
Is he grateful and does he praise the servant because he did what he was ordered to do? -- luke 17:9
.
Even so on your part, when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you, say, We are unworthy servants [possessing no merit, for we have not gone beyond our obligation]; we have [merely] done what was our duty to do. -- luke 17:10
.
As He went on His way to Jerusalem, it occurred that [Jesus] was passing [along the border] between Samaria and Galilee. -- luke 17:11
.
And as He was going into one village, He was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance. -- luke 17:12
.
And they raised up their voices and called, Jesus, Master, take pity and have mercy on us! -- luke 17:13
.
And when He saw them, He said to them, Go [at once] and show yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were cured and made clean. -- luke 17:14
.
Then one of them, upon seeing that he was cured, turned back, recognizing and thanking and praising God with a loud voice; -- luke 17:15
.
And he fell prostrate at Jesus' feet, thanking Him [over and over]. And he was a Samaritan. -- luke 17:16
.
Then Jesus asked, Were not [all] ten cleansed? Where are the nine? -- luke 17:17
.
Was there no one found to return and to recognize and give thanks and praise to God except this alien? -- luke 17:18
.
And He said to him, Get up and go on your way. Your faith (your trust and confidence that spring from your belief in God) has restored you to health. -- luke 17:19
.
Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He replied to them by saying, The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be observed or with visible display, -- luke 17:20
.
Nor will people say, Look! Here [it is]! or, See, [it is] there! For behold, the kingdom of God is within you [in your hearts] and among you [surrounding you]. -- luke 17:21
.
And He said to the disciples, The time is coming when you will long to see [even] one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see [it]. -- luke 17:22
.
And they will say to you, Look! [He is] there! or, Look! [He is] here! But do not go out or follow [them]. -- luke 17:23
.
For like the lightning, that flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so will the Son of Man be in His [own] day. -- luke 17:24
.
But first He must suffer many things and be disapproved and repudiated and rejected by this age and generation. -- luke 17:25
.
And [just] as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the time of the Son of Man. -- luke 17:26
.
[People] ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, right up to the day when Noah went into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. -- luke 17:27
.
So also [it was the same] as it was in the days of Lot. [People] ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; -- luke 17:28
.
But on the [very] day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed [them] all. -- luke 17:29
.
That is the way it will be on the day that the Son of Man is revealed. -- luke 17:30
.
On that day let him who is on the housetop, with his belongings in the house, not come down [and go inside] to carry them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back. -- luke 17:31
.
Remember Lot's wife! -- luke 17:32
.
Whoever tries to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve and quicken it. -- luke 17:33
.
I tell you, in that night there will be two men in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left. -- luke 17:34
.
There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other will be left. -- luke 17:35
.
Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left. -- luke 17:36
.
Then they asked Him, Where, Lord? He said to them, Wherever the dead body is, there will the vultures or eagles be gathered together. -- luke 17:37
.
ALSO [Jesus] told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not to turn coward (faint, lose heart, and give up). -- luke 18:1
.
He said, In a certain city there was a judge who neither reverenced and feared God nor respected or considered man. -- luke 18:2
.
And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, Protect and defend and give me justice against my adversary. -- luke 18:3
.
And for a time he would not; but later he said to himself, Though I have neither reverence or fear for God nor respect or consideration for man, -- luke 18:4
.
Yet because this widow continues to bother me, I will defend and protect and avenge her, lest she give me intolerable annoyance and wear me out by her continual coming or at the last she come and rail on me or assault me or strangle me. -- luke 18:5
.
Then the Lord said, Listen to what the unjust judge says! -- luke 18:6
.
And will not [our just] God defend and protect and avenge His elect (His chosen ones), who cry to Him day and night? Will He defer them and delay help on their behalf? -- luke 18:7
.
I tell you, He will defend and protect and avenge them speedily. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find [persistence in] faith on the earth? -- luke 18:8
.
He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves and were confident that they were righteous [that they were upright and in right standing with God] and scorned and made nothing of all the rest of men: -- luke 18:9
.
Two men went up into the temple [enclosure] to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. -- luke 18:10
.
The Pharisee took his stand ostentatiously and began to pray thus before and with himself: God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men--extortioners (robbers), swindlers [unrighteous in heart and life], adulterers--or even like this tax collector here. -- luke 18:11
.
I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I gain. -- luke 18:12
.
But the tax collector, [merely] standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but kept striking his breast, saying, O God, be favorable (be gracious, be merciful) to me, the especially wicked sinner that I am! -- luke 18:13
.
I tell you, this man went down to his home justified (forgiven and made upright and in right standing with God), rather than the other man; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted. -- luke 18:14
.
Now they were also bringing [even] babies to Him that He might touch them, and when the disciples noticed it, they reproved them. -- luke 18:15
.
But Jesus called them [the parents] to Him, saying, Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for to such [as these] belongs the kingdom of God. -- luke 18:16
.
Truly I say to you, whoever does not accept and receive and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [does] shall not in any way enter it [at all]. -- luke 18:17
.
And a certain ruler asked Him, Good Teacher [You who are essentially and perfectly morally good], what shall I do to inherit eternal life [to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]? -- luke 18:18
.
Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me [essentially and perfectly morally] good? No one is [essentially and perfectly morally] good--except God only. -- luke 18:19
.
You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not witness falsely, honor your father and your mother. -- luke 18:20
.
And he replied, All these I have kept from my youth. -- luke 18:21
.
And when Jesus heard it, He said to him, One thing you still lack. Sell everything that you have and divide [the money] among the poor, and you will have [rich] treasure in heaven; and come back [and] follow Me [become My disciple, join My party, and accompany Me]. -- luke 18:22
.
But when he heard this, he became distressed and very sorrowful, for he was rich--exceedingly so. -- luke 18:23
.
Jesus, observing him, said, How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! -- luke 18:24
.
For it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle's eye than [for] a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. -- luke 18:25
.
And those who heard it said, Then who can be saved? -- luke 18:26
.
But He said, What is impossible with men is possible with God. -- luke 18:27
.
And Peter said, See, we have left our own [things--home, family, and business] and have followed You. -- luke 18:28
.
And He said to them, I say to you truly, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God -- luke 18:29
.
Who will not receive in return many times more in this world and, in the coming age, eternal life. -- luke 18:30
.
Then taking the Twelve [apostles] aside, He said to them, Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written about the Son of Man through and by the prophets will be fulfilled. -- luke 18:31
.
For He will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be made sport of and scoffed and jeered at and insulted and spit upon. -- luke 18:32
.
They will flog Him and kill Him; and on the third day He will rise again. -- luke 18:33
.
But they understood nothing of these things; His words were a mystery and hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what He was telling them. -- luke 18:34
.
As He came near to Jericho, it occurred that a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. -- luke 18:35
.
And hearing a crowd going by, he asked what it meant. -- luke 18:36
.
They told him, Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. -- luke 18:37
.
And he shouted, saying, Jesus, Son of David, take pity and have mercy on me! -- luke 18:38
.
But those who were in front reproved him, telling him to keep quiet; yet he screamed and shrieked so much the more, Son of David, take pity and have mercy on me! -- luke 18:39
.
Then Jesus stood still and ordered that he be led to Him; and when he came near, Jesus asked him, -- luke 18:40
.
What do you want Me to do for you? He said, Lord, let me receive my sight! -- luke 18:41
.
And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight! Your faith (your trust and confidence that spring from your faith in God) has healed you. -- luke 18:42
.
And instantly he received his sight and began to follow Jesus, recognizing, praising, and honoring God; and all the people, when they saw it, praised God. -- luke 18:43
.
AND [Jesus] entered Jericho and was passing through it. -- luke 19:1
.
And there was a man called Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector, and [he was] rich. -- luke 19:2
.
And he was trying to see Jesus, which One He was, but he could not on account of the crowd, because he was small in stature. -- luke 19:3
.
So he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass that way. -- luke 19:4
.
And when Jesus reached the place, He looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today. -- luke 19:5
.
So he hurried and came down, and he received and welcomed Him joyfully. -- luke 19:6
.
And when the people saw it, they all muttered among themselves and indignantly complained, He has gone in to be the guest of and lodge with a man who is devoted to sin and preeminently a sinner. -- luke 19:7
.
So then Zacchaeus stood up and solemnly declared to the Lord, See, Lord, the half of my goods I [now] give [by way of restoration] to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone out of anything, I [now] restore four times as much. -- luke 19:8
.
And Jesus said to him, Today is [Messianic and spiritual] salvation come to [all the members of] this household, since Zacchaeus too is a [real spiritual] son of Abraham; -- luke 19:9
.
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost. -- luke 19:10
.
Now as they were listening to these things, He proceeded to tell a parable, because He was approaching Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to be brought to light and shown forth immediately. -- luke 19:11
.
He therefore said, A certain nobleman went into a distant country to obtain for himself a kingdom and then to return. -- luke 19:12
.
Calling ten of his [own] bond servants, he gave them ten minas [each equal to about one hundred days' wages or nearly twenty dollars] and said to them, Buy and sell with these while I go and then return. -- luke 19:13
.
But his citizens detested him and sent an embassy after him to say, We do not want this man to become ruler over us. -- luke 19:14
.
When he returned after having received the kingdom, he ordered these bond servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know how much each one had made by buying and selling. -- luke 19:15
.
The first one came before him, and he said, Lord, your mina has made ten [additional] minas. -- luke 19:16
.
And he said to him, Well done, excellent bond servant! Because you have been faithful and trustworthy in a very little [thing], you shall have authority over ten cities. -- luke 19:17
.
The second one also came and said, Lord, your mina has made five more minas. -- luke 19:18
.
And he said also to him, And you will take charge over five cities. -- luke 19:19
.
Then another came and said, Lord, here is your mina, which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief. -- luke 19:20
.
For I was [constantly] afraid of you, because you are a stern (hard, severe) man; you pick up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow. -- luke 19:21
.
He said to the servant, I will judge and condemn you out of your own mouth, you wicked slave! You knew [did you] that I was a stern (hard, severe) man, picking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow? -- luke 19:22
.
Then why did you not put my money in a bank, so that on my return, I might have collected it with interest? -- luke 19:23
.
And he said to the bystanders, Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas. -- luke 19:24
.
And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas [already]! -- luke 19:25
.
And [said Jesus,] I tell you that to everyone who gets and has will more be given, but from the man who does not get and does not have, even what he has will be taken away. -- luke 19:26
.
[The indignant king ended by saying] But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them--bring them here and slaughter them in my presence! -- luke 19:27
.
And after saying these things, Jesus went on ahead of them, going up to Jerusalem. -- luke 19:28
.
When He came near Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called [the Mount of] Olives, He sent two of His disciples, -- luke 19:29
.
Telling [them], Go into the village yonder; there, as you go in, you will find a donkey's colt tied, on which no man has ever yet sat. Loose it and bring [it here]. -- luke 19:30
.
If anybody asks you, Why are you untying [it]? you shall say this: Because the Lord has need of it. -- luke 19:31
.
So those who were sent went away and found it [just] as He had told them. -- luke 19:32
.
And as they were loosening the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt? -- luke 19:33
.
And they said, The Lord has need of it. -- luke 19:34
.
And they brought it to Jesus; then they threw their garments over the colt and set Jesus upon it. -- luke 19:35
.
And as He rode along, the people kept spreading their garments on the road. [II Kings 9:13.] -- luke 19:36
.
As He was approaching [the city], at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God [extolling Him exultantly and] loudly for all the mighty miracles and works of power that they had witnessed, -- luke 19:37
.
Crying, Blessed (celebrated with praises) is the King Who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven [freedom there from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin] and glory (majesty and splendor) in the highest [heaven]! -- luke 19:38
.
And some of the Pharisees from the throng said to Jesus, Teacher, reprove Your disciples! -- luke 19:39
.
He replied, I tell you that if these keep silent, the very stones will cry out. -- luke 19:40
.
And as He approached, He saw the city, and He wept [audibly] over it, -- luke 19:41
.
Exclaiming, Would that you had known personally, even at least in this your day, the things that make for peace (for freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin and upon which your peace--your security, safety, prosperity, and happiness--depends)! But now they are hidden from your eyes. -- luke 19:42
.
For a time is coming upon you when your enemies will throw up a bank [with pointed stakes] about you and surround you and shut you in on every side. -- luke 19:43
.
And they will dash you down to the ground, you [Jerusalem] and your children within you; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, [all] because you did not come progressively to recognize and know and understand [from observation and experience] the time of your visitation [that is, when God was visiting you, the time in which God showed Himself gracious toward you and offered you salvation through Christ]. -- luke 19:44
.
Then He went into the temple [enclosure] and began to drive out those who were selling, -- luke 19:45
.
Telling them, It is written, My house shall be a house of prayer; but you have made it a cave of robbers. -- luke 19:46
.
And He continued to teach day after day in the temple [porches and courts]. The chief priests and scribes and the leading men of the people were seeking to put Him to death, -- luke 19:47
.
But they did not discover anything they could do, for all the people hung upon His words and stuck by Him. -- luke 19:48
.
ONE DAY as Jesus was instructing the people in the temple [porches] and preaching the good news (the Gospel), the chief priests and the scribes came up with the elders (members of the Sanhedrin) -- luke 20:1
.
And said to Him, Tell us by what [sort of] authority You are doing these things? Or who is it who gave You this authority? -- luke 20:2
.
He replied to them, I will also ask you a question. Now answer Me: -- luke 20:3
.
Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? -- luke 20:4
.
And they argued and discussed [it] and reasoned together with themselves, saying, If we reply, From heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him? -- luke 20:5
.
But if we answer, From men, all the people will stone us to death, for they are long since firmly convinced that John was a prophet. -- luke 20:6
.
So they replied that they did not know from where it came. -- luke 20:7
.
Then Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. -- luke 20:8
.
Then He began to relate to the people this parable (this story to figuratively portray what He had to say): A man planted a vineyard and leased it to some vinedressers and went into another country for a long stay. -- luke 20:9
.
When the [right] season came, he sent a bond servant to the tenants, that they might give him [his part] of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat (thrashed) him and sent him away empty-handed. -- luke 20:10
.
And he sent still another servant; him they also beat (thrashed) and dishonored and insulted him disgracefully and sent him away empty-handed. -- luke 20:11
.
And he sent yet a third; this one they wounded and threw out [of the vineyard]. -- luke 20:12
.
Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it is probable that they will respect him. -- luke 20:13
.
But when the tenants saw him, they argued among themselves, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours. -- luke 20:14
.
So they drove him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? -- luke 20:15
.
He will come and [utterly] put an end to those tenants and will give the vineyard to others. When they [the chief priests and the scribes and the elders] heard this, they said, May it never be! -- luke 20:16
.
But [Jesus] looked at them and said, What then is [the meaning of] this that is written: The [very] Stone which the builders rejected has become the chief Stone of the corner [Cornerstone]? -- luke 20:17
.
Everyone who falls on that Stone will be broken [in pieces]; but upon whomever It falls, It will crush him [winnow him and scatter him as dust]. -- luke 20:18
.
The scribes and the chief priests desired and tried to find a way to arrest Him at that very hour, but they were afraid of the people; for they discerned that He had related this parable against them. -- luke 20:19
.
So they watched [for an opportunity to ensnare] Him, and sent spies who pretended to be upright (honest and sincere), that they might lay hold of something He might say, so as to turn Him over to the control and authority of the governor. -- luke 20:20
.
They asked Him, Teacher, we know that You speak and teach what is right, and that You show no partiality to anyone but teach the way of God honestly and in truth. -- luke 20:21
.
Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not? -- luke 20:22
.
But He recognized and understood their cunning and unscrupulousness and said to them, -- luke 20:23
.
Show Me a denarius (a coin)! Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered, Caesar's. -- luke 20:24
.
He said to them, Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. -- luke 20:25
.
So they could not in the presence of the people take hold of anything He said to turn it against Him; but marveling at His reply, they were silent. -- luke 20:26
.
Also there came to Him some Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection. -- luke 20:27
.
And they asked Him a question, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote for us [a law] that if a man's brother dies, leaving a wife and no children, the man shall take the woman and raise up offspring for his brother. -- luke 20:28
.
Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died without [having any] children. -- luke 20:29
.
And the second -- luke 20:30
.
And then the third took her, and in like manner all seven, and they died, leaving no children. -- luke 20:31
.
Last of all, the woman died also. -- luke 20:32
.
Now in the resurrection whose wife will the woman be? For the seven married her. -- luke 20:33
.
And Jesus said to them, The people of this world and present age marry and are given in marriage; -- luke 20:34
.
But those who are considered worthy to gain that other world and that future age and to attain to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage; -- luke 20:35
.
For they cannot die again, but they are angel-like and equal to angels. And being sons of and sharers in the resurrection, they are sons of God. -- luke 20:36
.
But that the dead are raised [from death]--even Moses made known and showed in the passage concerning the [burning] bush, where he calls the Lord, The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. -- luke 20:37
.
Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all men are alive [whether in the body or out of it] and they are alive [not dead] unto Him [in definite relationship to Him]. -- luke 20:38
.
And some of the scribes replied, Teacher, you have spoken well and expertly [so that there is no room for blame]. -- luke 20:39
.
For they did not dare to question Him further. -- luke 20:40
.
But He asked them, How can people say that the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) is David's Son? -- luke 20:41
.
For David himself says in [the] Book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand -- luke 20:42
.
Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet. -- luke 20:43
.
So David calls Him Lord; how then is He his Son? -- luke 20:44
.
And with all the people listening, He said to His disciples, -- luke 20:45
.
Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes and love to be saluted [with honor] in places where people congregate and love the front and best seats in the synagogues and places of distinction at feasts, -- luke 20:46
.
Who make away with and devour widows' houses, and [to cover it up] with pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation (the heavier sentence, the severer punishment). -- luke 20:47
.
LOOKING UP, [Jesus] saw the rich people putting their gifts into the treasury. -- luke 21:1
.
And He saw also a poor widow putting in two mites (copper coins). -- luke 21:2
.
And He said, Truly I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them; -- luke 21:3
.
For they all gave out of their abundance (their surplus); but she has contributed out of her lack and her want, putting in all that she had on which to live. -- luke 21:4
.
And as some were saying of the temple that it was decorated with handsome (shapely and magnificent) stones and consecrated offerings [laid up to be kept], He said, -- luke 21:5
.
As for all this that you [thoughtfully] look at, the time will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down. -- luke 21:6
.
And they asked Him, Teacher, when will this happen? And what sign will there be when this is about to occur? -- luke 21:7
.
And He said, Be on your guard and be careful that you are not led astray; for many will come in My name [appropriating to themselves the name Messiah which belongs to Me], saying, I am He! and, The time is at hand! Do not go out after them. -- luke 21:8
.
And when you hear of wars and insurrections (disturbances, disorder, and confusion), do not become alarmed and panic-stricken and terrified; for all this must take place first, but the end will not [come] immediately. -- luke 21:9
.
Then He told them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. [II Chron. 15:6; Isa. 19:2.] -- luke 21:10
.
There will be mighty and violent earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences (plagues: malignant and contagious or infectious epidemic diseases which are deadly and devastating); and there will be sights of terror and great signs from heaven. -- luke 21:11
.
But previous to all this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, turning you over to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be led away before kings and governors for My name's sake. -- luke 21:12
.
This will be a time (an opportunity) for you to bear testimony. -- luke 21:13
.
Resolve and settle it in your minds not to meditate and prepare beforehand how you are to make your defense and how you will answer. -- luke 21:14
.
For I [Myself] will give you a mouth and such utterance and wisdom that all of your foes combined will be unable to stand against or refute. -- luke 21:15
.
You will be delivered up and betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and [some] of you they will put to death. -- luke 21:16
.
And you will be hated (despised) by everyone because [you bear] My name and for its sake. -- luke 21:17
.
But not a hair of your head shall perish. [I Sam. 14:45.] -- luke 21:18
.
By your steadfastness and patient endurance you shall win the true life of your souls. -- luke 21:19
.
But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know and understand that its desolation has come near. -- luke 21:20
.
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside [the city] get out of it, and let not those who are out in the country come into it; -- luke 21:21
.
For those are days of vengeance [of rendering full justice or satisfaction], that all things that are written may be fulfilled. -- luke 21:22
.
Alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have babies which they are nursing in those days! For great misery and anguish and distress shall be upon the land and indignation and punishment and retribution upon this people. -- luke 21:23
.
They will fall by the mouth and the edge of the sword and will be led away as captives to and among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (completed). -- luke 21:24
.
And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth [there will be] distress (trouble and anguish) of nations in bewilderment and perplexity [without resources, left wanting, embarrassed, in doubt, not knowing which way to turn] at the roaring (the echo) of the tossing of the sea, -- luke 21:25
.
Men swooning away or expiring with fear and dread and apprehension and expectation of the things that are coming on the world; for the [very] powers of the heavens will be shaken and caused to totter. -- luke 21:26
.
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great (transcendent and overwhelming) power and [all His kingly] glory (majesty and splendor). -- luke 21:27
.
Now when these things begin to occur, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption (deliverance) is drawing near. -- luke 21:28
.
And He told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees; -- luke 21:29
.
When they put forth their buds and come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and perceive and know that summer is already near. -- luke 21:30
.
Even so, when you see these things taking place, understand and know that the kingdom of God is at hand. -- luke 21:31
.
Truly I tell you, this generation (those living at that definite period of time) will not perish and pass away until all has taken place. -- luke 21:32
.
The sky and the earth (the universe, the world) will pass away, but My words will not pass away. -- luke 21:33
.
But take heed to yourselves and be on your guard, lest your hearts be overburdened and depressed (weighed down) with the giddiness and headache and nausea of self-indulgence, drunkenness, and worldly worries and cares pertaining to [the business of] this life, and [lest] that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a noose; -- luke 21:34
.
For it will come upon all who live upon the face of the entire earth. -- luke 21:35
.
Keep awake then and watch at all times [be discreet, attentive, and ready], praying that you may have the full strength and ability and be accounted worthy to escape all these things [taken together] that will take place, and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man. -- luke 21:36
.
Now in the daytime Jesus was teaching in [the porches and courts of] the temple, but at night He would go out and stay on the mount called Olivet. -- luke 21:37
.
And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple [porches or courts] to listen to Him. -- luke 21:38
.
NOW THE Festival of Unleavened Bread was drawing near, which is called the Passover. -- luke 22:1
.
And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to do away with [Jesus], for they feared the people. -- luke 22:2
.
But [then] Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve [apostles]. -- luke 22:3
.
And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray Him and deliver Him up to them. -- luke 22:4
.
And they were delighted and pledged [themselves] to give him money. -- luke 22:5
.
So he agreed [to this], and sought an opportunity to betray Him to them [without an uprising] in the absence of the throng. -- luke 22:6
.
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover [lamb] had to be slain. -- luke 22:7
.
So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the Passover meal, that we may eat it. -- luke 22:8
.
They said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare [it]? -- luke 22:9
.
He said to them, Behold, when you have gone into the city, a man carrying an earthen jug or pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters, -- luke 22:10
.
And say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover [meal] with My disciples? -- luke 22:11
.
And he will show you a large room upstairs, furnished [with carpets and with couches properly spread]; there make [your] preparations. -- luke 22:12
.
And they went and found it [just] as He had said to them; and they made ready the Passover [supper]. -- luke 22:13
.
And when the hour came, [Jesus] reclined at table, and the apostles with Him. -- luke 22:14
.
And He said to them, I have earnestly and intensely desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; -- luke 22:15
.
For I say to you, I shall eat it no more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. -- luke 22:16
.
And He took a cup, and when He had given thanks, He said, Take this and divide and distribute it among yourselves; -- luke 22:17
.
For I say to you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine at all until the kingdom of God comes. -- luke 22:18
.
Then He took a loaf [of bread], and when He had given thanks, He broke [it] and gave it to them saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me. -- luke 22:19
.
And in like manner, He took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament or covenant [ratified] in My blood, which is shed (poured out) for you. -- luke 22:20
.
But, behold, the hand of him who is now engaged in betraying Me is with Me on the table. -- luke 22:21
.
For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined and appointed, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed and delivered up! -- luke 22:22
.
And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who was about to do this. -- luke 22:23
.
Now an eager contention arose among them [as to] which of them was considered and reputed to be the greatest. -- luke 22:24
.
But Jesus said to them, The kings of the Gentiles are deified by them and exercise lordship [ruling as emperor-gods] over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors and well-doers. -- luke 22:25
.
But this is not to be so with you; on the contrary, let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who is the chief and leader like one who serves. -- luke 22:26
.
For who is the greater, the one who reclines at table (the master), or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as One Who serves. -- luke 22:27
.
And you are those who have remained [throughout] and persevered with Me in My trials; -- luke 22:28
.
And as My Father has appointed a kingdom and conferred it on Me, so do I confer on you [the privilege and decree], -- luke 22:29
.
That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. -- luke 22:30
.
Simon, Simon (Peter), listen! Satan has asked excessively that [all of] you be given up to him [out of the power and keeping of God], that he might sift [all of] you like grain, -- luke 22:31
.
But I have prayed especially for you [Peter], that your [own] faith may not fail; and when you yourself have turned again, strengthen and establish your brethren. -- luke 22:32
.
And [Simon Peter] said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death. -- luke 22:33
.
But Jesus said, I tell you, Peter, before a [single] cock shall crow this day, you will three times [utterly] deny that you know Me. -- luke 22:34
.
And He said to them, When I sent you out with no purse or [provision] bag or sandals, did you lack anything? They answered, Nothing! -- luke 22:35
.
Then He said to them, But now let him who has a purse take it, and also [his provision] bag; and let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy a sword. -- luke 22:36
.
For I tell you that this Scripture must yet be fulfilled in Me: And He was counted and classed among the wicked (the outlaws, the criminals); for what is written about Me has its fulfillment [has reached its end and is finally settled]. -- luke 22:37
.
And they said, Look, Lord! Here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough. -- luke 22:38
.
And He came out and went, as was His habit, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed Him. -- luke 22:39
.
And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you may not [at all] enter into temptation. -- luke 22:40
.
And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw and knelt down and prayed, -- luke 22:41
.
Saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but [always] Yours be done. -- luke 22:42
.
And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him in spirit. -- luke 22:43
.
And being in an agony [of mind], He prayed [all the] more earnestly and intently, and His sweat became like great clots of blood dropping down upon the ground. -- luke 22:44
.
And when He got up from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from grief, -- luke 22:45
.
And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Get up and pray that you may not enter [at all] into temptation. -- luke 22:46
.
And while He was still speaking, behold, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve [apostles], was going before [leading] them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss Him, -- luke 22:47
.
But Jesus said to him, Judas! Would you betray and deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss? -- luke 22:48
.
And when those who were around Him saw what was about to happen, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword? -- luke 22:49
.
And one of them struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear, the right one. -- luke 22:50
.
But Jesus said, Permit them to go so far [as to seize Me]. And He touched the little (insignificant) ear and healed him. -- luke 22:51
.
Then Jesus said to those who had come out against Him--the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin]--Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber? -- luke 22:52
.
When I was with you day after day in the temple [enclosure], you did not stretch forth [your] hands against Me. But this is your hour--and the power [which] darkness [gives you has its way]. -- luke 22:53
.
Then they seized Him and led Him away, bringing Him into the house of the high priest. Peter was following at a distance. -- luke 22:54
.
And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were seated together, Peter sat among them. -- luke 22:55
.
Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and gazing [intently] at him, said, This man too was with Him. -- luke 22:56
.
But he denied it and said, Woman, I do not know Him! -- luke 22:57
.
And a little later someone else saw him and said, You are one of them also. But Peter said, Man, I am not! -- luke 22:58
.
And when about an hour more had elapsed, still another emphatically insisted, It is the truth that this man also was with Him, for he too is a Galilean! -- luke 22:59
.
But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are talking about. And instantly, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. -- luke 22:60
.
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter recalled the Lord's words, how He had told him, Before the cock crows today, you will deny Me thrice. -- luke 22:61
.
And he went out and wept bitterly [that is, with painfully moving grief]. -- luke 22:62
.
Now the men who had Jesus in custody treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him and beat Him; -- luke 22:63
.
They blindfolded Him also and asked Him, Prophesy! Who is it that struck You? -- luke 22:64
.
And they said many other evil and slanderous and insulting words against Him, reviling Him. -- luke 22:65
.
As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led Him into their council (the Sanhedrin), and they said, -- luke 22:66
.
If You are the Christ (the Messiah), tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe (trust in, cleave to, and rely on what I say), -- luke 22:67
.
And if I question you, you will not answer. -- luke 22:68
.
But hereafter (from this time on), the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God. -- luke 22:69
.
And they all said, You are the Son of God, then? And He said to them, It is just as you say; I AM. -- luke 22:70
.
And they said, What further evidence do we need? For we have heard [it] ourselves from His own mouth! -- luke 22:71
.
THEN THE whole assembly of them got up and conducted [Jesus] before Pilate. -- luke 23:1
.
And they began to accuse Him, asserting, We found this Man perverting (misleading, corrupting, and turning away) our nation and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One), a King! -- luke 23:2
.
So Pilate asked Him, Are You the King of the Jews? And He answered him, [It is just as] you say. [I AM.] -- luke 23:3
.
And Pilate said to the chief priests and the throngs, I find no guilt or crime in this Man. -- luke 23:4
.
But they were urgent and emphatic, saying, He stirs up and excites the people, teaching throughout all Judea--from Galilee, where He began, even to this place. -- luke 23:5
.
Upon hearing this, Pilate asked whether the Man was a Galilean. -- luke 23:6
.
And when he found out [certainly] that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him up to Herod [a higher authority], who was also in Jerusalem in those days. -- luke 23:7
.
Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had eagerly desired to see Him for a long time because of what he had heard concerning Him, and he was hoping to witness some sign (some striking evidence or spectacular performance) done by Him. -- luke 23:8
.
So he asked Him many questions, but He made no reply. -- luke 23:9
.
Meanwhile, the chief priests and the scribes stood by, continuing vehemently and violently to accuse Him. -- luke 23:10
.
And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him; then, dressing Him up in bright and gorgeous apparel, he sent Him back to Pilate. -- luke 23:11
.
And that very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other--[though] they had been at enmity before this. -- luke 23:12
.
Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, -- luke 23:13
.
And said to them, You brought this Man before me as One Who was perverting and misleading and turning away and corrupting the people; and behold, after examining Him before you, I have not found any offense (crime or guilt) in this Man in regard to your accusations against Him; -- luke 23:14
.
No, nor indeed did Herod, for he sent Him back to us; behold, He has done nothing deserving of death. -- luke 23:15
.
I will therefore chastise Him and deliver Him amended (reformed, taught His lesson) and release Him. -- luke 23:16
.
For it was necessary for him to release to them one prisoner at the Feast. -- luke 23:17
.
But they all together raised a deep cry [from the depths of their throats], saying, Away with this Man! Release to us Barabbas! -- luke 23:18
.
He was a man who had been thrown into prison for raising a riot in the city, and for murder. -- luke 23:19
.
Once more Pilate called to them, wishing to release Jesus; -- luke 23:20
.
But they kept shouting out, Crucify, crucify Him! -- luke 23:21
.
A third time he said to them, Why? What wrong has He done? I have found [no offense or crime or guilt] in Him nothing deserving of death; I will therefore chastise Him [in order to teach Him better] and release Him. -- luke 23:22
.
But they were insistent and urgent, demanding with loud cries that He should be crucified. And their voices prevailed (accomplished their purpose). -- luke 23:23
.
And Pilate gave sentence, that what they asked should be done. -- luke 23:24
.
So he released the man who had been thrown into prison for riot and murder, for whom they continued to ask, but Jesus he delivered up to be done with as they willed. -- luke 23:25
.
And as they led Him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross and made him carry it behind Jesus. -- luke 23:26
.
And there accompanied [Jesus] a great multitude of the people, [including] women who bewailed and lamented Him. -- luke 23:27
.
But Jesus, turning toward them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. -- luke 23:28
.
For behold, the days are coming during which they will say, Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the breasts that have never nursed [babies]! -- luke 23:29
.
Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover (conceal, hide) us! -- luke 23:30
.
For if they do these things when the timber is green, what will happen when it is dry? -- luke 23:31
.
Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be executed with Him. -- luke 23:32
.
And when they came to the place which is called The Skull [Latin: Calvary; Hebrew: Golgotha], there they crucified Him, and [along with] the criminals, one on the right and one on the left. -- luke 23:33
.
And Jesus prayed, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they divided His garments and distributed them by casting lots for them. -- luke 23:34
.
Now the people stood by [calmly and leisurely] watching; but the rulers scoffed and sneered (turned up their noses) at Him, saying, He rescued others [from death]; let Him now rescue Himself, if He is the Christ (the Messiah) of God, His Chosen One! -- luke 23:35
.
The soldiers also ridiculed and made sport of Him, coming up and offering Him vinegar (a sour wine mixed with water) -- luke 23:36
.
And saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save (rescue) Yourself [from death]. -- luke 23:37
.
For there was also an inscription above Him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew: This is the King of the Jews. -- luke 23:38
.
One of the criminals who was suspended kept up a railing at Him, saying, Are You not the Christ (the Messiah)? Rescue Yourself and us [from death]! -- luke 23:39
.
But the other one reproved him, saying, Do you not even fear God, seeing you yourself are under the same sentence of condemnation and suffering the same penalty? -- luke 23:40
.
And we indeed suffer it justly, receiving the due reward of our actions; but this Man has done nothing out of the way [nothing strange or eccentric or perverse or unreasonable]. -- luke 23:41
.
Then he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come in Your kingly glory! -- luke 23:42
.
And He answered him, Truly I tell you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise. -- luke 23:43
.
It was now about the sixth hour (midday), and darkness enveloped the whole land and earth until the ninth hour (about three o'clock in the afternoon), -- luke 23:44
.
While the sun's light faded or was darkened; and the curtain [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two. -- luke 23:45
.
And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit! And with these words, He expired. -- luke 23:46
.
Now the centurion, having seen what had taken place, recognized God and thanked and praised Him, and said, Indeed, without question, this Man was upright (just and innocent)! -- luke 23:47
.
And all the throngs that had gathered to see this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned to their homes, beating their breasts. -- luke 23:48
.
And all the acquaintances of [Jesus] and the women who had followed Him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched these things. -- luke 23:49
.
Now notice, there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council (the Sanhedrin), and a good (upright, advantageous) man, and righteous (in right standing with God and man), -- luke 23:50
.
Who had not agreed with or assented to the purpose and action of the others; and he was expecting and waiting for the kingdom of God. -- luke 23:51
.
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. -- luke 23:52
.
Then he took it down and rolled it up in a linen cloth for swathing dead bodies and laid Him in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid. -- luke 23:53
.
It was the day of Preparation [for the Sabbath], and the Sabbath was dawning (approaching). -- luke 23:54
.
The women who had come with [Jesus] from Galilee followed closely and saw the tomb and how His body was laid. -- luke 23:55
.
Then they went back and made ready spices and ointments (perfumes). On the Sabbath day they rested in accordance with the commandment. -- luke 23:56
.
BUT ON the first day of the week, at early dawn, [the women] went to the tomb, taking the spices which they had made ready. -- luke 24:1
.
And they found the stone rolled back from the tomb, -- luke 24:2
.
But when they went inside, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. -- luke 24:3
.
And while they were perplexed and wondering what to do about this, behold, two men in dazzling raiment suddenly stood beside them. -- luke 24:4
.
And as [the women] were frightened and were bowing their faces to the ground, the men said to them, Why do you look for the living among [those who are] dead? -- luke 24:5
.
He is not here, but has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee -- luke 24:6
.
That the Son of Man must be given over into the hands of sinful men (men whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God) and be crucified and on the third day rise [from death]. -- luke 24:7
.
And they remembered His words. -- luke 24:8
.
And having returned from the tomb, they reported all these things [taken together] to the eleven apostles and to all the rest. -- luke 24:9
.
Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who reported these things to the apostles. -- luke 24:10
.
But these reports seemed to the men an idle tale (madness, feigned things, nonsense), and they did not believe the women. -- luke 24:11
.
But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; and stooping down and looking in, he saw the linen cloths alone by themselves, and he went away, wondering about and marveling at what had happened. -- luke 24:12
.
And behold, that very day two of [the disciples] were going to a village called Emmaus, [which is] about seven miles from Jerusalem. -- luke 24:13
.
And they were talking with each other about all these things that had occurred. -- luke 24:14
.
And while they were conversing and discussing together, Jesus Himself caught up with them and was already accompanying them. -- luke 24:15
.
But their eyes were held, so that they did not recognize Him. -- luke 24:16
.
And He said to them, What is this discussion that you are exchanging (throwing back and forth) between yourselves as you walk along? And they stood still, looking sad and downcast. -- luke 24:17
.
Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered Him, Do you alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things that have occurred there in these days? -- luke 24:18
.
And He said to them, What [kind of] things? And they said to Him, About Jesus of Nazareth, Who was a Prophet mighty in work and word before God and all the people-- -- luke 24:19
.
And how our chief priests and rulers gave Him up to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him. -- luke 24:20
.
But we were hoping that it was He Who would redeem and set Israel free. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things occurred. -- luke 24:21
.
And moreover, some women of our company astounded us and drove us out of our senses. They were at the tomb early [in the morning] -- luke 24:22
.
But did not find His body; and they returned saying that they had [even] seen a vision of angels, who said that He was alive! -- luke 24:23
.
So some of those [who were] with us went to the tomb and they found it just as the women had said, but Him they did not see. -- luke 24:24
.
And [Jesus] said to them, O foolish ones [sluggish in mind, dull of perception] and slow of heart to believe (adhere to and trust in and rely on) everything that the prophets have spoken! -- luke 24:25
.
Was it not necessary and essentially fitting that the Christ (the Messiah) should suffer all these things before entering into His glory (His majesty and splendor)? -- luke 24:26
.
Then beginning with Moses and [throughout] all the Prophets, He went on explaining and interpreting to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning and referring to Himself. -- luke 24:27
.
Then they drew near the village to which they were going, and He acted as if He would go further. -- luke 24:28
.
But they urged and insisted, saying to Him, Remain with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. So He went in to stay with them. -- luke 24:29
.
And it occurred that as He reclined at table with them, He took [a loaf of] bread and praised [God] and gave thanks and asked a blessing, and then broke it and was giving it to them -- luke 24:30
.
When their eyes were [instantly] opened and they [clearly] recognized Him, and He vanished (departed invisibly). -- luke 24:31
.
And they said to one another, Were not our hearts greatly moved and burning within us while He was talking with us on the road and as He opened and explained to us [the sense of] the Scriptures? -- luke 24:32
.
And rising up that very hour, they went back to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven [apostles] gathered together and those who were with them, -- luke 24:33
.
Who said, The Lord really has risen and has appeared to Simon (Peter)! -- luke 24:34
.
Then they [themselves] related [in full] what had happened on the road, and how He was known and recognized by them in the breaking of bread. -- luke 24:35
.
Now while they were talking about this, Jesus Himself took His stand among them and said to them, Peace (freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin) be to you! -- luke 24:36
.
But they were so startled and terrified that they thought they saw a spirit. -- luke 24:37
.
And He said to them, Why are you disturbed and troubled, and why do such doubts and questionings arise in your hearts? -- luke 24:38
.
See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself! Feel and handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have. -- luke 24:39
.
And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. -- luke 24:40
.
And while [since] they still could not believe it for sheer joy and marveled, He said to them, Have you anything here to eat? -- luke 24:41
.
They gave Him a piece of broiled fish, -- luke 24:42
.
And He took [it] and ate [it] before them. -- luke 24:43
.
Then He said to them, This is what I told you while I was still with you: everything which is written concerning Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled. -- luke 24:44
.
Then He [thoroughly] opened up their minds to understand the Scriptures, -- luke 24:45
.
And said to them, Thus it is written that the Christ (the Messiah) should suffer and on the third day rise from (among) the dead, -- luke 24:46
.
And that repentance [with a view to and as the condition of] forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. -- luke 24:47
.
You are witnesses of these things. -- luke 24:48
.
And behold, I will send forth upon you what My Father has promised; but remain in the city [Jerusalem] until you are clothed with power from on high. -- luke 24:49
.
Then He conducted them out as far as Bethany, and, lifting up His hands, He invoked a blessing on them. -- luke 24:50
.
And it occurred that while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was taken up into heaven. -- luke 24:51
.
And they, worshiping Him, went back to Jerusalem with great joy; -- luke 24:52
.
And they were continually in the temple celebrating with praises and blessing and extolling God. Amen (so be it). -- luke 24:53
.
IN THE beginning [before all time] was the Word (Christ), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God Himself. -- john 1:1
.
He was present originally with God. -- john 1:2
.
All things were made and came into existence through Him; and without Him was not even one thing made that has come into being. -- john 1:3
.
In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men. -- john 1:4
.
And the Light shines on in the darkness, for the darkness has never overpowered it [put it out or absorbed it or appropriated it, and is unreceptive to it]. -- john 1:5
.
There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. -- john 1:6
.
This man came to witness, that he might testify of the Light, that all men might believe in it [adhere to it, trust it, and rely upon it] through him. -- john 1:7
.
He was not the Light himself, but came that he might bear witness regarding the Light. -- john 1:8
.
There it was--the true Light [was then] coming into the world [the genuine, perfect, steadfast Light] that illumines every person. -- john 1:9
.
He came into the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him [did not know Him]. -- john 1:10
.
He came to that which belonged to Him [to His own--His domain, creation, things, world], and they who were His own did not receive Him and did not welcome Him. -- john 1:11
.
But to as many as did receive and welcome Him, He gave the authority (power, privilege, right) to become the children of God, that is, to those who believe in (adhere to, trust in, and rely on) His name-- -- john 1:12
.
Who owe their birth neither to bloods nor to the will of the flesh [that of physical impulse] nor to the will of man [that of a natural father], but to God. [They are born of God!] -- john 1:13
.
And the Word (Christ) became flesh (human, incarnate) and tabernacled (fixed His tent of flesh, lived awhile) among us; and we [actually] saw His glory (His honor, His majesty), such glory as an only begotten son receives from his father, full of grace (favor, loving-kindness) and truth. -- john 1:14
.
John testified about Him and cried out, This was He of Whom I said, He Who comes after me has priority over me, for He was before me. [He takes rank above me, for He existed before I did. He has advanced before me, because He is my Chief.] -- john 1:15
.
For out of His fullness (abundance) we have all received [all had a share and we were all supplied with] one grace after another and spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing and even favor upon favor and gift [heaped] upon gift. -- john 1:16
.
For while the Law was given through Moses, grace (unearned, undeserved favor and spiritual blessing) and truth came through Jesus Christ. -- john 1:17
.
No man has ever seen God at any time; the only unique Son, or the only begotten God, Who is in the bosom [in the intimate presence] of the Father, He has declared Him [He has revealed Him and brought Him out where He can be seen; He has interpreted Him and He has made Him known]. -- john 1:18
.
And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? -- john 1:19
.
He confessed (admitted the truth) and did not try to conceal it, but acknowledged, I am not the Christ! -- john 1:20
.
They asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not! Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No! -- john 1:21
.
Then they said to him, Who are you? Tell us, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself? -- john 1:22
.
He said, I am the voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness [the voice of one shouting in the desert], Prepare the way of the Lord [level, straighten out, the path of the Lord], as the prophet Isaiah said. -- john 1:23
.
The messengers had been sent from the Pharisees. -- john 1:24
.
And they asked him, Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet? -- john 1:25
.
John answered them, I [only] baptize in (with) water. Among you there stands One Whom you do not recognize and with Whom you are not acquainted and of Whom you know nothing. -- john 1:26
.
It is He Who, coming after me, is preferred before me, the string of Whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose. -- john 1:27
.
These things occurred in Bethany (Bethabara) across the Jordan [at the Jordan crossing], where John was then baptizing. -- john 1:28
.
The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and said, Look! There is the Lamb of God, Who takes away the sin of the world! -- john 1:29
.
This is He of Whom I said, After me comes a Man Who has priority over me [Who takes rank above me] because He was before me and existed before I did. -- john 1:30
.
And I did not know Him and did not recognize Him [myself]; but it is in order that He should be made manifest and be revealed to Israel [be brought out where we can see Him] that I came baptizing in (with) water. -- john 1:31
.
John gave further evidence, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and it dwelt on Him [never to depart]. -- john 1:32
.
And I did not know Him nor recognize Him, but He Who sent me to baptize in (with) water said to me, Upon Him Whom you shall see the Spirit descend and remain, that One is He Who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. -- john 1:33
.
And I have seen [that happen--I actually did see it] and my testimony is that this is the Son of God! -- john 1:34
.
Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, -- john 1:35
.
And he looked at Jesus as He walked along, and said, Look! There is the Lamb of God! -- john 1:36
.
The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Him. -- john 1:37
.
But Jesus turned, and as He saw them following Him, He said to them, What are you looking for? [And what is it you wish?] And they answered Him, Rabbi--which translated is Teacher--where are You staying? -- john 1:38
.
He said to them, Come and see. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they remained with Him that day. It was then about the tenth hour (about four o'clock in the afternoon). -- john 1:39
.
One of the two who heard what John said and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. -- john 1:40
.
He first sought out and found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found (discovered) the Messiah!--which translated is the Christ (the Anointed One). -- john 1:41
.
Andrew then led (brought) Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, You are Simon son of John. You shall be called Cephas--which translated is Peter [Stone]. -- john 1:42
.
The next day Jesus desired and decided to go into Galilee; and He found Philip and said to him, Join Me as My attendant and follow Me. -- john 1:43
.
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the same city as Andrew and Peter. -- john 1:44
.
Philip sought and found Nathanael and told him, We have found (discovered) the One Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about--Jesus from Nazareth, the [legal] son of Joseph! -- john 1:45
.
Nathanael answered him, [Nazareth!] Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip replied, Come and see! -- john 1:46
.
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said concerning him, See! Here is an Israelite indeed [a true descendant of Jacob], in whom there is no guile nor deceit nor falsehood nor duplicity! -- john 1:47
.
Nathanael said to Jesus, How do You know me? [How is it that You know these things about me?] Jesus answered him, Before [ever] Philip called you, when you were still under the fig tree, I saw you. -- john 1:48
.
Nathanael answered, Teacher, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel! -- john 1:49
.
Jesus replied, Because I said to you, I saw you beneath the fig tree, do you believe in and rely on and trust in Me? You shall see greater things than this! -- john 1:50
.
Then He said to him, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you all, you shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man! -- john 1:51
.
ON THE third day there was a wedding at Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. -- john 2:1
.
Jesus also was invited with His disciples to the wedding. -- john 2:2
.
And when the wine was all gone, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no more wine! -- john 2:3
.
Jesus said to her, [Dear] woman, what is that to you and to Me? [What do we have in common? Leave it to Me.] My time (hour to act) has not yet come. -- john 2:4
.
His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do it. -- john 2:5
.
Now there were six waterpots of stone standing there, as the Jewish custom of purification (ceremonial washing) demanded, holding twenty to thirty gallons apiece. -- john 2:6
.
Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. So they filled them up to the brim. -- john 2:7
.
Then He said to them, Draw some out now and take it to the manager of the feast [to the one presiding, the superintendent of the banquet]. So they took him some. -- john 2:8
.
And when the manager tasted the water just now turned into wine, not knowing where it came from--though the servants who had drawn the water knew--he called the bridegroom -- john 2:9
.
And said to him, Everyone else serves his best wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then he serves that which is not so good; but you have kept back the good wine until now! -- john 2:10
.
This, the first of His signs (miracles, wonderworks), Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory [by it He displayed His greatness and His power openly], and His disciples believed in Him [adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Him]. -- john 2:11
.
After that He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and disciples, and they stayed there only a few days. -- john 2:12
.
Now the Passover of the Jews was approaching, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem. -- john 2:13
.
There He found in the temple [enclosure] those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers sitting there [also at their stands]. -- john 2:14
.
And having made a lash (a whip) of cords, He drove them all out of the temple [enclosure]--both the sheep and the oxen--spilling and scattering the brokers' money and upsetting and tossing around their trays (their stands). -- john 2:15
.
Then to those who sold the doves He said, Take these things away (out of here)! Make not My Father's house a house of merchandise (a marketplace, a sales shop)! -- john 2:16
.
And His disciples remembered that it is written [in the Holy Scriptures], Zeal (the fervor of love) for Your house will eat Me up. [I will be consumed with jealousy for the honor of Your house.] -- john 2:17
.
Then the Jews retorted, What sign can You show us, seeing You do these things? [What sign, miracle, token, indication can You give us as evidence that You have authority and are commissioned to act in this way?] -- john 2:18
.
Jesus answered them, Destroy (undo) this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again. -- john 2:19
.
Then the Jews replied, It took forty-six years to build this temple (sanctuary), and will You raise it up in three days? -- john 2:20
.
But He had spoken of the temple which was His body. -- john 2:21
.
When therefore He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this. And so they believed and trusted and relied on the Scripture and the word (message) Jesus had spoken. -- john 2:22
.
But when He was in Jerusalem during the Passover Feast, many believed in His name [identified themselves with His party] after seeing His signs (wonders, miracles) which He was doing. -- john 2:23
.
But Jesus [for His part] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew all [men]; -- john 2:24
.
And He did not need anyone to bear witness concerning man [needed no evidence from anyone about men], for He Himself knew what was in human nature. [He could read men's hearts.] [I Sam. 16:7.] -- john 2:25
.
NOW THERE was a certain man among the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler (a leader, an authority) among the Jews, -- john 3:1
.
Who came to Jesus at night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know and are certain that You have come from God [as] a Teacher; for no one can do these signs (these wonderworks, these miracles--and produce the proofs) that You do unless God is with him. -- john 3:2
.
Jesus answered him, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, that unless a person is born again (anew, from above), he cannot ever see (know, be acquainted with, and experience) the kingdom of God. -- john 3:3
.
Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother's womb again and be born? -- john 3:4
.
Jesus answered, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, unless a man is born of water and [even] the Spirit, he cannot [ever] enter the kingdom of God. -- john 3:5
.
What is born of [from] the flesh is flesh [of the physical is physical]; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. -- john 3:6
.
Marvel not [do not be surprised, astonished] at My telling you, You must all be born anew (from above). -- john 3:7
.
The wind blows (breathes) where it wills; and though you hear its sound, yet you neither know where it comes from nor where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit. -- john 3:8
.
Nicodemus answered by asking, How can all this be possible? -- john 3:9
.
Jesus replied, Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet do not know nor understand these things? [Are they strange to you?] -- john 3:10
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, We speak only of what we know [we know absolutely what we are talking about]; we have actually seen what we are testifying to [we were eyewitnesses of it]. And still you do not receive our testimony [you reject and refuse our evidence--that of Myself and of all those who are born of the Spirit]. -- john 3:11
.
If I have told you of things that happen right here on the earth and yet none of you believes Me, how can you believe (trust Me, adhere to Me, rely on Me) if I tell you of heavenly things? -- john 3:12
.
And yet no one has ever gone up to heaven, but there is One Who has come down from heaven--the Son of Man [Himself], Who is (dwells, has His home) in heaven. -- john 3:13
.
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert [on a pole], so must [so it is necessary that] the Son of Man be lifted up [on the cross], -- john 3:14
.
In order that everyone who believes in Him [who cleaves to Him, trusts Him, and relies on Him] may not perish, but have eternal life and [actually] live forever! -- john 3:15
.
For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten (unique) Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction, be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life. -- john 3:16
.
For God did not send the Son into the world in order to judge (to reject, to condemn, to pass sentence on) the world, but that the world might find salvation and be made safe and sound through Him. -- john 3:17
.
He who believes in Him [who clings to, trusts in, relies on Him] is not judged [he who trusts in Him never comes up for judgment; for him there is no rejection, no condemnation--he incurs no damnation]; but he who does not believe (cleave to, rely on, trust in Him) is judged already [he has already been convicted and has already received his sentence] because he has not believed in and trusted in the name of the only begotten Son of God. [He is condemned for refusing to let his trust rest in Christ's name.] -- john 3:18
.
The [basis of the] judgment (indictment, the test by which men are judged, the ground for the sentence) lies in this: the Light has come into the world, and people have loved the darkness rather than and more than the Light, for their works (deeds) were evil. -- john 3:19
.
For every wrongdoer hates (loathes, detests) the Light, and will not come out into the Light but shrinks from it, lest his works (his deeds, his activities, his conduct) be exposed and reproved. -- john 3:20
.
But he who practices truth [who does what is right] comes out into the Light; so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are--wrought with God [divinely prompted, done with God's help, in dependence upon Him]. -- john 3:21
.
After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the land (the countryside) of Judea, where He remained with them, and baptized. -- john 3:22
.
But John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, for there was an abundance of water there, and the people kept coming and being baptized. -- john 3:23
.
For John had not yet been thrown into prison. -- john 3:24
.
Therefore there arose a controversy between some of John's disciples and a Jew in regard to purification. -- john 3:25
.
So they came to John and reported to him, Rabbi, the Man Who was with you on the other side of the Jordan [at the Jordan crossing]--and to Whom you yourself have borne testimony--notice, here He is baptizing too, and everybody is flocking to Him! -- john 3:26
.
John answered, A man can receive nothing [he can claim nothing, he can take unto himself nothing] except as it has been granted to him from heaven. [A man must be content to receive the gift which is given him from heaven; there is no other source.] -- john 3:27
.
You yourselves are my witnesses [you personally bear me out] that I stated, I am not the Christ (the Anointed One, the Messiah), but I have [only] been sent before Him [in advance of Him, to be His appointed forerunner, His messenger, His announcer]. -- john 3:28
.
He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the groomsman who stands by and listens to him rejoices greatly and heartily on account of the bridegroom's voice. This then is my pleasure and joy, and it is now complete. [S. of Sol. 5:1.] -- john 3:29
.
He must increase, but I must decrease. [He must grow more prominent; I must grow less so.] -- john 3:30
.
He Who comes from above (heaven) is [far] above all [others]; he who comes from the earth belongs to the earth, and talks the language of earth [his words are from an earthly standpoint]. He Who comes from heaven is [far] above all others [far superior to all others in prominence and in excellence]. -- john 3:31
.
It is to what He has [actually] seen and heard that He bears testimony, and yet no one accepts His testimony [no one receives His evidence as true]. -- john 3:32
.
Whoever receives His testimony has set his seal of approval to this: God is true. [That man has definitely certified, acknowledged, declared once and for all, and is himself assured that it is divine truth that God cannot lie]. -- john 3:33
.
For since He Whom God has sent speaks the words of God [proclaims God's own message], God does not give Him His Spirit sparingly or by measure, but boundless is the gift God makes of His Spirit! -- john 3:34
.
The Father loves the Son and has given (entrusted, committed) everything into His hand. -- john 3:35
.
And he who believes in (has faith in, clings to, relies on) the Son has (now possesses) eternal life. But whoever disobeys (is unbelieving toward, refuses to trust in, disregards, is not subject to) the Son will never see (experience) life, but [instead] the wrath of God abides on him. [God's displeasure remains on him; His indignation hangs over him continually.] -- john 3:36
.
NOW WHEN the Lord knew (learned, became aware) that the Pharisees had been told that Jesus was winning and baptizing more disciples than John-- -- john 4:1
.
Though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples-- -- john 4:2
.
He left Judea and returned to Galilee. -- john 4:3
.
It was necessary for Him to go through Samaria. -- john 4:4
.
And in doing so, He arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the tract of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. -- john 4:5
.
And Jacob's well was there. So Jesus, tired as He was from His journey, sat down [to rest] by the well. It was then about the sixth hour (about noon). -- john 4:6
.
Presently, when a woman of Samaria came along to draw water, Jesus said to her, Give Me a drink-- -- john 4:7
.
For His disciples had gone off into the town to buy food-- -- john 4:8
.
The Samaritan woman said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan [and a] woman, for a drink?--For the Jews have nothing to do with the Samaritans-- -- john 4:9
.
Jesus answered her, If you had only known and had recognized God's gift and Who this is that is saying to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him [instead] and He would have given you living water. -- john 4:10
.
She said to Him, Sir, You have nothing to draw with [no drawing bucket] and the well is deep; how then can You provide living water? [Where do You get Your living water?] -- john 4:11
.
Are You greater than and superior to our ancestor Jacob, who gave us this well and who used to drink from it himself, and his sons and his cattle also? -- john 4:12
.
Jesus answered her, All who drink of this water will be thirsty again. -- john 4:13
.
But whoever takes a drink of the water that I will give him shall never, no never, be thirsty any more. But the water that I will give him shall become a spring of water welling up (flowing, bubbling) [continually] within him unto (into, for) eternal life. -- john 4:14
.
The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may never get thirsty nor have to come [continually all the way] here to draw. -- john 4:15
.
At this, Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband and come back here. -- john 4:16
.
The woman answered, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have spoken truly in saying, I have no husband. -- john 4:17
.
For you have had five husbands, and the man you are now living with is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly. -- john 4:18
.
The woman said to Him, Sir, I see and understand that You are a prophet. -- john 4:19
.
Our forefathers worshiped on this mountain, but you [Jews] say that Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary and proper to worship. -- john 4:20
.
Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither [merely] in this mountain nor [merely] in Jerusalem. -- john 4:21
.
You [Samaritans] do not know what you are worshiping [you worship what you do not comprehend]. We do know what we are worshiping [we worship what we have knowledge of and understand], for [after all] salvation comes from [among] the Jews. -- john 4:22
.
A time will come, however, indeed it is already here, when the true (genuine) worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth (reality); for the Father is seeking just such people as these as His worshipers. -- john 4:23
.
God is a Spirit (a spiritual Being) and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth (reality). -- john 4:24
.
The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming, He Who is called the Christ (the Anointed One); and when He arrives, He will tell us everything we need to know and make it clear to us. -- john 4:25
.
Jesus said to her, I Who now speak with you am He. -- john 4:26
.
Just then His disciples came and they wondered (were surprised, astonished) to find Him talking with a woman [a married woman]. However, not one of them asked Him, What are You inquiring about? or What do You want? or, Why do You speak with her? -- john 4:27
.
Then the woman left her water jar and went away to the town. And she began telling the people, -- john 4:28
.
Come, see a Man Who has told me everything that I ever did! Can this be [is not this] the Christ? [Must not this be the Messiah, the Anointed One?] -- john 4:29
.
So the people left the town and set out to go to Him. -- john 4:30
.
Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him saying, Rabbi, eat something. -- john 4:31
.
But He assured them, I have food (nourishment) to eat of which you know nothing and have no idea. -- john 4:32
.
So the disciples said one to another, Has someone brought Him something to eat? -- john 4:33
.
Jesus said to them, My food (nourishment) is to do the will (pleasure) of Him Who sent Me and to accomplish and completely finish His work. -- john 4:34
.
Do you not say, It is still four months until harvest time comes? Look! I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields and see how they are already white for harvesting. -- john 4:35
.
Already the reaper is getting his wages [he who does the cutting now has his reward], for he is gathering fruit (crop) unto life eternal, so that he who does the planting and he who does the reaping may rejoice together. -- john 4:36
.
For in this the saying holds true, One sows and another reaps. -- john 4:37
.
I sent you to reap a crop for which you have not toiled. Other men have labored and you have stepped in to reap the results of their work. -- john 4:38
.
Now numerous Samaritans from that town believed in and trusted in Him because of what the woman said when she declared and testified, He told me everything that I ever did. -- john 4:39
.
So when the Samaritans arrived, they asked Him to remain with them, and He did stay there two days. -- john 4:40
.
Then many more believed in and adhered to and relied on Him because of His personal message [what He Himself said]. -- john 4:41
.
And they told the woman, Now we no longer believe (trust, have faith) just because of what you said; for we have heard Him ourselves [personally], and we know that He truly is the Savior of the world, the Christ. -- john 4:42
.
But after these two days Jesus went on from there into Galilee-- -- john 4:43
.
Although He Himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country. -- john 4:44
.
However, when He came into Galilee, the Galileans also welcomed Him and took Him to their hearts eagerly, for they had seen everything that He did in Jerusalem during the Feast; for they too had attended the Feast. -- john 4:45
.
So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son was lying ill in Capernaum. -- john 4:46
.
Having heard that Jesus had come back from Judea into Galilee, he went away to meet Him and began to beg Him to come down and cure his son, for he was lying at the point of death. -- john 4:47
.
Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and miracles happen, you [people] never will believe (trust, have faith) at all. -- john 4:48
.
The king's officer pleaded with Him, Sir, do come down at once before my little child is dead! -- john 4:49
.
Jesus answered him, Go in peace; your son will live! And the man put his trust in what Jesus said and started home. -- john 4:50
.
But even as he was on the road going down, his servants met him and reported, saying, Your son lives! -- john 4:51
.
So he asked them at what time he had begun to get better. They said, Yesterday during the seventh hour (about one o'clock in the afternoon) the fever left him. -- john 4:52
.
Then the father knew that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him, Your son will live. And he and his entire household believed (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Jesus). -- john 4:53
.
This is the second sign (wonderwork, miracle) that Jesus performed after He had come out of Judea into Galilee. -- john 4:54
.
LATER ON there was a Jewish festival (feast) for which Jesus went up to Jerusalem. -- john 5:1
.
Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep Gate. This pool in the Hebrew is called Bethesda, having five porches (alcoves, colonnades, doorways). -- john 5:2
.
In these lay a great number of sick folk--some blind, some crippled, and some paralyzed (shriveled up)--waiting for the bubbling up of the water. -- john 5:3
.
For an angel of the Lord went down at appointed seasons into the pool and moved and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was cured of whatever disease with which he was afflicted. -- john 5:4
.
There was a certain man there who had suffered with a deep-seated and lingering disorder for thirty-eight years. -- john 5:5
.
When Jesus noticed him lying there [helpless], knowing that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to become well? [Are you really in earnest about getting well?] -- john 5:6
.
The invalid answered, Sir, I have nobody when the water is moving to put me into the pool; but while I am trying to come [into it] myself, somebody else steps down ahead of me. -- john 5:7
.
Jesus said to him, Get up! Pick up your bed (sleeping pad) and walk! -- john 5:8
.
Instantly the man became well and recovered his strength and picked up his bed and walked. But that happened on the Sabbath. -- john 5:9
.
So the Jews kept saying to the man who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and you have no right to pick up your bed [it is not lawful]. -- john 5:10
.
He answered them, The Man Who healed me and gave me back my strength, He Himself said to me, Pick up your bed and walk! -- john 5:11
.
They asked him, Who is the Man Who told you, Pick up your bed and walk? -- john 5:12
.
Now the invalid who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had quietly gone away [had passed on unnoticed], since there was a crowd in the place. -- john 5:13
.
Afterward, when Jesus found him in the temple, He said to him, See, you are well! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you. -- john 5:14
.
The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus Who had made him well. -- john 5:15
.
For this reason the Jews began to persecute (annoy, torment) Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath. -- john 5:16
.
But Jesus answered them, My Father has worked [even] until now, [He has never ceased working; He is still working] and I, too, must be at [divine] work. -- john 5:17
.
This made the Jews more determined than ever to kill Him [to do away with Him]; because He not only was breaking (weakening, violating) the Sabbath, but He actually was speaking of God as being [in a special sense] His own Father, making Himself equal [putting Himself on a level] with God. -- john 5:18
.
So Jesus answered them by saying, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, the Son is able to do nothing of Himself (of His own accord); but He is able to do only what He sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father does is what the Son does in the same way [in His turn]. -- john 5:19
.
The Father dearly loves the Son and discloses to (shows) Him everything that He Himself does. And He will disclose to Him (let Him see) greater things yet than these, so that you may marvel and be full of wonder and astonishment. -- john 5:20
.
Just as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life [makes them live on], even so the Son also gives life to whomever He wills and is pleased to give it. -- john 5:21
.
Even the Father judges no one, for He has given all judgment (the last judgment and the whole business of judging) entirely into the hands of the Son, -- john 5:22
.
So that all men may give honor (reverence, homage) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father. [In fact] whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, Who has sent Him. -- john 5:23
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, the person whose ears are open to My words [who listens to My message] and believes and trusts in and clings to and relies on Him Who sent Me has (possesses now) eternal life. And he does not come into judgment [does not incur sentence of judgment, will not come under condemnation], but he has already passed over out of death into life. -- john 5:24
.
Believe Me when I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, the time is coming and is here now when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear it shall live. -- john 5:25
.
For even as the Father has life in Himself and is self-existent, so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself and be self-existent. -- john 5:26
.
And He has given Him authority and granted Him power to execute (exercise, practice) judgment because He is a Son of man [very man]. -- john 5:27
.
Do not be surprised and wonder at this, for the time is coming when all those who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, -- john 5:28
.
And they shall come out--those who have practiced doing good [will come out] to the resurrection of [new] life, and those who have done evil will be raised for judgment [raised to meet their sentence]. -- john 5:29
.
I am able to do nothing from Myself [independently, of My own accord--but only as I am taught by God and as I get His orders]. Even as I hear, I judge [I decide as I am bidden to decide. As the voice comes to Me, so I give a decision], and My judgment is right (just, righteous), because I do not seek or consult My own will [I have no desire to do what is pleasing to Myself, My own aim, My own purpose] but only the will and pleasure of the Father Who sent Me. -- john 5:30
.
If I alone testify in My behalf, My testimony is not valid and cannot be worth anything. -- john 5:31
.
There is Another Who testifies concerning Me, and I know and am certain that His evidence on My behalf is true and valid. -- john 5:32
.
You yourselves have sent [an inquiry] to John and he has been a witness to the truth. -- john 5:33
.
But I do not receive [a mere] human witness [the evidence which I accept on My behalf is not from man]; but I simply mention all these things in order that you may be saved (made and kept safe and sound). -- john 5:34
.
John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [to show you the way], and you were willing for a while to delight (sun) yourselves in his light. -- john 5:35
.
But I have as My witness something greater (weightier, higher, better) than that of John; for the works that the Father has appointed Me to accomplish and finish, the very same works that I am now doing, are a witness and proof that the Father has sent Me. -- john 5:36
.
And the Father Who sent Me has Himself testified concerning Me. Not one of you has ever given ear to His voice or seen His form (His face--what He is like). [You have always been deaf to His voice and blind to the vision of Him.] -- john 5:37
.
And you have not His word (His thought) living in your hearts, because you do not believe and adhere to and trust in and rely on Him Whom He has sent. [That is why you do not keep His message living in you, because you do not believe in the Messenger Whom He has sent.] -- john 5:38
.
You search and investigate and pore over the Scriptures diligently, because you suppose and trust that you have eternal life through them. And these [very Scriptures] testify about Me! -- john 5:39
.
And still you are not willing [but refuse] to come to Me, so that you might have life. -- john 5:40
.
I receive not glory from men [I crave no human honor, I look for no mortal fame], -- john 5:41
.
But I know you and recognize and understand that you have not the love of God in you. -- john 5:42
.
I have come in My Father's name and with His power, and you do not receive Me [your hearts are not open to Me, you give Me no welcome]; but if another comes in his own name and his own power and with no other authority but himself, you will receive him and give him your approval. -- john 5:43
.
How is it possible for you to believe [how can you learn to believe], you who [are content to seek and] receive praise and honor and glory from one another, and yet do not seek the praise and honor and glory which come from Him Who alone is God? -- john 5:44
.
Put out of your minds the thought and do not suppose [as some of you are supposing] that I will accuse you before the Father. There is one who accuses you--it is Moses, the very one on whom you have built your hopes [in whom you trust]. -- john 5:45
.
For if you believed and relied on Moses, you would believe and rely on Me, for he wrote about Me [personally]. -- john 5:46
.
But if you do not believe and trust his writings, how then will you believe and trust My teachings? [How shall you cleave to and rely on My words?] -- john 5:47
.
AFTER THIS, Jesus went to the farther side of the Sea of Galilee--that is, the Sea of Tiberias. -- john 6:1
.
And a great crowd was following Him because they had seen the signs (miracles) which He [continually] performed upon those who were sick. -- john 6:2
.
And Jesus walked up the mountainside and sat down there with His disciples. -- john 6:3
.
Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was approaching. -- john 6:4
.
Jesus looked up then, and seeing that a vast multitude was coming toward Him, He said to Philip, Where are we to buy bread, so that all these people may eat? -- john 6:5
.
But He said this to prove (test) him, for He well knew what He was about to do. -- john 6:6
.
Philip answered Him, Two hundred pennies' (forty dollars) worth of bread is not enough that everyone may receive even a little. -- john 6:7
.
Another of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him, -- john 6:8
.
There is a little boy here, who has [with him] five barley loaves, and two small fish; but what are they among so many people? -- john 6:9
.
Jesus said, Make all the people recline (sit down). Now the ground (a pasture) was covered with thick grass at the spot, so the men threw themselves down, about 5,in number. -- john 6:10
.
Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to the disciples and the disciples to the reclining people; so also [He did] with the fish, as much as they wanted. -- john 6:11
.
When they had all had enough, He said to His disciples, Gather up now the fragments (the broken pieces that are left over), so that nothing may be lost and wasted. -- john 6:12
.
So accordingly they gathered them up, and they filled twelve [small hand] baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves. -- john 6:13
.
When the people saw the sign (miracle) that Jesus had performed, they began saying, Surely and beyond a doubt this is the Prophet Who is to come into the world! -- john 6:14
.
Then Jesus, knowing that they meant to come and seize Him that they might make Him king, withdrew again to the hillside by Himself alone. -- john 6:15
.
When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, -- john 6:16
.
And they took a boat and were going across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and still Jesus had not [yet] come back to them. -- john 6:17
.
Meanwhile, the sea was getting rough and rising high because of a great and violent wind that was blowing. -- john 6:18
.
[However] when they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat. And they were afraid (terrified). -- john 6:19
.
But Jesus said to them, It is I; be not afraid! [I AM; stop being frightened!] -- john 6:20
.
Then they were quite willing and glad for Him to come into the boat. And now the boat went at once to the land they had steered toward. [And immediately they reached the shore toward which they had been slowly making their way.] -- john 6:21
.
The next day the crowd [that still remained] standing on the other side of the sea realized that there had been only one small boat there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away by themselves. -- john 6:22
.
But now some other boats from Tiberias had come in near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. -- john 6:23
.
So the people, finding that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus. -- john 6:24
.
And when they found Him on the other side of the lake, they said to Him, Rabbi! When did You come here? -- john 6:25
.
Jesus answered them, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, you have been searching for Me, not because you saw the miracles and signs but because you were fed with the loaves and were filled and satisfied. -- john 6:26
.
Stop toiling and doing and producing for the food that perishes and decomposes [in the using], but strive and work and produce rather for the [lasting] food which endures [continually] unto life eternal; the Son of Man will give (furnish) you that, for God the Father has authorized and certified Him and put His seal of endorsement upon Him. -- john 6:27
.
They then said, What are we to do, that we may [habitually] be working the works of God? [What are we to do to carry out what God requires?] -- john 6:28
.
Jesus replied, This is the work (service) that God asks of you: that you believe in the One Whom He has sent [that you cleave to, trust, rely on, and have faith in His Messenger]. -- john 6:29
.
Therefore they said to Him, What sign (miracle, wonderwork) will You perform then, so that we may see it and believe and rely on and adhere to You? What [supernatural] work have You [to show what You can do]? -- john 6:30
.
Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as the Scripture says, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. -- john 6:31
.
Jesus then said to them, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, Moses did not give you the Bread from heaven [what Moses gave you was not the Bread from heaven], but it is My Father Who gives you the true heavenly Bread. -- john 6:32
.
For the Bread of God is He Who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world. -- john 6:33
.
Then they said to Him, Lord, give us this bread always (all the time)! -- john 6:34
.
Jesus replied, I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to Me will never be hungry, and he who believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me will never thirst any more (at any time). -- john 6:35
.
But [as] I told you, although you have seen Me, still you do not believe and trust and have faith. -- john 6:36
.
All whom My Father gives (entrusts) to Me will come to Me; and the one who comes to Me I will most certainly not cast out [I will never, no never, reject one of them who comes to Me]. -- john 6:37
.
For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will and purpose but to do the will and purpose of Him Who sent Me. -- john 6:38
.
And this is the will of Him Who sent Me, that I should not lose any of all that He has given Me, but that I should give new life and raise [them all] up at the last day. -- john 6:39
.
For this is My Father's will and His purpose, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up [from the dead] at the last day. -- john 6:40
.
Now the Jews murmured and found fault with and grumbled about Jesus because He said, I am [Myself] the Bread that came down from heaven. -- john 6:41
.
They kept asking, Is not this Jesus, the Son of Joseph, Whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, I have come down from heaven? -- john 6:42
.
So Jesus answered them, Stop grumbling and saying things against Me to one another. -- john 6:43
.
No one is able to come to Me unless the Father Who sent Me attracts and draws him and gives him the desire to come to Me, and [then] I will raise him up [from the dead] at the last day. -- john 6:44
.
It is written in [the book of] the Prophets, And they shall all be taught of God [have Him in person for their Teacher]. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me-- -- john 6:45
.
Which does not imply that anyone has seen the Father [not that anyone has ever seen Him] except He [Who was with the Father] Who comes from God; He [alone] has seen the Father. -- john 6:46
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, he who believes in Me [who adheres to, trusts in, relies on, and has faith in Me] has (now possesses) eternal life. -- john 6:47
.
I am the Bread of Life [that gives life--the Living Bread]. -- john 6:48
.
Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and [yet] they died. -- john 6:49
.
[But] this is the Bread that comes down from heaven, so that [any]one may eat of it and never die. -- john 6:50
.
I [Myself] am this Living Bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he will live forever; and also the Bread that I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh (body). -- john 6:51
.
Then the Jews angrily contended with one another, saying, How is He able to give us His flesh to eat? -- john 6:52
.
And Jesus said to them, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, you cannot have any life in you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood [unless you appropriate His life and the saving merit of His blood]. -- john 6:53
.
He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood has (possesses now) eternal life, and I will raise him up [from the dead] on the last day. -- john 6:54
.
For My flesh is true and genuine food, and My blood is true and genuine drink. -- john 6:55
.
He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood dwells continually in Me, and I [in like manner dwell continually] in him. -- john 6:56
.
Just as the living Father sent Me and I live by (through, because of) the Father, even so whoever continues to feed on Me [whoever takes Me for his food and is nourished by Me] shall [in his turn] live through and because of Me. -- john 6:57
.
This is the Bread that came down from heaven. It is not like the manna which our forefathers ate, and yet died; he who takes this Bread for his food shall live forever. -- john 6:58
.
He said these things in a synagogue while He was teaching at Capernaum. -- john 6:59
.
When His disciples heard this, many of them said, This is a hard and difficult and strange saying (an offensive and unbearable message). Who can stand to hear it? [Who can be expected to listen to such teaching?] -- john 6:60
.
But Jesus, knowing within Himself that His disciples were complaining and protesting and grumbling about it, said to them: Is this a stumbling block and an offense to you? [Does this upset and displease and shock and scandalize you?] -- john 6:61
.
What then [will be your reaction] if you should see the Son of Man ascending to [the place] where He was before? -- john 6:62
.
It is the Spirit Who gives life [He is the Life-giver]; the flesh conveys no benefit whatever [there is no profit in it]. The words (truths) that I have been speaking to you are spirit and life. -- john 6:63
.
But [still] some of you fail to believe and trust and have faith. For Jesus knew from the first who did not believe and had no faith and who would betray Him and be false to Him. -- john 6:64
.
And He said, This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted him [unless he is enabled to do so] by the Father. -- john 6:65
.
After this, many of His disciples drew back (returned to their old associations) and no longer accompanied Him. -- john 6:66
.
Jesus said to the Twelve, Will you also go away? [And do you too desire to leave Me?] -- john 6:67
.
Simon Peter answered, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words (the message) of eternal life. -- john 6:68
.
And we have learned to believe and trust, and [more] we have come to know [surely] that You are the Holy One of God, the Christ (the Anointed One), the Son of the living God. -- john 6:69
.
Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the Twelve? And [yet] one of you is a devil (of the evil one and a false accuser). -- john 6:70
.
He was speaking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he was about to betray Him, [although] he was one of the Twelve. -- john 6:71
.
AFTER THIS, Jesus went from place to place in Galilee, for He would not travel in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him. -- john 7:1
.
Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was drawing near. -- john 7:2
.
So His brothers said to Him, Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples [there] may also see the works that You do. [This is no place for You.] -- john 7:3
.
For no one does anything in secret when he wishes to be conspicuous and secure publicity. If You [must] do these things [if You must act like this], show Yourself openly and make Yourself known to the world! -- john 7:4
.
For [even] His brothers did not believe in or adhere to or trust in or rely on Him either. -- john 7:5
.
Whereupon Jesus said to them, My time (opportunity) has not come yet; but any time is suitable for you and your opportunity is ready any time [is always here]. -- john 7:6
.
The world cannot [be expected to] hate you, but it does hate Me because I denounce it for its wicked works and reveal that its doings are evil. -- john 7:7
.
Go to the Feast yourselves. I am not [yet] going up to the Festival, because My time is not ripe. [My term is not yet completed; it is not time for Me to go.] -- john 7:8
.
Having said these things to them, He stayed behind in Galilee. -- john 7:9
.
But afterward, when His brothers had gone up to the Feast, He went up also, not publicly [not with a caravan], but by Himself quietly and as if He did not wish to be observed. -- john 7:10
.
Therefore the Jews kept looking for Him at the Feast and asking, Where can He be? [Where is that Fellow?] -- john 7:11
.
And there was among the mass of the people much whispered discussion and hot disputing about Him. Some were saying, He is good! [He is a good Man!] Others said, No, He misleads and deceives the people [gives them false ideas]! -- john 7:12
.
But no one dared speak out boldly about Him for fear of [the leaders of] the Jews. -- john 7:13
.
When the Feast was already half over, Jesus went up into the temple [court] and began to teach. -- john 7:14
.
The Jews were astonished. They said, How is it that this Man has learning [is so versed in the sacred Scriptures and in theology] when He has never studied? -- john 7:15
.
Jesus answered them by saying, My teaching is not My own, but His Who sent Me. -- john 7:16
.
If any man desires to do His will (God's pleasure), he will know (have the needed illumination to recognize, and can tell for himself) whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking from Myself and of My own accord and on My own authority. -- john 7:17
.
He who speaks on his own authority seeks to win honor for himself. [He whose teaching originates with himself seeks his own glory.] But He Who seeks the glory and is eager for the honor of Him Who sent Him, He is true; and there is no unrighteousness or falsehood or deception in Him. -- john 7:18
.
Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not one of you keeps the Law. [If that is the truth] why do you seek to kill Me [for not keeping it]? -- john 7:19
.
The crowd answered Him, You are possessed by a demon! [You are raving!] Who seeks to kill You? -- john 7:20
.
Jesus answered them, I did one work, and you all are astounded. -- john 7:21
.
Now Moses established circumcision among you--though it did not originate with Moses but with the previous patriarchs--and you circumcise a person [even] on the Sabbath day. -- john 7:22
.
If, to avoid breaking the Law of Moses, a person undergoes circumcision on the Sabbath day, have you any cause to be angry with (indignant with, bitter against) Me for making a man's whole body well on the Sabbath? -- john 7:23
.
Be honest in your judgment and do not decide at a glance (superficially and by appearances); but judge fairly and righteously. -- john 7:24
.
Then some of the Jerusalem people said, Is not this the Man they seek to kill? -- john 7:25
.
And here He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him! Can it be possible that the rulers have discovered and know that this is truly the Christ? -- john 7:26
.
No, we know where this Man comes from; when the Christ arrives, no one is to know from what place He comes. -- john 7:27
.
Whereupon Jesus called out as He taught in the temple [porches], Do you know Me, and do you know where I am from? I have not come on My own authority and of My own accord and as self-appointed, but the One Who sent Me is true (real, genuine, steadfast); and Him you do not know! -- john 7:28
.
I know Him [Myself] because I come from His [very] presence, and it was He [personally] Who sent Me. -- john 7:29
.
Therefore they were eager to arrest Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, for His hour (time) had not yet come. -- john 7:30
.
And besides, many of the multitude believed in Him [adhered to Him, trusted in Him, relied on Him]. And they kept saying, When the Christ comes, will He do [can He be expected to do] more miracles and produce more proofs and signs than what this Man has done? -- john 7:31
.
The Pharisees learned how the people were saying these things about Him under their breath; and the chief priests and Pharisees sent attendants (guards) to arrest Him. -- john 7:32
.
Therefore Jesus said, For a little while I am [still] with you, and then I go back to Him Who sent Me. -- john 7:33
.
You will look for Me, but you will not [be able to] find Me; where I am, you cannot come. -- john 7:34
.
Then the Jews said among themselves, Where does this Man intend to go that we shall not find Him? Will He go to the Jews who are scattered in the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? -- john 7:35
.
What does this statement of His mean, You will look for Me and not be able to find Me, and, Where I am, you cannot come? -- john 7:36
.
Now on the final and most important day of the Feast, Jesus stood, and He cried in a loud voice, If any man is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink! -- john 7:37
.
He who believes in Me [who cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me] as the Scripture has said, From his innermost being shall flow [continuously] springs and rivers of living water. -- john 7:38
.
But He was speaking here of the Spirit, Whom those who believed (trusted, had faith) in Him were afterward to receive. For the [Holy] Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified (raised to honor). -- john 7:39
.
Listening to those words, some of the multitude said, This is certainly and beyond doubt the Prophet! -- john 7:40
.
Others said, This is the Christ (the Messiah, Anointed One)! But some said, What? Does the Christ come out of Galilee? -- john 7:41
.
Does not the Scripture tell us that the Christ will come from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived? -- john 7:42
.
So there arose a division and dissension among the people concerning Him. -- john 7:43
.
Some of them wanted to arrest Him, but no one [ventured and] laid hands on Him. -- john 7:44
.
Meanwhile the attendants (guards) had gone back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, Why have you not brought Him here with you? -- john 7:45
.
The attendants replied, Never has a man talked as this Man talks! [No mere man has ever spoken as He speaks!] -- john 7:46
.
The Pharisees said to them, Are you also deluded and led astray? [Are you also swept off your feet?] -- john 7:47
.
Has any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in Him? -- john 7:48
.
As for this multitude (rabble) that does not know the Law, they are contemptible and doomed and accursed! -- john 7:49
.
Then Nicodemus, who came to Jesus before at night and was one of them, asked, -- john 7:50
.
Does our Law convict a man without giving him a hearing and finding out what he has done? -- john 7:51
.
They answered him, Are you too from Galilee? Search [the Scriptures yourself], and you will see that no prophet comes (will rise to prominence) from Galilee. -- john 7:52
.
And they went [back], each to his own house. -- john 7:53
.
BUT JESUS went to the Mount of Olives. -- john 8:1
.
Early in the morning (at dawn), He came back into the temple [court], and the people came to Him in crowds. He sat down and was teaching them, -- john 8:2
.
When the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. They made her stand in the middle of the court and put the case before Him. -- john 8:3
.
Teacher, they said, This woman has been caught in the very act of adultery. -- john 8:4
.
Now Moses in the Law commanded us that such [women--offenders] shall be stoned to death. But what do You say [to do with her--what is Your sentence]? -- john 8:5
.
This they said to try (test) Him, hoping they might find a charge on which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger. -- john 8:6
.
However, when they persisted with their question, He raised Himself up and said, Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her. -- john 8:7
.
Then He bent down and went on writing on the ground with His finger. -- john 8:8
.
They listened to Him, and then they began going out, conscience-stricken, one by one, from the oldest down to the last one of them, till Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing there before Him in the center of the court. -- john 8:9
.
When Jesus raised Himself up, He said to her, Woman, where are your accusers? Has no man condemned you? -- john 8:10
.
She answered, No one, Lord! And Jesus said, I do not condemn you either. Go on your way and from now on sin no more. -- john 8:11
.
Once more Jesus addressed the crowd. He said, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me will not be walking in the dark, but will have the Light which is Life. -- john 8:12
.
Whereupon the Pharisees told Him, You are testifying on Your own behalf; Your testimony is not valid and is worthless. -- john 8:13
.
Jesus answered, Even if I do testify on My own behalf, My testimony is true and reliable and valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. -- john 8:14
.
You [set yourselves up to] judge according to the flesh (by what you see). [You condemn by external, human standards.] I do not [set Myself up to] judge or condemn or sentence anyone. -- john 8:15
.
Yet even if I do judge, My judgment is true [My decision is right]; for I am not alone [in making it], but [there are two of Us] I and the Father, Who sent Me. -- john 8:16
.
In your [own] Law it is written that the testimony (evidence) of two persons is reliable and valid. -- john 8:17
.
I am One [of the Two] bearing testimony concerning Myself; and My Father, Who sent Me, He also testifies about Me. -- john 8:18
.
Then they said to Him, Where is this Father of Yours? Jesus answered, You know My Father as little as you know Me. If you knew Me, you would know My Father also. -- john 8:19
.
Jesus said these things in the treasury while He was teaching in the temple [court]; but no one ventured to arrest Him, because His hour had not yet come. -- john 8:20
.
Therefore He said again to them, I am going away, and you will be looking for Me, and you will die in (under the curse of) your sin. Where I am going, it is not possible for you to come. -- john 8:21
.
At this the Jews began to ask among themselves, Will He kill Himself? Is that why He says, Where I am going, it is not possible for you to come? -- john 8:22
.
He said to them, You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world (of this earthly order); I am not of this world. -- john 8:23
.
That is why I told you that you will die in (under the curse of) your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He [Whom I claim to be--if you do not adhere to, trust in, and rely on Me], you will die in your sins. -- john 8:24
.
Then they said to Him, Who are You anyway? Jesus replied, [Why do I even speak to you!] I am exactly what I have been telling you from the first. -- john 8:25
.
I have much to say about you and to judge and condemn. But He Who sent Me is true (reliable), and I tell the world [only] the things that I have heard from Him. -- john 8:26
.
They did not perceive (know, understand) that He was speaking to them about the Father. -- john 8:27
.
So Jesus added, When you have lifted up the Son of Man [on the cross], you will realize (know, understand) that I am He [for Whom you look] and that I do nothing of Myself (of My own accord or on My own authority), but I say [exactly] what My Father has taught Me. -- john 8:28
.
And He Who sent Me is ever with Me; My Father has not left Me alone, for I always do what pleases Him. -- john 8:29
.
As He said these things, many believed in Him [trusted, relied on, and adhered to Him]. -- john 8:30
.
So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in Him, If you abide in My word [hold fast to My teachings and live in accordance with them], you are truly My disciples. -- john 8:31
.
And you will know the Truth, and the Truth will set you free. -- john 8:32
.
They answered Him, We are Abraham's offspring (descendants) and have never been in bondage to anybody. What do You mean by saying, You will be set free? -- john 8:33
.
Jesus answered them, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, Whoever commits and practices sin is the slave of sin. -- john 8:34
.
Now a slave does not remain in a household permanently (forever); the son [of the house] does remain forever. -- john 8:35
.
So if the Son liberates you [makes you free men], then you are really and unquestionably free. -- john 8:36
.
[Yes] I know that you are Abraham's offspring; yet you plan to kill Me, because My word has no entrance (makes no progress, does not find any place) in you. -- john 8:37
.
I tell the things which I have seen and learned at My Father's side, and your actions also reflect what you have heard and learned from your father. -- john 8:38
.
They retorted, Abraham is our father. Jesus said, If you were [truly] Abraham's children, then you would do the works of Abraham [follow his example, do as Abraham did]. -- john 8:39
.
But now [instead] you are wanting and seeking to kill Me, a Man Who has told you the truth which I have heard from God. This is not the way Abraham acted. -- john 8:40
.
You are doing the works of your [own] father. They said to Him, We are not illegitimate children and born out of fornication; we have one Father, even God. -- john 8:41
.
Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me and respect Me and welcome Me gladly, for I proceeded (came forth) from God [out of His very presence]. I did not even come on My own authority or of My own accord (as self-appointed); but He sent Me. -- john 8:42
.
Why do you misunderstand what I say? It is because you are unable to hear what I am saying. [You cannot bear to listen to My message; your ears are shut to My teaching.] -- john 8:43
.
You are of your father, the devil, and it is your will to practice the lusts and gratify the desires [which are characteristic] of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a falsehood, he speaks what is natural to him, for he is a liar [himself] and the father of lies and of all that is false. -- john 8:44
.
But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me [do not trust Me, do not rely on Me, or adhere to Me]. -- john 8:45
.
Who of you convicts Me of wrongdoing or finds Me guilty of sin? Then if I speak truth, why do you not believe Me [trust Me, rely on, and adhere to Me]? -- john 8:46
.
Whoever is of God listens to God. [Those who belong to God hear the words of God.] This is the reason that you do not listen [to those words, to Me]: because you do not belong to God and are not of God or in harmony with Him. -- john 8:47
.
The Jews answered Him, Are we not right when we say You are a Samaritan and that You have a demon [that You are under the power of an evil spirit]? -- john 8:48
.
Jesus answered, I am not possessed by a demon. On the contrary, I honor and reverence My Father and you dishonor (despise, vilify, and scorn) Me. -- john 8:49
.
However, I am not in search of honor for Myself. [I do not seek and am not aiming for My own glory.] There is One Who [looks after that; He] seeks [My glory], and He is the Judge. -- john 8:50
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, if anyone observes My teaching [lives in accordance with My message, keeps My word], he will by no means ever see and experience death. -- john 8:51
.
The Jews said to Him, Now we know that You are under the power of a demon (insane). Abraham died, and also the prophets, yet You say, If a man keeps My word, he will never taste of death into all eternity. -- john 8:52
.
Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, and all the prophets died! Who do You make Yourself out to be? -- john 8:53
.
Jesus answered, If I were to glorify Myself (magnify, praise, and honor Myself), I would have no real glory, for My glory would be nothing and worthless. [My honor must come to Me from My Father.] It is My Father Who glorifies Me [Who extols Me, magnifies, and praises Me], of Whom you say that He is your God. -- john 8:54
.
Yet you do not know Him or recognize Him and are not acquainted with Him, but I know Him. If I should say that I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I know Him and keep His word [obey His teachings, am faithful to His message]. -- john 8:55
.
Your forefather Abraham was extremely happy at the hope and prospect of seeing My day (My incarnation); and he did see it and was delighted. -- john 8:56
.
Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham? -- john 8:57
.
Jesus replied, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, before Abraham was born, I AM. -- john 8:58
.
So they took up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus, by mixing with the crowd, concealed Himself and went out of the temple [enclosure]. -- john 8:59
.
AS HE passed along, He noticed a man blind from his birth. -- john 9:1
.
His disciples asked Him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind? -- john 9:2
.
Jesus answered, It was not that this man or his parents sinned, but he was born blind in order that the workings of God should be manifested (displayed and illustrated) in him. -- john 9:3
.
We must work the works of Him Who sent Me and be busy with His business while it is daylight; night is coming on, when no man can work. -- john 9:4
.
As long as I am in the world, I am the world's Light. -- john 9:5
.
When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay (mud) with His saliva, and He spread it [as ointment] on the man's eyes. -- john 9:6
.
And He said to him, Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam--which means Sent. So he went and washed, and came back seeing. -- john 9:7
.
When the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar saw him, they said, Is not this the man who used to sit and beg? -- john 9:8
.
Some said, It is he. Others said, No, but he looks very much like him. But he said, Yes, I am the man. -- john 9:9
.
So they said to him, How were your eyes opened? -- john 9:10
.
He replied, The Man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and I obtained my sight! -- john 9:11
.
They asked him, Where is He? He said, I do not know. -- john 9:12
.
Then they conducted to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. -- john 9:13
.
Now it was on the Sabbath day that Jesus mixed the mud and opened the man's eyes. -- john 9:14
.
So now again the Pharisees asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He smeared mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see. -- john 9:15
.
Then some of the Pharisees said, This Man [Jesus] is not from God, because He does not observe the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner (a bad man) do such signs and miracles? So there was a difference of opinion among them. -- john 9:16
.
Accordingly they said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him, seeing that He opened your eyes? And he said, He is [He must be] a prophet! -- john 9:17
.
However, the Jews did not believe that he had [really] been blind and that he had received his sight until they called (summoned) the parents of the man. -- john 9:18
.
They asked them, Is this your son, whom you reported as having been born blind? How then does he see now? -- john 9:19
.
His parents answered, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind. -- john 9:20
.
But as to how he can now see, we do not know; or who has opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age. Ask him; let him speak for himself and give his own account of it. -- john 9:21
.
His parents said this because they feared [the leaders of] the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ, he should be expelled and excluded from the synagogue. -- john 9:22
.
On that account his parents said, He is of age; ask him. -- john 9:23
.
So the second time they summoned the man who had been born blind, and said to him, Now give God the glory (praise). This Fellow we know is only a sinner (a wicked person). -- john 9:24
.
Then he answered, I do not know whether He is a sinner and wicked or not. But one thing I do know, that whereas I was blind before, now I see. -- john 9:25
.
So they said to him, What did He [actually] do to you? How did He open your eyes? -- john 9:26
.
He answered, I already told you and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Can it be that you wish to become His disciples also? -- john 9:27
.
And they stormed at him [they jeered, they sneered, they reviled him] and retorted, You are His disciple yourself, but we are the disciples of Moses. -- john 9:28
.
We know for certain that God spoke with Moses, but as for this Fellow, we know nothing about where He hails from. -- john 9:29
.
The man replied, Well, this is astonishing! Here a Man has opened my eyes, and yet you do not know where He comes from. [That is amazing!] -- john 9:30
.
We know that God does not listen to sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and a worshiper of Him and does His will, He listens to him. -- john 9:31
.
Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. -- john 9:32
.
If this Man were not from God, He would not be able to do anything like this. -- john 9:33
.
They retorted, You were wholly born in sin [from head to foot]; and do you [presume to] teach us? So they cast him out [threw him clear outside the synagogue]. -- john 9:34
.
Jesus heard that they had put him out, and meeting him He said, Do you believe in and adhere to the Son of Man or the Son of God ? -- john 9:35
.
He answered, Who is He, Sir? Tell me, that I may believe in and adhere to Him. -- john 9:36
.
Jesus said to him, You have seen Him; [in fact] He is talking to you right now. -- john 9:37
.
He called out, Lord, I believe! [I rely on, I trust, I cleave to You!] And he worshiped Him. -- john 9:38
.
Then Jesus said, I came into this world for judgment [as a Separator, in order that there may be separation between those who believe on Me and those who reject Me], to make the sightless see and to make those who see become blind. -- john 9:39
.
Some Pharisees who were near, hearing this remark, said to Him, Are we also blind? -- john 9:40
.
Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin; but because you now claim to have sight, your sin remains. [If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but because you insist, We do see clearly, you are unable to escape your guilt.] -- john 9:41
.
I ASSURE you, most solemnly I tell you, he who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way (elsewhere, from some other quarter) is a thief and a robber. -- john 10:1
.
But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. -- john 10:2
.
The watchman opens the door for this man, and the sheep listen to his voice and heed it; and he calls his own sheep by name and brings (leads) them out. -- john 10:3
.
When he has brought his own sheep outside, he walks on before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. -- john 10:4
.
They will never [on any account] follow a stranger, but will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers or recognize their call. -- john 10:5
.
Jesus used this parable (illustration) with them, but they did not understand what He was talking about. -- john 10:6
.
So Jesus said again, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, that I Myself am the Door for the sheep. -- john 10:7
.
All others who came [as such] before Me are thieves and robbers, but the [true] sheep did not listen to and obey them. -- john 10:8
.
I am the Door; anyone who enters in through Me will be saved (will live). He will come in and he will go out [freely], and will find pasture. -- john 10:9
.
The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows). -- john 10:10
.
I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd risks and lays down His [own] life for the sheep. -- john 10:11
.
But the hired servant (he who merely serves for wages) who is neither the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep, when he sees the wolf coming, deserts the flock and runs away. And the wolf chases and snatches them and scatters [the flock]. -- john 10:12
.
Now the hireling flees because he merely serves for wages and is not himself concerned about the sheep [cares nothing for them]. -- john 10:13
.
I am the Good Shepherd; and I know and recognize My own, and My own know and recognize Me-- -- john 10:14
.
Even as [truly as] the Father knows Me and I also know the Father--and I am giving My [very own] life and laying it down on behalf of the sheep. -- john 10:15
.
And I have other sheep [beside these] that are not of this fold. I must bring and impel those also; and they will listen to My voice and heed My call, and so there will be [they will become] one flock under one Shepherd. -- john 10:16
.
For this [reason] the Father loves Me, because I lay down My [own] life--to take it back again. -- john 10:17
.
No one takes it away from Me. On the contrary, I lay it down voluntarily. [I put it from Myself.] I am authorized and have power to lay it down (to resign it) and I am authorized and have power to take it back again. These are the instructions (orders) which I have received [as My charge] from My Father. -- john 10:18
.
Then a fresh division of opinion arose among the Jews because of His saying these things. -- john 10:19
.
And many of them said, He has a demon and He is mad (insane--He raves, He rambles). Why do you listen to Him? -- john 10:20
.
Others argued, These are not the thoughts and the language of one possessed. Can a demon-possessed person open blind eyes? -- john 10:21
.
After this the Feast of Dedication [of the reconsecration of the temple] was taking place at Jerusalem. It was winter, -- john 10:22
.
And Jesus was walking in Solomon's Porch in the temple area. -- john 10:23
.
So the Jews surrounded Him and began asking Him, How long are You going to keep us in doubt and suspense? If You are really the Christ (the Messiah), tell us so plainly and openly. -- john 10:24
.
Jesus answered them, I have told you so, yet you do not believe Me [you do not trust Me and rely on Me]. The very works that I do by the power of My Father and in My Father's name bear witness concerning Me [they are My credentials and evidence in support of Me]. -- john 10:25
.
But you do not believe and trust and rely on Me because you do not belong to My fold [you are no sheep of Mine]. -- john 10:26
.
The sheep that are My own hear and are listening to My voice; and I know them, and they follow Me. -- john 10:27
.
And I give them eternal life, and they shall never lose it or perish throughout the ages. [To all eternity they shall never by any means be destroyed.] And no one is able to snatch them out of My hand. -- john 10:28
.
My Father, Who has given them to Me, is greater and mightier than all [else]; and no one is able to snatch [them] out of the Father's hand. -- john 10:29
.
I and the Father are One. -- john 10:30
.
Again the Jews brought up stones to stone Him. -- john 10:31
.
Jesus said to them, My Father has enabled Me to do many good deeds. [I have shown many acts of mercy in your presence.] For which of these do you mean to stone Me? -- john 10:32
.
The Jews replied, We are not going to stone You for a good act, but for blasphemy, because You, a mere Man, make Yourself [out to be] God. -- john 10:33
.
Jesus answered, Is it not written in your Law, I said, You are gods? -- john 10:34
.
So men are called gods [by the Law], men to whom God's message came--and the Scripture cannot be set aside or cancelled or broken or annulled-- -- john 10:35
.
[If that is true] do you say of the One Whom the Father consecrated and dedicated and set apart for Himself and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God? -- john 10:36
.
If I am not doing the works [performing the deeds] of My Father, then do not believe Me [do not adhere to Me and trust Me and rely on Me]. -- john 10:37
.
But if I do them, even though you do not believe Me or have faith in Me, [at least] believe the works and have faith in what I do, in order that you may know and understand [clearly] that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father [One with Him]. -- john 10:38
.
They sought again to arrest Him, but He escaped from their hands. -- john 10:39
.
He went back again across the Jordan to the locality where John was when he first baptized, and there He remained. -- john 10:40
.
And many came to Him, and they kept saying, John did not perform a [single] sign or miracle, but everything John said about this Man was true. -- john 10:41
.
And many [people] there became believers in Him. [They adhered to and trusted in and relied on Him.] -- john 10:42
.
NOW A certain man named Lazarus was ill. He was of Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. -- john 11:1
.
This Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was [now] sick. -- john 11:2
.
So the sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, he whom You love [so well] is sick. -- john 11:3
.
When Jesus received the message, He said, This sickness is not to end in death; but [on the contrary] it is to honor God and to promote His glory, that the Son of God may be glorified through (by) it. -- john 11:4
.
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. [They were His dear friends, and He held them in loving esteem.] -- john 11:5
.
Therefore [even] when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He still stayed two days longer in the same place where He was. -- john 11:6
.
Then after that interval He said to His disciples, Let us go back again to Judea. -- john 11:7
.
The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews only recently were intending and trying to stone You, and are You [thinking of] going back there again? -- john 11:8
.
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? Anyone who walks about in the daytime does not stumble, because he sees [by] the light of this world. -- john 11:9
.
But if anyone walks about in the night, he does stumble, because there is no light in him [the light is lacking to him]. -- john 11:10
.
He said these things, and then added, Our friend Lazarus is at rest and sleeping; but I am going there that I may awaken him out of his sleep. -- john 11:11
.
The disciples answered, Lord, if he is sleeping, he will recover. -- john 11:12
.
However, Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He referred to falling into a refreshing and natural sleep. -- john 11:13
.
So then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus is dead, -- john 11:14
.
And for your sake I am glad that I was not there; it will help you to believe (to trust and rely on Me). However, let us go to him. -- john 11:15
.
Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, Let us go too, that we may die [be killed] along with Him. -- john 11:16
.
So when Jesus arrived, He found that he [Lazarus] had already been in the tomb four days. -- john 11:17
.
Bethany was near Jerusalem, only about two miles away, -- john 11:18
.
And a considerable number of the Jews had gone out to see Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. -- john 11:19
.
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet Him, while Mary remained sitting in the house. -- john 11:20
.
Martha then said to Jesus, Master, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. -- john 11:21
.
And even now I know that whatever You ask from God, He will grant it to You. -- john 11:22
.
Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again. -- john 11:23
.
Martha replied, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. -- john 11:24
.
Jesus said to her, I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on) Me, although he may die, yet he shall live; -- john 11:25
.
And whoever continues to live and believes in (has faith in, cleaves to, and relies on) Me shall never [actually] die at all. Do you believe this? -- john 11:26
.
She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed [I do believe] that You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One), the Son of God, [even He] Who was to come into the world. [It is for Your coming that the world has waited.] -- john 11:27
.
After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, privately whispering to her, The Teacher is close at hand and is asking for you. -- john 11:28
.
When she heard this, she sprang up quickly and went to Him. -- john 11:29
.
Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the same spot where Martha had met Him. -- john 11:30
.
When the Jews who were sitting with her in the house and consoling her saw how hastily Mary had arisen and gone out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to pour out her grief there. -- john 11:31
.
When Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw Him, she dropped down at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. -- john 11:32
.
When Jesus saw her sobbing, and the Jews who came with her [also] sobbing, He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. [He chafed in spirit and sighed and was disturbed.] -- john 11:33
.
And He said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see. -- john 11:34
.
Jesus wept. -- john 11:35
.
The Jews said, See how [tenderly] He loved him! -- john 11:36
.
But some of them said, Could not He Who opened a blind man's eyes have prevented this man from dying? -- john 11:37
.
Now Jesus, again sighing repeatedly and deeply disquieted, approached the tomb. It was a cave (a hole in the rock), and a boulder lay against [the entrance to close] it. -- john 11:38
.
Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead man, exclaimed, But Lord, by this time he [is decaying and] throws off an offensive odor, for he has been dead four days! -- john 11:39
.
Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you and promise you that if you would believe and rely on Me, you would see the glory of God? -- john 11:40
.
So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. -- john 11:41
.
Yes, I know You always hear and listen to Me, but I have said this on account of and for the benefit of the people standing around, so that they may believe that You did send Me [that You have made Me Your Messenger]. -- john 11:42
.
When He had said this, He shouted with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out! -- john 11:43
.
And out walked the man who had been dead, his hands and feet wrapped in burial cloths (linen strips), and with a [burial] napkin bound around his face. Jesus said to them, Free him of the burial wrappings and let him go. -- john 11:44
.
Upon seeing what Jesus had done, many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed in Him. [They trusted in Him and adhered to Him and relied on Him.] -- john 11:45
.
But some of them went back to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. -- john 11:46
.
So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council (the Sanhedrin) and said, What are we to do? For this Man performs many signs (evidences, miracles). -- john 11:47
.
If we let Him alone to go on like this, everyone will believe in Him and adhere to Him, and the Romans will come and suppress and destroy and take away our [holy] place and our nation [our temple and city and our civil organization]. -- john 11:48
.
But one of them, Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year, declared, You know nothing at all! -- john 11:49
.
Nor do you understand or reason out that it is expedient and better for your own welfare that one man should die on behalf of the people than that the whole nation should perish (be destroyed, ruined). -- john 11:50
.
Now he did not say this simply of his own accord [he was not self-moved]; but being the high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation, -- john 11:51
.
And not only for the nation but also for the purpose of uniting into one body the children of God who have been scattered far and wide. -- john 11:52
.
So from that day on they took counsel and plotted together how they might put Him to death. -- john 11:53
.
For that reason Jesus no longer appeared publicly among the Jews, but left there and retired to the district that borders on the wilderness (the desert), to a village called Ephraim, and there He stayed with the disciples. -- john 11:54
.
Now the Jewish Passover was at hand, and many from the country went up to Jerusalem in order that they might purify and consecrate themselves before the Passover. -- john 11:55
.
So they kept looking for Jesus and questioned among themselves as they were standing about in the temple [area], What do you think? Will He not come to the Feast at all? -- john 11:56
.
Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it to them, so that they might arrest Him. -- john 11:57
.
SO SIX days before the Passover Feast, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had died and whom He had raised from the dead. -- john 12:1
.
So they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at the table with Him. -- john 12:2
.
Mary took a pound of ointment of pure liquid nard [a rare perfume] that was very expensive, and she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped them with her hair. And the whole house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. -- john 12:3
.
But Judas Iscariot, the one of His disciples who was about to betray Him, said, -- john 12:4
.
Why was this perfume not sold for denarii [a year's wages for an ordinary workman] and that [money] given to the poor (the destitute)? -- john 12:5
.
Now he did not say this because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief; and having the bag (the money box, the purse of the Twelve), he took for himself what was put into it [pilfering the collections]. -- john 12:6
.
But Jesus said, Let her alone. It was [intended] that she should keep it for the time of My preparation for burial. [She has kept it that she might have it for the time of My embalming.] -- john 12:7
.
You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me. -- john 12:8
.
Now a great crowd of the Jews heard that He was at Bethany, and they came there, not only because of Jesus but that they also might see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. -- john 12:9
.
So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also, -- john 12:10
.
Because on account of him many of the Jews were going away [were withdrawing from and leaving the Judeans] and believing in and adhering to Jesus. -- john 12:11
.
The next day a vast crowd of those who had come to the Passover Feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. -- john 12:12
.
So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him. And as they went, they kept shouting, Hosanna! Blessed is He and praise to Him Who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel! -- john 12:13
.
And Jesus, having found a young donkey, rode upon it, [just] as it is written in the Scriptures, -- john 12:14
.
Do not fear, O Daughter of Zion! Look! Your King is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt! -- john 12:15
.
His disciples did not understand and could not comprehend the meaning of these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified and exalted, they remembered that these things had been written about Him and had been done to Him. -- john 12:16
.
The group that had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from among the dead kept telling it [bearing witness] to others. -- john 12:17
.
It was for this reason that the crowd went out to meet Him, because they had heard that He had performed this sign (proof, miracle). -- john 12:18
.
Then the Pharisees said among themselves, You see how futile your efforts are and how you accomplish nothing. See! The whole world is running after Him! -- john 12:19
.
Now among those who went up to worship at the Feast were some Greeks. -- john 12:20
.
These came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and they made this request, Sir, we desire to see Jesus. -- john 12:21
.
Philip came and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip together [went] and told Jesus. -- john 12:22
.
And Jesus answered them, The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified and exalted. -- john 12:23
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains [just one grain; it never becomes more but lives] by itself alone. But if it dies, it produces many others and yields a rich harvest. -- john 12:24
.
Anyone who loves his life loses it, but anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal. [Whoever has no love for, no concern for, no regard for his life here on earth, but despises it, preserves his life forever and ever.] -- john 12:25
.
If anyone serves Me, he must continue to follow Me [to cleave steadfastly to Me, conform wholly to My example in living and, if need be, in dying] and wherever I am, there will My servant be also. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him. -- john 12:26
.
Now My soul is troubled and distressed, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour [of trial and agony]? But it was for this very purpose that I have come to this hour [that I might undergo it]. -- john 12:27
.
[Rather, I will say,] Father, glorify (honor and extol) Your [own] name! Then there came a voice out of heaven saying, I have already glorified it, and I will glorify it again. -- john 12:28
.
The crowd of bystanders heard the sound and said that it had thundered; others said, An angel has spoken to Him! -- john 12:29
.
Jesus answered, This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sake. -- john 12:30
.
Now the judgment (crisis) of this world is coming on [sentence is now being passed on this world]. Now the ruler (evil genius, prince) of this world shall be cast out (expelled). -- john 12:31
.
And I, if and when I am lifted up from the earth [on the cross], will draw and attract all men [Gentiles as well as Jews] to Myself. -- john 12:32
.
He said this to signify in what manner He would die. -- john 12:33
.
At this the people answered Him, We have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; how then can You say, The Son of Man must be lifted up [on the cross]? Who is this Son of Man? -- john 12:34
.
So Jesus said to them, You will have the Light only a little while longer. Walk while you have the Light [keep on living by it], so that darkness may not overtake and overcome you. He who walks about in the dark does not know where he goes [he is drifting]. -- john 12:35
.
While you have the Light, believe in the Light [have faith in it, hold to it, rely on it], that you may become sons of the Light and be filled with Light. Jesus said these things, and then He went away and hid Himself from them [was lost to their view]. -- john 12:36
.
Even though He had done so many miracles before them (right before their eyes), yet they still did not trust in Him and failed to believe in Him-- -- john 12:37
.
So that what Isaiah the prophet said was fulfilled: Lord, who has believed our report and our message? And to whom has the arm (the power) of the Lord been shown (unveiled and revealed)? -- john 12:38
.
Therefore they could not believe [they were unable to believe]. For Isaiah has also said, -- john 12:39
.
He has blinded their eyes and hardened and benumbed their [callous, degenerated] hearts [He has made their minds dull], to keep them from seeing with their eyes and understanding with their hearts and minds and repenting and turning to Me to heal them. -- john 12:40
.
Isaiah said this because he saw His glory and spoke of Him. -- john 12:41
.
And yet [in spite of all this] many even of the leading men (the authorities and the nobles) believed and trusted in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, for fear that [if they should acknowledge Him] they would be expelled from the synagogue; -- john 12:42
.
For they loved the approval and the praise and the glory that come from men [instead of and] more than the glory that comes from God. [They valued their credit with men more than their credit with God.] -- john 12:43
.
But Jesus loudly declared, The one who believes in Me does not [only] believe in and trust in and rely on Me, but [in believing in Me he believes] in Him Who sent Me. -- john 12:44
.
And whoever sees Me sees Him Who sent Me. -- john 12:45
.
I have come as a Light into the world, so that whoever believes in Me [whoever cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me] may not continue to live in darkness. -- john 12:46
.
If anyone hears My teachings and fails to observe them [does not keep them, but disregards them], it is not I who judges him. For I have not come to judge and to condemn and to pass sentence and to inflict penalty on the world, but to save the world. -- john 12:47
.
Anyone who rejects Me and persistently sets Me at naught, refusing to accept My teachings, has his judge [however]; for the [very] message that I have spoken will itself judge and convict him at the last day. -- john 12:48
.
This is because I have never spoken on My own authority or of My own accord or as self-appointed, but the Father Who sent Me has Himself given Me orders [concerning] what to say and what to tell. -- john 12:49
.
And I know that His commandment is (means) eternal life. So whatever I speak, I am saying [exactly] what My Father has told Me to say and in accordance with His instructions. -- john 12:50
.
[NOW] BEFORE the Passover Feast began, Jesus knew (was fully aware) that the time had come for Him to leave this world and return to the Father. And as He had loved those who were His own in the world, He loved them to the last and to the highest degree. -- john 13:1
.
So [it was] during supper, Satan having already put the thought of betraying Jesus in the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, -- john 13:2
.
[That] Jesus, knowing (fully aware) that the Father had put everything into His hands, and that He had come from God and was [now] returning to God, -- john 13:3
.
Got up from supper, took off His garments, and taking a [servant's] towel, He fastened it around His waist. -- john 13:4
.
Then He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the [servant's] towel with which He was girded. -- john 13:5
.
When He came to Simon Peter, [Peter] said to Him, Lord, are my feet to be washed by You? [Is it for You to wash my feet?] -- john 13:6
.
Jesus said to him, You do not understand now what I am doing, but you will understand later on. -- john 13:7
.
Peter said to Him, You shall never wash my feet! Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with (in) Me [you have no share in companionship with Me]. -- john 13:8
.
Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, [wash] not only my feet, but my hands and my head too! -- john 13:9
.
Jesus said to him, Anyone who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is clean all over. And you [My disciples] are clean, but not all of you. -- john 13:10
.
For He knew who was going to betray Him; that was the reason He said, Not all of you are clean. -- john 13:11
.
So when He had finished washing their feet and had put on His garments and had sat down again, He said to them, Do you understand what I have done to you? -- john 13:12
.
You call Me the Teacher (Master) and the Lord, and you are right in doing so, for that is what I am. -- john 13:13
.
If I then, your Lord and Teacher (Master), have washed your feet, you ought [it is your duty, you are under obligation, you owe it] to wash one another's feet. -- john 13:14
.
For I have given you this as an example, so that you should do [in your turn] what I have done to you. -- john 13:15
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, A servant is not greater than his master, and no one who is sent is superior to the one who sent him. -- john 13:16
.
If you know these things, blessed and happy and to be envied are you if you practice them [if you act accordingly and really do them]. -- john 13:17
.
I am not speaking of and I do not mean all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats My bread with Me has raised up his heel against Me. -- john 13:18
.
I tell you this now before it occurs, so that when it does take place you may be persuaded and believe that I am He [Who I say I am--the Christ, the Anointed One, the Messiah]. -- john 13:19
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, he who receives and welcomes and takes into his heart any messenger of Mine receives Me [in just that way]; and he who receives and welcomes and takes Me into his heart receives Him Who sent Me [in that same way]. -- john 13:20
.
After Jesus had said these things, He was troubled (disturbed, agitated) in spirit and said, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, one of you will deliver Me up [one of you will be false to Me and betray Me]! -- john 13:21
.
The disciples kept looking at one another, puzzled as to whom He could mean. -- john 13:22
.
One of His disciples, whom Jesus loved [whom He esteemed and delighted in], was reclining [next to Him] on Jesus' bosom. -- john 13:23
.
So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask of whom He was speaking. -- john 13:24
.
Then leaning back against Jesus' breast, he asked Him, Lord, who is it? -- john 13:25
.
Jesus answered, It is the one to whom I am going to give this morsel (bit) of food after I have dipped it. So when He had dipped the morsel of bread [into the dish], He gave it to Judas, Simon Iscariot's son. -- john 13:26
.
Then after [he had taken] the bit of food, Satan entered into and took possession of [Judas]. Jesus said to him, What you are going to do, do more swiftly than you seem to intend and make quick work of it. -- john 13:27
.
But nobody reclining at the table knew why He spoke to him or what He meant by telling him this. -- john 13:28
.
Some thought that, since Judas had the money box (the purse), Jesus was telling him, Buy what we need for the Festival, or that he should give something to the poor. -- john 13:29
.
So after receiving the bit of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night. -- john 13:30
.
When he had left, Jesus said, Now is the Son of Man glorified! [Now He has achieved His glory, His honor, His exaltation!] And God has been glorified through and in Him. -- john 13:31
.
And if God is glorified through and in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and He will glorify Him at once and not delay. -- john 13:32
.
[Dear] little children, I am to be with you only a little longer. You will look for Me and, as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: you are not able to come where I am going. -- john 13:33
.
I give you a new commandment: that you should love one another. Just as I have loved you, so you too should love one another. -- john 13:34
.
By this shall all [men] know that you are My disciples, if you love one another [if you keep on showing love among yourselves]. -- john 13:35
.
Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where are You going? Jesus answered, You are not able to follow Me now where I am going, but you shall follow Me afterwards. -- john 13:36
.
Peter said to Him, Lord, why cannot I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You. -- john 13:37
.
Jesus answered, Will you [really] lay down your life for Me? I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me [completely disown Me] three times. -- john 13:38
.
DO NOT let your hearts be troubled (distressed, agitated). You believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely on God; believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely also on Me. -- john 14:1
.
In My Father's house there are many dwelling places (homes). If it were not so, I would have told you; for I am going away to prepare a place for you. -- john 14:2
.
And when (if) I go and make ready a place for you, I will come back again and will take you to Myself, that where I am you may be also. -- john 14:3
.
And [to the place] where I am going, you know the way. -- john 14:4
.
Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You are going, so how can we know the way? -- john 14:5
.
Jesus said to him, I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father except by (through) Me. -- john 14:6
.
If you had known Me [had learned to recognize Me], you would also have known My Father. From now on, you know Him and have seen Him. -- john 14:7
.
Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father [cause us to see the Father--that is all we ask]; then we shall be satisfied. -- john 14:8
.
Jesus replied, Have I been with all of you for so long a time, and do you not recognize and know Me yet, Philip? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say then, Show us the Father? -- john 14:9
.
Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in Me? What I am telling you I do not say on My own authority and of My own accord; but the Father Who lives continually in Me does the (His) works (His own miracles, deeds of power). -- john 14:10
.
Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; or else believe Me for the sake of the [very] works themselves. [If you cannot trust Me, at least let these works that I do in My Father's name convince you.] -- john 14:11
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, if anyone steadfastly believes in Me, he will himself be able to do the things that I do; and he will do even greater things than these, because I go to the Father. -- john 14:12
.
And I will do [I Myself will grant] whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I AM], so that the Father may be glorified and extolled in (through) the Son. -- john 14:13
.
[Yes] I will grant [I Myself will do for you] whatever you shall ask in My Name [as presenting all that I AM]. -- john 14:14
.
If you [really] love Me, you will keep (obey) My commands. -- john 14:15
.
And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener, and Standby), that He may remain with you forever-- -- john 14:16
.
The Spirit of Truth, Whom the world cannot receive (welcome, take to its heart), because it does not see Him or know and recognize Him. But you know and recognize Him, for He lives with you [constantly] and will be in you. -- john 14:17
.
I will not leave you as orphans [comfortless, desolate, bereaved, forlorn, helpless]; I will come [back] to you. -- john 14:18
.
Just a little while now, and the world will not see Me any more, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also. -- john 14:19
.
At that time [when that day comes] you will know [for yourselves] that I am in My Father, and you [are] in Me, and I [am] in you. -- john 14:20
.
The person who has My commands and keeps them is the one who [really] loves Me; and whoever [really] loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I [too] will love him and will show (reveal, manifest) Myself to him. [I will let Myself be clearly seen by him and make Myself real to him.] -- john 14:21
.
Judas, not Iscariot, asked Him, Lord, how is it that You will reveal Yourself [make Yourself real] to us and not to the world? -- john 14:22
.
Jesus answered, If a person [really] loves Me, he will keep My word [obey My teaching]; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home (abode, special dwelling place) with him. -- john 14:23
.
Anyone who does not [really] love Me does not observe and obey My teaching. And the teaching which you hear and heed is not Mine, but [comes] from the Father Who sent Me. -- john 14:24
.
I have told you these things while I am still with you. -- john 14:25
.
But the Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener, Standby), the Holy Spirit, Whom the Father will send in My name [in My place, to represent Me and act on My behalf], He will teach you all things. And He will cause you to recall (will remind you of, bring to your remembrance) everything I have told you. -- john 14:26
.
Peace I leave with you; My [own] peace I now give and bequeath to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. [Stop allowing yourselves to be agitated and disturbed; and do not permit yourselves to be fearful and intimidated and cowardly and unsettled.] -- john 14:27
.
You heard Me tell you, I am going away and I am coming [back] to you. If you [really] loved Me, you would have been glad, because I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater and mightier than I am. -- john 14:28
.
And now I have told you [this] before it occurs, so that when it does take place you may believe and have faith in and rely on Me. -- john 14:29
.
I will not talk with you much more, for the prince (evil genius, ruler) of the world is coming. And he has no claim on Me. [He has nothing in common with Me; there is nothing in Me that belongs to him, and he has no power over Me.] -- john 14:30
.
But [Satan is coming and] I do as the Father has commanded Me, so that the world may know (be convinced) that I love the Father and that I do only what the Father has instructed Me to do. [I act in full agreement with His orders.] Rise, let us go away from here. -- john 14:31
.
I AM the True Vine, and My Father is the Vinedresser. -- john 15:1
.
Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [that stops bearing] He cuts away (trims off, takes away); and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit, to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit. -- john 15:2
.
You are cleansed and pruned already, because of the word which I have given you [the teachings I have discussed with you]. -- john 15:3
.
Dwell in Me, and I will dwell in you. [Live in Me, and I will live in you.] Just as no branch can bear fruit of itself without abiding in (being vitally united to) the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in Me. -- john 15:4
.
I am the Vine; you are the branches. Whoever lives in Me and I in him bears much (abundant) fruit. However, apart from Me [cut off from vital union with Me] you can do nothing. -- john 15:5
.
If a person does not dwell in Me, he is thrown out like a [broken-off] branch, and withers; such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire, and they are burned. -- john 15:6
.
If you live in Me [abide vitally united to Me] and My words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. -- john 15:7
.
When you bear (produce) much fruit, My Father is honored and glorified, and you show and prove yourselves to be true followers of Mine. -- john 15:8
.
I have loved you, [just] as the Father has loved Me; abide in My love [continue in His love with Me]. -- john 15:9
.
If you keep My commandments [if you continue to obey My instructions], you will abide in My love and live on in it, just as I have obeyed My Father's commandments and live on in His love. -- john 15:10
.
I have told you these things, that My joy and delight may be in you, and that your joy and gladness may be of full measure and complete and overflowing. -- john 15:11
.
This is My commandment: that you love one another [just] as I have loved you. -- john 15:12
.
No one has greater love [no one has shown stronger affection] than to lay down (give up) his own life for his friends. -- john 15:13
.
You are My friends if you keep on doing the things which I command you to do. -- john 15:14
.
I do not call you servants (slaves) any longer, for the servant does not know what his master is doing (working out). But I have called you My friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from My Father. [I have revealed to you everything that I have learned from Him.] -- john 15:15
.
You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and I have appointed you [I have planted you], that you might go and bear fruit and keep on bearing, and that your fruit may be lasting [that it may remain, abide], so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name [as presenting all that I AM], He may give it to you. -- john 15:16
.
This is what I command you: that you love one another. -- john 15:17
.
If the world hates you, know that it hated Me before it hated you. -- john 15:18
.
If you belonged to the world, the world would treat you with affection and would love you as its own. But because you are not of the world [no longer one with it], but I have chosen (selected) you out of the world, the world hates (detests) you. -- john 15:19
.
Remember that I told you, A servant is not greater than his master [is not superior to him]. If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word and obeyed My teachings, they will also keep and obey yours. -- john 15:20
.
But they will do all this to you [inflict all this suffering on you] because of [your bearing] My name and on My account, for they do not know or understand the One Who sent Me. -- john 15:21
.
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin [would be blameless]; but now they have no excuse for their sin. -- john 15:22
.
Whoever hates Me also hates My Father. -- john 15:23
.
If I had not done (accomplished) among them the works which no one else ever did, they would not be guilty of sin. But [the fact is] now they have both seen [these works] and have hated both Me and My Father. -- john 15:24
.
But [this is so] that the word written in their Law might be fulfilled, They hated Me without a cause. -- john 15:25
.
But when the Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, Strengthener, Standby) comes, Whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth Who comes (proceeds) from the Father, He [Himself] will testify regarding Me. -- john 15:26
.
But you also will testify and be My witnesses, because you have been with Me from the beginning. -- john 15:27
.
I HAVE told you all these things, so that you should not be offended (taken unawares and falter, or be caused to stumble and fall away). [I told you to keep you from being scandalized and repelled.] -- john 16:1
.
They will put you out of (expel you from) the synagogues; but an hour is coming when whoever kills you will think and claim that he has offered service to God. -- john 16:2
.
And they will do this because they have not known the Father or Me. -- john 16:3
.
But I have told you these things now, so that when they occur you will remember that I told you of them. I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. -- john 16:4
.
But now I am going to Him Who sent Me, yet none of you asks Me, Where are You going? -- john 16:5
.
But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts [taken complete possession of them]. -- john 16:6
.
However, I am telling you nothing but the truth when I say it is profitable (good, expedient, advantageous) for you that I go away. Because if I do not go away, the Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, Strengthener, Standby) will not come to you [into close fellowship with you]; but if I go away, I will send Him to you [to be in close fellowship with you]. -- john 16:7
.
And when He comes, He will convict and convince the world and bring demonstration to it about sin and about righteousness (uprightness of heart and right standing with God) and about judgment: -- john 16:8
.
About sin, because they do not believe in Me [trust in, rely on, and adhere to Me]; -- john 16:9
.
About righteousness (uprightness of heart and right standing with God), because I go to My Father, and you will see Me no longer; -- john 16:10
.
About judgment, because the ruler (evil genius, prince) of this world [Satan] is judged and condemned and sentence already is passed upon him. -- john 16:11
.
I have still many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them or to take them upon you or to grasp them now. -- john 16:12
.
But when He, the Spirit of Truth (the Truth-giving Spirit) comes, He will guide you into all the Truth (the whole, full Truth). For He will not speak His own message [on His own authority]; but He will tell whatever He hears [from the Father; He will give the message that has been given to Him], and He will announce and declare to you the things that are to come [that will happen in the future]. -- john 16:13
.
He will honor and glorify Me, because He will take of (receive, draw upon) what is Mine and will reveal (declare, disclose, transmit) it to you. -- john 16:14
.
Everything that the Father has is Mine. That is what I meant when I said that He [the Spirit] will take the things that are Mine and will reveal (declare, disclose, transmit) it to you. -- john 16:15
.
In a little while you will no longer see Me, and again after a short while you will see Me. -- john 16:16
.
So some of His disciples questioned among themselves, What does He mean when He tells us, In a little while you will no longer see Me, and again after a short while you will see Me, and, Because I go to My Father? -- john 16:17
.
What does He mean by a little while? We do not know or understand what He is talking about. -- john 16:18
.
Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him, so He said to them, Are you wondering and inquiring among yourselves what I meant when I said, In a little while you will no longer see Me, and again after a short while you will see Me? -- john 16:19
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, that you shall weep and grieve, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. -- john 16:20
.
A woman, when she gives birth to a child, has grief (anguish, agony) because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she no longer remembers her pain (trouble, anguish) because she is so glad that a man (a child, a human being) has been born into the world. -- john 16:21
.
So for the present you are also in sorrow (in distress and depressed); but I will see you again and [then] your hearts will rejoice, and no one can take from you your joy (gladness, delight). -- john 16:22
.
And when that time comes, you will ask nothing of Me [you will need to ask Me no questions]. I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, that My Father will grant you whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I AM]. -- john 16:23
.
Up to this time you have not asked a [single] thing in My Name [as presenting all that I AM]; but now ask and keep on asking and you will receive, so that your joy (gladness, delight) may be full and complete. -- john 16:24
.
I have told you these things in parables (veiled language, allegories, dark sayings); the hour is now coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I shall tell you about the Father in plain words and openly (without reserve). -- john 16:25
.
At that time you will ask (pray) in My Name; and I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf [for it will be unnecessary]. -- john 16:26
.
For the Father Himself [tenderly] loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from the Father. -- john 16:27
.
I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father. -- john 16:28
.
His disciples said, Ah, now You are speaking plainly to us and not in parables (veiled language and figures of speech)! -- john 16:29
.
Now we know that You are acquainted with everything and have no need to be asked questions. Because of this we believe that you [really] came from God. -- john 16:30
.
Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? [Do you believe it at last?] -- john 16:31
.
But take notice, the hour is coming, and it has arrived, when you will all be dispersed and scattered, every man to his own home, leaving Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. -- john 16:32
.
I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace and confidence. In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and frustration; but be of good cheer [take courage; be confident, certain, undaunted]! For I have overcome the world. [I have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you.] -- john 16:33
.
WHEN JESUS had spoken these things, He lifted up His eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify and exalt and honor and magnify Your Son, so that Your Son may glorify and extol and honor and magnify You. -- john 17:1
.
[Just as] You have granted Him power and authority over all flesh (all humankind), [now glorify Him] so that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him. -- john 17:2
.
And this is eternal life: [it means] to know (to perceive, recognize, become acquainted with, and understand) You, the only true and real God, and [likewise] to know Him, Jesus [as the] Christ (the Anointed One, the Messiah), Whom You have sent. -- john 17:3
.
I have glorified You down here on the earth by completing the work that You gave Me to do. -- john 17:4
.
And now, Father, glorify Me along with Yourself and restore Me to such majesty and honor in Your presence as I had with You before the world existed. -- john 17:5
.
I have manifested Your Name [I have revealed Your very Self, Your real Self] to the people whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have obeyed and kept Your word. -- john 17:6
.
Now [at last] they know and understand that all You have given Me belongs to You [is really and truly Yours]. -- john 17:7
.
For the [uttered] words that You gave Me I have given them; and they have received and accepted [them] and have come to know positively and in reality [to believe with absolute assurance] that I came forth from Your presence, and they have believed and are convinced that You did send Me. -- john 17:8
.
I am praying for them. I am not praying (requesting) for the world, but for those You have given Me, for they belong to You. -- john 17:9
.
All [things that are] Mine are Yours, and all [things that are] Yours belong to Me; and I am glorified in (through) them. [They have done Me honor; in them My glory is achieved.] -- john 17:10
.
And [now] I am no more in the world, but these are [still] in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep in Your Name [in the knowledge of Yourself] those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We [are one]. -- john 17:11
.
While I was with them, I kept and preserved them in Your Name [in the knowledge and worship of You]. Those You have given Me I guarded and protected, and not one of them has perished or is lost except the son of perdition [Judas Iscariot--the one who is now doomed to destruction, destined to be lost], that the Scripture might be fulfilled. -- john 17:12
.
And now I am coming to You; I say these things while I am still in the world, so that My joy may be made full and complete and perfect in them [that they may experience My delight fulfilled in them, that My enjoyment may be perfected in their own souls, that they may have My gladness within them, filling their hearts]. -- john 17:13
.
I have given and delivered to them Your word (message) and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world [do not belong to the world], just as I am not of the world. -- john 17:14
.
I do not ask that You will take them out of the world, but that You will keep and protect them from the evil one. -- john 17:15
.
They are not of the world (worldly, belonging to the world), [just] as I am not of the world. -- john 17:16
.
Sanctify them [purify, consecrate, separate them for Yourself, make them holy] by the Truth; Your Word is Truth. -- john 17:17
.
Just as You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. -- john 17:18
.
And so for their sake and on their behalf I sanctify (dedicate, consecrate) Myself, that they also may be sanctified (dedicated, consecrated, made holy) in the Truth. -- john 17:19
.
Neither for these alone do I pray [it is not for their sake only that I make this request], but also for all those who will ever come to believe in (trust in, cling to, rely on) Me through their word and teaching, -- john 17:20
.
That they all may be one, [just] as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe and be convinced that You have sent Me. -- john 17:21
.
I have given to them the glory and honor which You have given Me, that they may be one [even] as We are one: -- john 17:22
.
I in them and You in Me, in order that they may become one and perfectly united, that the world may know and [definitely] recognize that You sent Me and that You have loved them [even] as You have loved Me. -- john 17:23
.
Father, I desire that they also whom You have entrusted to Me [as Your gift to Me] may be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory, which You have given Me [Your love gift to Me]; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. -- john 17:24
.
O just and righteous Father, although the world has not known You and has failed to recognize You and has never acknowledged You, I have known You [continually]; and these men understand and know that You have sent Me. -- john 17:25
.
I have made Your Name known to them and revealed Your character and Your very Self, and I will continue to make [You] known, that the love which You have bestowed upon Me may be in them [felt in their hearts] and that I [Myself] may be in them. -- john 17:26
.
HAVING SAID these things, Jesus went out with His disciples beyond (across) the winter torrent of the Kidron [in the ravine]. There was a garden there, which He and His disciples entered. -- john 18:1
.
And Judas, who was betraying Him and delivering Him up, also knew the place, because Jesus had often retired there with His disciples. -- john 18:2
.
So Judas, obtaining and taking charge of the band of soldiers and some guards (attendants) of the high priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. -- john 18:3
.
Then Jesus, knowing all that was about to befall Him, went out to them and said, Whom are you seeking? [Whom do you want?] -- john 18:4
.
They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said to them, I am He. Judas, who was betraying Him, was also standing with them. -- john 18:5
.
When Jesus said to them, I am He, they went backwards (drew back, lurched backward) and fell to the ground. -- john 18:6
.
Then again He asked them, Whom are you seeking? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene. -- john 18:7
.
Jesus answered, I told you that I am He. So, if you want Me [if it is only I for Whom you are looking], let these men go their way. -- john 18:8
.
Thus what He had said was fulfilled and verified, Of those whom You have given Me, I have not lost even one. -- john 18:9
.
Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. -- john 18:10
.
Therefore, Jesus said to Peter, Put the sword [back] into the sheath! The cup which My Father has given Me, shall I not drink it? -- john 18:11
.
So the troops and their captain and the guards (attendants) of the Jews seized Jesus and bound Him, -- john 18:12
.
And they brought Him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year. -- john 18:13
.
It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was expedient and for their welfare that one man should die for (instead of, in behalf of) the people. -- john 18:14
.
Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and so he entered along with Jesus into the court of the palace of the high priest; -- john 18:15
.
But Peter was standing outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door and brought Peter inside. -- john 18:16
.
Then the maid who was in charge at the door said to Peter, You are not also one of the disciples of this Man, are you? He said, I am not! -- john 18:17
.
Now the servants and the guards (the attendants) had made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. And Peter was with them, standing and warming himself. -- john 18:18
.
Then the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching. -- john 18:19
.
Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue and in the temple [area], where the Jews [habitually] congregate (assemble); and I have spoken nothing secretly. -- john 18:20
.
Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard [Me] what I said to them. See! They know what I said. -- john 18:21
.
But when He said this, one of the attendants who stood by struck Jesus, saying, Is that how You answer the high priest? -- john 18:22
.
Jesus replied, If I have said anything wrong [if I have spoken abusively, if there was evil in what I said] tell what was wrong with it. But if I spoke rightly and properly, why do you strike Me? -- john 18:23
.
Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. -- john 18:24
.
But Simon Peter [still] was standing and was warming himself. They said to him, You are not also one of His disciples, are you? He denied it and said, I am not! -- john 18:25
.
One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with Him? -- john 18:26
.
And again Peter denied it. And immediately a rooster crowed. -- john 18:27
.
Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium (judgment hall, governor's palace). And it was early. They themselves did not enter the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled (become ceremonially unclean), but might be fit to eat the Passover [supper]. -- john 18:28
.
So Pilate went out to them and said, What accusation do you bring against this Man? -- john 18:29
.
They retorted, If He were not an evildoer (criminal), we would not have handed Him over to you. -- john 18:30
.
Pilate said to them, Take Him yourselves and judge and sentence and punish Him according to your [own] law. The Jews answered, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death. -- john 18:31
.
This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to show (indicate, predict) by what manner of death He was to die. -- john 18:32
.
So Pilate went back again into the judgment hall and called Jesus and asked Him, Are You the King of the Jews? -- john 18:33
.
Jesus replied, Are you saying this of yourself [on your own initiative], or have others told you about Me? -- john 18:34
.
Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your [own] people and nation and their chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done? -- john 18:35
.
Jesus answered, My kingdom (kingship, royal power) belongs not to this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My followers would have been fighting to keep Me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, My kingdom is not from here (this world); [it has no such origin or source]. -- john 18:36
.
Pilate said to Him, Then You are a King? Jesus answered, You say it! [You speak correctly!] For I am a King. [Certainly I am a King!] This is why I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the Truth. Everyone who is of the Truth [who is a friend of the Truth, who belongs to the Truth] hears and listens to My voice. -- john 18:37
.
Pilate said to Him, What is Truth? On saying this he went out to the Jews again and told them, I find no fault in Him. -- john 18:38
.
But it is your custom that I release one [prisoner] for you at the Passover. So shall I release for you the King of the Jews? -- john 18:39
.
Then they all shouted back again, Not Him [not this Man], but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber. -- john 18:40
.
SO THEN Pilate took Jesus and scourged (flogged, whipped) Him. -- john 19:1
.
And the soldiers, having twisted together a crown of thorns, put it on His head, and threw a purple cloak around Him. -- john 19:2
.
And they kept coming to Him and saying, Hail, King of the Jews! [Good health to you! Peace to you! Long life to you, King of the Jews!] And they struck Him with the palms of their hands. -- john 19:3
.
Then Pilate went out again and said to them, See, I bring Him out to you, so that you may know that I find no fault (crime, cause for accusation) in Him. -- john 19:4
.
So Jesus came out wearing the thorny crown and purple cloak, and Pilate said to them, See, [here is] the Man! -- john 19:5
.
When the chief priests and attendants (guards) saw Him, they cried out, Crucify Him! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no fault (crime) in Him. -- john 19:6
.
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to that law He should die, because He has claimed and made Himself out to be the Son of God. -- john 19:7
.
So, when Pilate heard this said, he was more alarmed and awestricken and afraid than before. -- john 19:8
.
He went into the judgment hall again and said to Jesus, Where are You from? [To what world do You belong?] But Jesus did not answer him. -- john 19:9
.
So Pilate said to Him, Will You not speak [even] to me? Do You not know that I have power (authority) to release You and I have power to crucify You? -- john 19:10
.
Jesus answered, You would not have any power or authority whatsoever against (over) Me if it were not given you from above. For this reason the sin and guilt of the one who delivered Me over to you is greater. -- john 19:11
.
Upon this, Pilate wanted (sought, was anxious) to release Him, but the Jews kept shrieking, If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar! Anybody who makes himself [out to be] a king sets himself up against Caesar [is a rebel against the emperor]! -- john 19:12
.
Hearing this, Pilate brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement [the Mosaic Pavement, the Stone Platform]--in Hebrew, Gabbatha. -- john 19:13
.
Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, and it was about the sixth hour (about twelve o'clock noon). He said to the Jews, See, [here is] your King! -- john 19:14
.
But they shouted, Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar! -- john 19:15
.
Then he delivered Him over to them to be crucified. -- john 19:16
.
And they took Jesus and led [Him] away; so He went out, bearing His own cross, to the spot called The Place of the Skull--in Hebrew it is called Golgotha. -- john 19:17
.
There they crucified Him, and with Him two others--one on either side and Jesus between them. -- john 19:18
.
And Pilate also wrote a title (an inscription on a placard) and put it on the cross. And the writing was: Jesus the Nazarene, the King of the Jews. -- john 19:19
.
And many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, [and] in Greek. -- john 19:20
.
Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am King of the Jews. -- john 19:21
.
Pilate replied, What I have written, I have written. -- john 19:22
.
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, one share for each soldier, and also the tunic (the long shirtlike undergarment). But the tunic was seamless, woven [in one piece] from the top throughout. -- john 19:23
.
So they said to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots to decide whose it shall be. This was to fulfill the Scripture, They parted My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots. So the soldiers did these things. -- john 19:24
.
But by the cross of Jesus stood His mother, His mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. -- john 19:25
.
So Jesus, seeing His mother there, and the disciple whom He loved standing near, said to His mother, [Dear] woman, See, [here is] your son! -- john 19:26
.
Then He said to the disciple, See, [here is] your mother! And from that hour, the disciple took her into his own [keeping, own home]. -- john 19:27
.
After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished (ended), said in fulfillment of the Scripture, I thirst. -- john 19:28
.
A vessel (jar) full of sour wine (vinegar) was placed there, so they put a sponge soaked in the sour wine on [a stalk, reed of] hyssop, and held it to [His] mouth. -- john 19:29
.
When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit. -- john 19:30
.
Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from hanging on the cross on the Sabbath--for that Sabbath was a very solemn and important one--the Jews requested Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away. -- john 19:31
.
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first one, and of the other who had been crucified with Him. -- john 19:32
.
But when they came to Jesus and they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. -- john 19:33
.
But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came (flowed) out. -- john 19:34
.
And he who saw it (the eyewitness) gives this evidence, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe also. -- john 19:35
.
For these things took place, that the Scripture might be fulfilled (verified, carried out), Not one of His bones shall be broken; -- john 19:36
.
And again another Scripture says, They shall look on Him Whom they have pierced. -- john 19:37
.
And after this, Joseph of Arimathea--a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews--asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate granted him permission. So he came and took away His body. -- john 19:38
.
And Nicodemus also, who first had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, [weighing] about a hundred pounds. -- john 19:39
.
So they took Jesus' body and bound it in linen cloths with the spices (aromatics), as is the Jews' customary way to prepare for burial. -- john 19:40
.
Now there was a garden in the place where He was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever [yet] been laid. -- john 19:41
.
So there, because of the Jewish day of Preparation [and] since the tomb was near by, they laid Jesus. -- john 19:42
.
NOW ON the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been removed from (lifted out of the groove across the entrance of) the tomb. -- john 20:1
.
So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus [tenderly] loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him! -- john 20:2
.
Upon this, Peter and the other disciple came out and they went toward the tomb. -- john 20:3
.
And they came running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first. -- john 20:4
.
And stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not enter. -- john 20:5
.
Then Simon Peter came up, following him, and went into the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there; -- john 20:6
.
But the burial napkin (kerchief) which had been around Jesus' head, was not lying with the other linen cloths, but was [still] rolled up (wrapped round and round) in a place by itself. -- john 20:7
.
Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went in too; and he saw and was convinced and believed. -- john 20:8
.
For as yet they did not know (understand) the statement of Scripture that He must rise again from the dead. -- john 20:9
.
Then the disciples went back again to their homes (lodging places). -- john 20:10
.
But Mary remained standing outside the tomb sobbing. As she wept, she stooped down [and looked] into the tomb. -- john 20:11
.
And she saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. -- john 20:12
.
And they said to her, Woman, why are you sobbing? She told them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him. -- john 20:13
.
On saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing [there], but she did not know (recognize) that it was Jesus. -- john 20:14
.
Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you crying [so]? For Whom are you looking? Supposing that it was the gardener, she replied, Sir, if you carried Him away from here, tell me where you have put Him and I will take Him away. -- john 20:15
.
Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning around she said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni!--which means Teacher or Master. -- john 20:16
.
Jesus said to her, Do not cling to Me [do not hold Me], for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to My brethren and tell them, I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God. -- john 20:17
.
Away came Mary Magdalene, bringing the disciples news (word) that she had seen the Lord and that He had said these things to her. -- john 20:18
.
Then on that same first day of the week, when it was evening, though the disciples were behind closed doors for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, Peace to you! -- john 20:19
.
So saying, He showed them His hands and His side. And when the disciples saw the Lord, they were filled with joy (delight, exultation, ecstasy, rapture). -- john 20:20
.
Then Jesus said to them again, Peace to you! [Just] as the Father has sent Me forth, so I am sending you. -- john 20:21
.
And having said this, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit! -- john 20:22
.
[Now having received the Holy Spirit, and being led and directed by Him] if you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of anyone, they are retained. -- john 20:23
.
But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. -- john 20:24
.
So the other disciples kept telling him, We have seen the Lord! But he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the marks made by the nails and put my finger into the nail prints, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe [it]. -- john 20:25
.
Eight days later His disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though they were behind closed doors, and stood among them and said, Peace to you! -- john 20:26
.
Then He said to Thomas, Reach out your finger here, and see My hands; and put out your hand and place [it] in My side. Do not be faithless and incredulous, but [stop your unbelief and] believe! -- john 20:27
.
Thomas answered Him, My Lord and my God! -- john 20:28
.
Jesus said to him, Because you have seen Me, Thomas, do you now believe (trust, have faith)? Blessed and happy and to be envied are those who have never seen Me and yet have believed and adhered to and trusted and relied on Me. -- john 20:29
.
There are also many other signs and miracles which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book. -- john 20:30
.
But these are written (recorded) in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ (the Anointed One), the Son of God, and that through believing and cleaving to and trusting and relying upon Him you may have life through (in) His name [through Who He is]. -- john 20:31
.
AFTER THIS, Jesus let Himself be seen and revealed [Himself] again to the disciples, at the Sea of Tiberias. And He did it in this way: -- john 21:1
.
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas, called the Twin, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, also the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples. -- john 21:2
.
Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing! They said to him, And we are coming with you! So they went out and got into the boat, and throughout that night they caught nothing. -- john 21:3
.
Morning was already breaking when Jesus came to the beach and stood there. However, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. -- john 21:4
.
So Jesus said to them, Boys (children), you do not have any meat (fish), do you? [Have you caught anything to eat along with your bread?] They answered Him, No! -- john 21:5
.
And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find [some]. So they cast the net, and now they were not able to haul it in for such a big catch (mass, quantity) of fish [was in it]. -- john 21:6
.
Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! Simon Peter, hearing him say that it was the Lord, put (girded) on his upper garment (his fisherman's coat, his outer tunic)--for he was stripped [for work]--and sprang into the sea. -- john 21:7
.
And the other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from shore, only some hundred yards away, dragging the net full of fish. -- john 21:8
.
When they got out on land (the beach), they saw a fire of coals there and fish lying on it [cooking], and bread. -- john 21:9
.
Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have just caught. -- john 21:10
.
So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to land, full of large fish, of them; and [though] there were so many of them, the net was not torn. -- john 21:11
.
Jesus said to them, Come [and] have breakfast. But none of the disciples ventured or dared to ask Him, Who are You? because they [well] knew that it was the Lord. -- john 21:12
.
Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so also [with] the fish. -- john 21:13
.
This was now the third time that Jesus revealed Himself (appeared, was manifest) to the disciples after He had risen from the dead. -- john 21:14
.
When they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these [others do--with reasoning, intentional, spiritual devotion, as one loves the Father]? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You [that I have deep, instinctive, personal affection for You, as for a close friend]. He said to him, Feed My lambs. -- john 21:15
.
Again He said to him the second time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me [with reasoning, intentional, spiritual devotion, as one loves the Father]? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You [that I have a deep, instinctive, personal affection for You, as for a close friend]. He said to him, Shepherd (tend) My sheep. -- john 21:16
.
He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me [with a deep, instinctive, personal affection for Me, as for a close friend]? Peter was grieved (was saddened and hurt) that He should ask him the third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know everything; You know that I love You [that I have a deep, instinctive, personal affection for You, as for a close friend]. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep. -- john 21:17
.
I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, when you were young you girded yourself [put on your own belt or girdle] and you walked about wherever you pleased to go. But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will put a girdle around you and carry you where you do not wish to go. -- john 21:18
.
He said this to indicate by what kind of death Peter would glorify God. And after this, He said to him, Follow Me! -- john 21:19
.
But Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, following--the one who also had leaned back on His breast at the supper and had said, Lord, who is it that is going to betray You? -- john 21:20
.
When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man? -- john 21:21
.
Jesus said to him, If I want him to stay (survive, live) until I come, what is that to you? [What concern is it of yours?] You follow Me! -- john 21:22
.
So word went out among the brethren that this disciple was not going to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die, but, If I want him to stay (survive, live) till I come, what is that to you? -- john 21:23
.
It is this same disciple who is bearing witness to these things and who has recorded (written) them; and we [well] know that his testimony is true. -- john 21:24
.
And there are also many other things which Jesus did. If they should be all recorded one by one [in detail], I suppose that even the world itself could not contain (have room for) the books that would be written. -- john 21:25
.
IN THE former account [which I prepared], O Theophilus, I made [a continuous report] dealing with all the things which Jesus began to do and to teach -- acts 1:1
.
Until the day when He ascended, after He through the Holy Spirit had instructed and commanded the apostles (special messengers) whom He had chosen. -- acts 1:2
.
To them also He showed Himself alive after His passion (His suffering in the garden and on the cross) by [a series of] many convincing demonstrations [unquestionable evidences and infallible proofs], appearing to them during forty days and talking [to them] about the things of the kingdom of God. -- acts 1:3
.
And while being in their company and eating with them, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for what the Father had promised, Of which [He said] you have heard Me speak. -- acts 1:4
.
For John baptized with water, but not many days from now you shall be baptized with (placed in, introduced into) the Holy Spirit. -- acts 1:5
.
So when they were assembled, they asked Him, Lord, is this the time when You will reestablish the kingdom and restore it to Israel? -- acts 1:6
.
He said to them, It is not for you to become acquainted with and know what time brings [the things and events of time and their definite periods] or fixed years and seasons (their critical niche in time), which the Father has appointed (fixed and reserved) by His own choice and authority and personal power. -- acts 1:7
.
But you shall receive power (ability, efficiency, and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and to the ends (the very bounds) of the earth. -- acts 1:8
.
And when He had said this, even as they were looking [at Him], He was caught up, and a cloud received and carried Him away out of their sight. -- acts 1:9
.
And while they were gazing intently into heaven as He went, behold, two men [dressed] in white robes suddenly stood beside them, -- acts 1:10
.
Who said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, Who was caught away and lifted up from among you into heaven, will return in [just] the same way in which you saw Him go into heaven. -- acts 1:11
.
Then [the disciples] went back to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, [only] a Sabbath day's journey (three-quarters of a mile) away. -- acts 1:12
.
And when they had entered [the city], they mounted [the stairs] to the upper room where they were [indefinitely] staying--Peter and John and James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas [son] of James. -- acts 1:13
.
All of these with their minds in full agreement devoted themselves steadfastly to prayer, [waiting together] with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. -- acts 1:14
.
Now on one of those days Peter arose among the brethren, the whole number of whom gathered together was about a hundred and twenty. -- acts 1:15
.
Brethren, he said, it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit foretold by the lips of David, about Judas who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus. -- acts 1:16
.
For he was counted among us and received [by divine allotment] his portion in this ministry. -- acts 1:17
.
Now this man obtained a piece of land with the [money paid him as a] reward for his treachery and wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle [of his body] and all his intestines poured forth. -- acts 1:18
.
And all the residents of Jerusalem became acquainted with the facts, so that they called the piece of land in their own dialect--Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood. -- acts 1:19
.
For in the book of Psalms it is written, Let his place of residence become deserted and gloomy, and let there be no one to live in it; and [again], Let another take his position or overseership. -- acts 1:20
.
So one of the [other] men who have accompanied us [apostles] during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, -- acts 1:21
.
From the baptism of John at the outset until the day when He was taken up from among us--one of these men must join with us and become a witness to testify to His resurrection. -- acts 1:22
.
And they accordingly proposed (nominated) two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. -- acts 1:23
.
And they prayed and said, You, Lord, Who know all hearts (their thoughts, passions, desires, appetites, purposes, and endeavors), indicate to us which one of these two You have chosen -- acts 1:24
.
To take the place in this ministry and receive the position of an apostle, from which Judas fell away and went astray to go [where he belonged] to his own [proper] place. -- acts 1:25
.
And they drew lots [between the two], and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to and counted with the eleven apostles (special messengers). -- acts 1:26
.
AND WHEN the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all assembled together in one place, -- acts 2:1
.
When suddenly there came a sound from heaven like the rushing of a violent tempest blast, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting. -- acts 2:2
.
And there appeared to them tongues resembling fire, which were separated and distributed and which settled on each one of them. -- acts 2:3
.
And they were all filled (diffused throughout their souls) with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other (different, foreign) languages (tongues), as the Spirit kept giving them clear and loud expression [in each tongue in appropriate words]. -- acts 2:4
.
Now there were then residing in Jerusalem Jews, devout and God-fearing men from every country under heaven. -- acts 2:5
.
And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together and they were astonished and bewildered, because each one heard them [the apostles] speaking in his own [particular] dialect. -- acts 2:6
.
And they were beside themselves with amazement, saying, Are not all these who are talking Galileans? -- acts 2:7
.
Then how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own (particular) dialect to which we were born? -- acts 2:8
.
Parthians and Medes and Elamites and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and [the province of] Asia, -- acts 2:9
.
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and the transient residents from Rome, both Jews and the proselytes [to Judaism from other religions], -- acts 2:10
.
Cretans and Arabians too--we all hear them speaking in our own native tongues [and telling of] the mighty works of God! -- acts 2:11
.
And all were beside themselves with amazement and were puzzled and bewildered, saying one to another, What can this mean? -- acts 2:12
.
But others made a joke of it and derisively said, They are simply drunk and full of sweet [intoxicating] wine. -- acts 2:13
.
But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: You Jews and all you residents of Jerusalem, let this be [explained] to you so that you will know and understand; listen closely to what I have to say. -- acts 2:14
.
For these men are not drunk, as you imagine, for it is [only] the third hour (about 9:a.m.) of the day; -- acts 2:15
.
But [instead] this is [the beginning of] what was spoken through the prophet Joel: -- acts 2:16
.
And it shall come to pass in the last days, God declares, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all mankind, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy [telling forth the divine counsels] and your young men shall see visions (divinely granted appearances), and your old men shall dream [divinely suggested] dreams. -- acts 2:17
.
Yes, and on My menservants also and on My maidservants in those days I will pour out of My Spirit, and they shall prophesy [telling forth the divine counsels and predicting future events pertaining especially to God's kingdom]. -- acts 2:18
.
And I will show wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth beneath, blood and fire and smoking vapor; -- acts 2:19
.
The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the obvious day of the Lord comes--that great and notable and conspicuous and renowned [day]. -- acts 2:20
.
And it shall be that whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord [invoking, adoring, and worshiping the Lord--Christ] shall be saved. -- acts 2:21
.
You men of Israel, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man accredited and pointed out and shown forth and commended and attested to you by God by the mighty works and [the power of performing] wonders and signs which God worked through Him [right] in your midst, as you yourselves know-- -- acts 2:22
.
This Jesus, when delivered up according to the definite and fixed purpose and settled plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and put out of the way [killing Him] by the hands of lawless and wicked men. -- acts 2:23
.
[But] God raised Him up, liberating Him from the pangs of death, seeing that it was not possible for Him to continue to be controlled or retained by it. -- acts 2:24
.
For David says in regard to Him, I saw the Lord constantly before me, for He is at my right hand that I may not be shaken or overthrown or cast down [from my secure and happy state]. -- acts 2:25
.
Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted exceedingly; moreover, my flesh also will dwell in hope [will encamp, pitch its tent, and dwell in hope in anticipation of the resurrection]. -- acts 2:26
.
For You will not abandon my soul, leaving it helpless in Hades (the state of departed spirits), nor let Your Holy One know decay or see destruction [of the body after death]. -- acts 2:27
.
You have made known to me the ways of life; You will enrapture me [diffusing my soul with joy] with and in Your presence. -- acts 2:28
.
Brethren, it is permitted me to tell you confidently and with freedom concerning the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. -- acts 2:29
.
Being however a prophet, and knowing that God had sealed to him with an oath that He would set one of his descendants on his throne, [II Sam. 7:12-16; Ps. 132:11.] -- acts 2:30
.
He, foreseeing this, spoke [by foreknowledge] of the resurrection of the Christ (the Messiah) that He was not deserted [in death] and left in Hades (the state of departed spirits), nor did His body know decay or see destruction. -- acts 2:31
.
This Jesus God raised up, and of that all we [His disciples] are witnesses. -- acts 2:32
.
Being therefore lifted high by and to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promised [blessing which is the] Holy Spirit, He has made this outpouring which you yourselves both see and hear. -- acts 2:33
.
For David did not ascend into the heavens; yet he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand and share My throne -- acts 2:34
.
Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet. -- acts 2:35
.
Therefore let the whole house of Israel recognize beyond all doubt and acknowledge assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ (the Messiah)--this Jesus Whom you crucified. -- acts 2:36
.
Now when they heard this they were stung (cut) to the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles (special messengers), Brethren, what shall we do? -- acts 2:37
.
And Peter answered them, Repent (change your views and purpose to accept the will of God in your inner selves instead of rejecting it) and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of and release from your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. -- acts 2:38
.
For the promise [of the Holy Spirit] is to and for you and your children, and to and for all that are far away, [even] to and for as many as the Lord our God invites and bids to come to Himself. -- acts 2:39
.
And [Peter] solemnly and earnestly witnessed (testified) and admonished (exhorted) with much more continuous speaking and warned (reproved, advised, encouraged) them, saying, Be saved from this crooked (perverse, wicked, unjust) generation. -- acts 2:40
.
Therefore those who accepted and welcomed his message were baptized, and there were added that day about 3,souls. -- acts 2:41
.
And they steadfastly persevered, devoting themselves constantly to the instruction and fellowship of the apostles, to the breaking of bread [including the Lord's Supper] and prayers. -- acts 2:42
.
And a sense of awe (reverential fear) came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were performed through the apostles (the special messengers). -- acts 2:43
.
And all who believed (who adhered to and trusted in and relied on Jesus Christ) were united and [together] they had everything in common; -- acts 2:44
.
And they sold their possessions (both their landed property and their movable goods) and distributed the price among all, according as any had need. -- acts 2:45
.
And day after day they regularly assembled in the temple with united purpose, and in their homes they broke bread [including the Lord's Supper]. They partook of their food with gladness and simplicity and generous hearts, -- acts 2:46
.
Constantly praising God and being in favor and goodwill with all the people; and the Lord kept adding [to their number] daily those who were being saved [from spiritual death]. -- acts 2:47
.
NOW PETER and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour (three o'clock in the afternoon), -- acts 3:1
.
[When] a certain man crippled from his birth was being carried along, who was laid each day at that gate of the temple [which is] called Beautiful, so that he might beg for charitable gifts from those who entered the temple. -- acts 3:2
.
So when he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them to give him a gift. -- acts 3:3
.
And Peter directed his gaze intently at him, and so did John, and said, Look at us! -- acts 3:4
.
And [the man] paid attention to them, expecting that he was going to get something from them. -- acts 3:5
.
But Peter said, Silver and gold (money) I do not have; but what I do have, that I give to you: in [the use of] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk! -- acts 3:6
.
Then he took hold of the man's right hand with a firm grip and raised him up. And at once his feet and ankle bones became strong and steady, -- acts 3:7
.
And leaping forth he stood and began to walk, and he went into the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. -- acts 3:8
.
And all the people saw him walking about and praising God, -- acts 3:9
.
And they recognized him as the man who usually sat [begging] for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement (bewilderment, consternation) over what had occurred to him. -- acts 3:10
.
Now while he [still] firmly clung to Peter and John, all the people in utmost amazement ran together and crowded around them in the covered porch (walk) called Solomon's. -- acts 3:11
.
And Peter, seeing it, answered the people, You men of Israel, why are you so surprised and wondering at this? Why do you keep staring at us, as though by our [own individual] power or [active] piety we had made this man [able] to walk? -- acts 3:12
.
The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified His Servant and Son Jesus [doing Him this honor], Whom you indeed delivered up and denied and rejected and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to let Him go. -- acts 3:13
.
But you denied and rejected and disowned the Pure and Holy, the Just and Blameless One, and demanded [the pardon of] a murderer to be granted to you. -- acts 3:14
.
But you killed the very Source (the Author) of life, Whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. -- acts 3:15
.
And His name, through and by faith in His name, has made this man whom you see and recognize well and strong. [Yes] the faith which is through and by Him [Jesus] has given the man this perfect soundness [of body] before all of you. -- acts 3:16
.
And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance [not aware of what you were doing], as did your rulers also. -- acts 3:17
.
Thus has God fulfilled what He foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ (the Messiah) should undergo ill treatment and be afflicted and suffer. -- acts 3:18
.
So repent (change your mind and purpose); turn around and return [to God], that your sins may be erased (blotted out, wiped clean), that times of refreshing (of recovering from the effects of heat, of reviving with fresh air) may come from the presence of the Lord; -- acts 3:19
.
And that He may send [to you] the Christ (the Messiah), Who before was designated and appointed for you--even Jesus, -- acts 3:20
.
Whom heaven must receive [and retain] until the time for the complete restoration of all that God spoke by the mouth of all His holy prophets for ages past [from the most ancient time in the memory of man]. -- acts 3:21
.
Thus Moses said to the forefathers, The Lord God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as [He raised up] me; Him you shall listen to and understand by hearing and heed in all things whatever He tells you. -- acts 3:22
.
And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to and understand by hearing and heed that Prophet shall be utterly exterminated from among the people. -- acts 3:23
.
Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and those who came afterwards, as many as have spoken, also promised and foretold and proclaimed these days. -- acts 3:24
.
You are the descendants (sons) of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant which God made and gave to your forefathers, saying to Abraham, And in your Seed (Heir) shall all the families of the earth be blessed and benefited. -- acts 3:25
.
It was to you first that God sent His Servant and Son Jesus, when He raised Him up [provided and gave Him for us], to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness and evil ways. -- acts 3:26
.
AND WHILE they [Peter and John] were talking to the people, the high priests and the military commander of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, -- acts 4:1
.
Being vexed and indignant through and through because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in [the case of] Jesus the resurrection from the dead. -- acts 4:2
.
So they laid hands on them (arrested them) and put them in prison until the following day, for it was already evening. -- acts 4:3
.
But many of those who heard the message believed (adhered to and trusted in and relied on Jesus as the Christ). And their number grew and came to about 5,000. -- acts 4:4
.
Then on the following day, their magistrates and elders and scribes were assembled in Jerusalem, -- acts 4:5
.
Including Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all others who belonged to the high priestly relationship. -- acts 4:6
.
And they set the men in their midst and repeatedly demanded, By what sort of power or by what kind of authority did [such people as] you do this [healing]? -- acts 4:7
.
Then Peter, [because he was] filled with [and controlled by] the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and members of the council (the Sanhedrin), -- acts 4:8
.
If we are being put on trial [here] today and examined concerning a good deed done to benefit a feeble (helpless) cripple, by what means this man has been restored to health, -- acts 4:9
.
Let it be known and understood by all of you, and by the whole house of Israel, that in the name and through the power and authority of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Whom you crucified, [but] Whom God raised from the dead, in Him and by means of Him this man is standing here before you well and sound in body. -- acts 4:10
.
This [Jesus] is the Stone which was despised and rejected by you, the builders, but which has become the Head of the corner [the Cornerstone]. -- acts 4:11
.
And there is salvation in and through no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by and in which we must be saved. -- acts 4:12
.
Now when they saw the boldness and unfettered eloquence of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and untrained in the schools [common men with no educational advantages], they marveled; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus. -- acts 4:13
.
And since they saw the man who had been cured standing there beside them, they could not contradict the fact or say anything in opposition. -- acts 4:14
.
But having ordered [the prisoners] to go aside out of the council [chamber], they conferred (debated) among themselves, -- acts 4:15
.
Saying, What are we to do with these men? For that an extraordinary miracle has been performed by (through) them is plain to all the residents of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. -- acts 4:16
.
But in order that it may not spread further among the people and the nation, let us warn and forbid them with a stern threat to speak any more to anyone in this name [or about this Person]. -- acts 4:17
.
[So] they summoned them and imperatively instructed them not to converse in any way or teach at all in or about the name of Jesus. -- acts 4:18
.
But Peter and John replied to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you and obey you rather than God, you must decide (judge). -- acts 4:19
.
But we [ourselves] cannot help telling what we have seen and heard. -- acts 4:20
.
Then when [the rulers and council members] had further threatened them, they let them go, not seeing how they could secure a conviction against them because of the people; for everybody was praising and glorifying God for what had occurred. -- acts 4:21
.
For the man on whom this sign (miracle) of healing was performed was more than forty years old. -- acts 4:22
.
After they were permitted to go, [the apostles] returned to their own [company] and told all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. -- acts 4:23
.
And when they heard it, lifted their voices together with one united mind to God and said, O Sovereign Lord, You are He Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that is in them, -- acts 4:24
.
Who by the mouth of our forefather David, Your servant and child, said through the Holy Spirit, Why did the heathen (Gentiles) become wanton and insolent and rage, and the people imagine and study and plan vain (fruitless) things [that will not succeed]? -- acts 4:25
.
The kings of the earth took their stand in array [for attack] and the rulers were assembled and combined together against the Lord and against His Anointed (Christ, the Messiah). -- acts 4:26
.
For in this city there actually met and plotted together against Your holy Child and Servant Jesus, Whom You consecrated by anointing, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and peoples of Israel, -- acts 4:27
.
To carry out all that Your hand and Your will and purpose had predestined (predetermined) should occur. -- acts 4:28
.
And now, Lord, observe their threats and grant to Your bond servants [full freedom] to declare Your message fearlessly, -- acts 4:29
.
While You stretch out Your hand to cure and to perform signs and wonders through the authority and by the power of the name of Your holy Child and Servant Jesus. -- acts 4:30
.
And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they continued to speak the Word of God with freedom and boldness and courage. -- acts 4:31
.
Now the company of believers was of one heart and soul, and not one of them claimed that anything which he possessed was [exclusively] his own, but everything they had was in common and for the use of all. -- acts 4:32
.
And with great strength and ability and power the apostles delivered their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace (loving-kindness and favor and goodwill) rested richly upon them all. -- acts 4:33
.
Nor was there a destitute or needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses proceeded to sell them, and one by one they brought (gave back) the amount received from the sales -- acts 4:34
.
And laid it at the feet of the apostles (special messengers). Then distribution was made according as anyone had need. -- acts 4:35
.
Now Joseph, a Levite and native of Cyprus who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, which interpreted means Son of Encouragement, -- acts 4:36
.
Sold a field which belonged to him and brought the sum of money and laid it at the feet of the apostles. -- acts 4:37
.
BUT A certain man named Ananias with his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property, -- acts 5:1
.
And with his wife's knowledge and connivance he kept back and wrongfully appropriated some of the proceeds, bringing only a part and putting it at the feet of the apostles. -- acts 5:2
.
But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart that you should lie to and attempt to deceive the Holy Spirit, and should [in violation of your promise] withdraw secretly and appropriate to your own use part of the price from the sale of the land? -- acts 5:3
.
As long as it remained unsold, was it not still your own? And [even] after it was sold, was not [the money] at your disposal and under your control? Why then, is it that you have proposed and purposed in your heart to do this thing? [How could you have the heart to do such a deed?] You have not [simply] lied to men [playing false and showing yourself utterly deceitful] but to God. -- acts 5:4
.
Upon hearing these words, Ananias fell down and died. And great dread and terror took possession of all who heard of it. -- acts 5:5
.
And the young men arose and wrapped up [the body] and carried it out and buried it. -- acts 5:6
.
Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not having learned of what had happened. -- acts 5:7
.
And Peter said to her, Tell me, did you sell the land for so much? Yes, she said, for so much. -- acts 5:8
.
Then Peter said to her, How could you two have agreed and conspired together to try to deceive the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out [also]. -- acts 5:9
.
And instantly she fell down at his feet and died; and the young men entering found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. -- acts 5:10
.
And the whole church and all others who heard of these things were appalled [great awe and strange terror and dread seized them]. -- acts 5:11
.
Now by the hands of the apostles (special messengers) numerous and startling signs and wonders were being performed among the people. And by common consent they all met together [at the temple] in the covered porch (walk) called Solomon's. -- acts 5:12
.
And none of those who were not of their number dared to join and associate with them, but the people held them in high regard and praised and made much of them. -- acts 5:13
.
More and more there were being added to the Lord those who believed [those who acknowledged Jesus as their Savior and devoted themselves to Him joined and gathered with them], crowds both of men and of women, -- acts 5:14
.
So that they [even] kept carrying out the sick into the streets and placing them on couches and sleeping pads, [in the hope] that as Peter passed by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them. -- acts 5:15
.
And the people gathered also from the towns and hamlets around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those troubled with foul spirits, and they were all cured. -- acts 5:16
.
But the high priest rose up and all who were his supporters, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and being filled with jealousy and indignation and rage, -- acts 5:17
.
They seized and arrested the apostles (special messengers) and put them in the public jail. -- acts 5:18
.
But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and, leading them out, said, -- acts 5:19
.
Go, take your stand in the temple courts and declare to the people the whole doctrine concerning this Life (the eternal life which Christ revealed). -- acts 5:20
.
And when they heard this, they accordingly went into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now the high priest and his supporters who were with him arrived and called together the council (Sanhedrin), even all the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison to have [the apostles] brought. -- acts 5:21
.
But when the attendants arrived there, they failed to find them in the jail; so they came back and reported, -- acts 5:22
.
We found the prison quite safely locked up and the guards were on duty outside the doors, but when we opened [it], we found no one on the inside. -- acts 5:23
.
Now when the military leader of the temple area and the chief priests heard these facts, they were much perplexed and thoroughly at a loss about them, wondering into what this might grow. -- acts 5:24
.
But some man came and reported to them, saying, Listen! The men whom you put in jail are standing [right here] in the temple and teaching the people! -- acts 5:25
.
Then the military leader went with the attendants and brought [the prisoners], but without violence, for they dreaded the people lest they be stoned by them. -- acts 5:26
.
So they brought them and set them before the council (Sanhedrin). And the high priest examined them by questioning, -- acts 5:27
.
Saying, We definitely commanded and strictly charged you not to teach in or about this Name; yet here you have flooded Jerusalem with your doctrine and you intend to bring this Man's blood upon us. -- acts 5:28
.
Then Peter and the apostles replied, We must obey God rather than men. -- acts 5:29
.
The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, Whom you killed by hanging Him on a tree (cross). -- acts 5:30
.
God exalted Him to His right hand to be Prince and Leader and Savior and Deliverer and Preserver, in order to grant repentance to Israel and to bestow forgiveness and release from sins. -- acts 5:31
.
And we are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit is also, Whom God has bestowed on those who obey Him. -- acts 5:32
.
Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and infuriated and wanted to kill the disciples. -- acts 5:33
.
But a certain Pharisee in the council (Sanhedrin) named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, highly esteemed by all the people, standing up, ordered that the apostles be taken outside for a little while. -- acts 5:34
.
Then he addressed them [the council, saying]: Men of Israel, take care in regard to what you propose to do concerning these men. -- acts 5:35
.
For before our time there arose Theudas, asserting himself to be a person of importance, with whom a number of men allied themselves, about 400; but he was killed and all who had listened to and adhered to him were scattered and brought to nothing. -- acts 5:36
.
And after this one rose up Judas the Galilean, [who led an uprising] during the time of the census, and drew away a popular following after him; he also perished and all his adherents were scattered. -- acts 5:37
.
Now in the present case let me say to you, stand off (withdraw) from these men and let them alone. For if this doctrine or purpose or undertaking or movement is of human origin, it will fail (be overthrown and come to nothing); -- acts 5:38
.
But if it is of God, you will not be able to stop or overthrow or destroy them; you might even be found fighting against God! -- acts 5:39
.
So, convinced by him, they took his advice; and summoning the apostles, they flogged them and sternly forbade them to speak in or about the name of Jesus, and allowed them to go. -- acts 5:40
.
So they went out from the presence of the council (Sanhedrin), rejoicing that they were being counted worthy [dignified by the indignity] to suffer shame and be exposed to disgrace for [the sake of] His name. -- acts 5:41
.
Yet [in spite of the threats] they never ceased for a single day, both in the temple area and at home, to teach and to proclaim the good news (Gospel) of Jesus [as] the Christ (the Messiah). -- acts 5:42
.
NOW ABOUT this time, when the number of the disciples was greatly increasing, complaint was made by the Hellenists (the Greek-speaking Jews) against the [native] Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked and neglected in the daily ministration (distribution of relief). -- acts 6:1
.
So the Twelve [apostles] convened the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not seemly or desirable or right that we should have to give up or neglect [preaching] the Word of God in order to attend to serving at tables and superintending the distribution of food. -- acts 6:2
.
Therefore select out from among yourselves, brethren, seven men of good and attested character and repute, full of the [Holy] Spirit and wisdom, whom we may assign to look after this business and duty. -- acts 6:3
.
But we will continue to devote ourselves steadfastly to prayer and the ministry of the Word. -- acts 6:4
.
And the suggestion pleased the whole assembly, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith (a strong and welcome belief that Jesus is the Messiah) and full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte (convert) from Antioch. -- acts 6:5
.
These they presented to the apostles, who after prayer laid their hands on them. -- acts 6:6
.
And the message of God kept on spreading, and the number of disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and [besides] a large number of the priests were obedient to the faith [in Jesus as the Messiah, through Whom is obtained eternal salvation in the kingdom of God]. -- acts 6:7
.
Now Stephen, full of grace (divine blessing and favor) and power (strength and ability) worked great wonders and signs (miracles) among the people. -- acts 6:8
.
However, some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (freed Jewish slaves), as it was called, and [of the synagogues] of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and [the province of] Asia, arose [and undertook] to debate and dispute with Stephen. -- acts 6:9
.
But they were not able to resist the intelligence and the wisdom and [the inspiration of] the Spirit with which and by Whom he spoke. -- acts 6:10
.
So they [secretly] instigated and instructed men to say, We have heard this man speak, using slanderous and abusive and blasphemous language against Moses and God. -- acts 6:11
.
[Thus] they incited the people as well as the elders and the scribes, and they came upon Stephen and arrested him and took him before the council (Sanhedrin). -- acts 6:12
.
And they brought forward false witnesses who asserted, This man never stops making statements against this sacred place and the Law [of Moses]; -- acts 6:13
.
For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will tear down and destroy this place, and will alter the institutions and usages which Moses transmitted to us. -- acts 6:14
.
Then all who sat in the council (Sanhedrin), as they gazed intently at Stephen, saw that his face had the appearance of the face of an angel. -- acts 6:15
.
AND THE high priest asked [Stephen], Are these charges true? -- acts 7:1
.
And he answered, Brethren and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was still in Mesopotamia, before he [went to] live in Haran, -- acts 7:2
.
And He said to him, Leave your own country and your relatives and come into the land (region) that I will point out to you. -- acts 7:3
.
So then he went forth from the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, [God] transferred him to this country in which you are now dwelling. -- acts 7:4
.
Yet He gave him no inheritable property in it, [no] not even enough ground to set his foot on; but He promised that He would give it to Him for a permanent possession and to his descendants after him, even though [as yet] he had no child. -- acts 7:5
.
And this is [in effect] what God told him: That his descendants would be aliens (strangers) in a land belonging to other people, who would bring them into bondage and ill-treat them years. -- acts 7:6
.
But I will judge the nation to whom they will be slaves, said God, and after that they will escape and come forth and worship Me in this [very] place. -- acts 7:7
.
And [God] made with Abraham a covenant (an agreement to be religiously observed) of which circumcision was the seal. And under these circumstances [Abraham] became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac [did so] when he became the father of Jacob, and Jacob [when each of his sons was born], the twelve patriarchs. -- acts 7:8
.
And the patriarchs [Jacob's sons], boiling with envy and hatred and anger, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him, -- acts 7:9
.
And delivered him from all his distressing afflictions and won him goodwill and favor and wisdom and understanding in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over Egypt and all his house. -- acts 7:10
.
Then there came a famine over all of Egypt and Canaan, with great distress, and our forefathers could find no fodder [for the cattle] or vegetable sustenance [for their households]. -- acts 7:11
.
But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our forefathers [to go there on their] first trip. -- acts 7:12
.
And on their second visit Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh and his origin and race. -- acts 7:13
.
And Joseph sent an invitation calling to himself Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. -- acts 7:14
.
And Jacob went down into Egypt, where he himself died, as did [also] our forefathers; -- acts 7:15
.
And their bodies [Jacob's and Joseph's] were taken back to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of [silver] money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. -- acts 7:16
.
But as the time for the fulfillment of the promise drew near which God had made to Abraham, the [Hebrew] people increased and multiplied in Egypt, -- acts 7:17
.
Until [the time when] there arose over Egypt another and a different king who did not know Joseph [neither knowing his history and services nor recognizing his merits]. -- acts 7:18
.
He dealt treacherously with and defrauded our race; he abused and oppressed our forefathers, forcing them to expose their babies so that they might not be kept alive. -- acts 7:19
.
At this juncture Moses was born, and was exceedingly beautiful in God's sight. For three months he was nurtured in his father's house; -- acts 7:20
.
Then when he was exposed [to perish], the daughter of Pharaoh rescued him and took him and reared him as her own son. -- acts 7:21
.
So Moses was educated in all the wisdom and culture of the Egyptians, and he was mighty (powerful) in his speech and deeds. -- acts 7:22
.
And when he was in his fortieth year, it came into his heart to visit his kinsmen the children of Israel [to help them and to care for them]. -- acts 7:23
.
And on seeing one of them being unjustly treated, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian and slaying [him]. -- acts 7:24
.
He expected his brethren to understand that God was granting them deliverance by his hand [taking it for granted that they would accept him]; but they did not understand. -- acts 7:25
.
Then on the next day he suddenly appeared to some who were quarreling and fighting among themselves, and he urged them to make peace and become reconciled, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you abuse and wrong one another? -- acts 7:26
.
Whereupon the man who was abusing his neighbor pushed [Moses] aside, saying, Who appointed you a ruler (umpire) and a judge over us? -- acts 7:27
.
Do you intend to slay me as you slew the Egyptian yesterday? -- acts 7:28
.
At that reply Moses sought safety by flight and he was an exile and an alien in the country of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. -- acts 7:29
.
And when forty years had gone by, there appeared to him in the wilderness (desert) of Mount Sinai an angel, in the flame of a burning bramblebush. -- acts 7:30
.
When Moses saw it, he was astonished and marveled at the sight; but when he went close to investigate, there came to him the voice of the Lord, saying, -- acts 7:31
.
I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. And Moses trembled and was so terrified that he did not venture to look. -- acts 7:32
.
Then the Lord said to him, Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground and worthy of veneration. -- acts 7:33
.
Because I have most assuredly seen the abuse and oppression of My people in Egypt and have heard their sighing and groaning, I have come down to rescue them. So, now come! I will send you back to Egypt [as My messenger]. -- acts 7:34
.
It was this very Moses whom they had denied (disowned and rejected), saying, Who made you our ruler (referee) and judge? whom God sent to be a ruler and deliverer and redeemer, by and with the [protecting and helping] hand of the Angel that appeared to him in the bramblebush. -- acts 7:35
.
He it was who led them forth, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and during the forty years in the wilderness (desert). -- acts 7:36
.
It was this [very] Moses who said to the children of Israel, God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as He raised me up. -- acts 7:37
.
This is he who in the assembly in the wilderness (desert) was the go-between for the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and our forefathers, and he received living oracles (words that still live) to be handed down to us. -- acts 7:38
.
[And yet] our forefathers determined not to be subject to him [refusing to listen to or obey him]; but thrusting him aside they rejected him, and in their hearts yearned for and turned back to Egypt. -- acts 7:39
.
And they said to Aaron, Make us gods who shall [be our leaders and] go before us; as for this Moses who led us forth from the land of Egypt--we have no knowledge of what has happened to him. -- acts 7:40
.
And they [even] made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol and made merry and exulted in the work of their [own] hands. -- acts 7:41
.
But God turned [away from them] and delivered them up to worship and serve the host (stars) of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: Did you [really] offer to Me slain beasts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness (desert), O house of Israel? -- acts 7:42
.
[No!] You took up the tent (the portable temple) of Moloch and carried it [with you], and the star of the god Rephan, the images which you [yourselves] made that you might worship them; and I will remove you [carrying you away into exile] beyond Babylon. -- acts 7:43
.
Our forefathers had the tent (tabernacle) of witness in the wilderness, even as He Who directed Moses to make it had ordered, according to the pattern and model he had seen. -- acts 7:44
.
Our forefathers in turn brought it [this tent of witness] in [with them into the land] with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations which God drove out before the face of our forefathers. [So it remained here] until the time of David, -- acts 7:45
.
Who found grace (favor and spiritual blessing) in the sight of God and prayed that he might be allowed to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. [II Sam. 7:8-16; Ps. 132:1-5.] -- acts 7:46
.
But it was Solomon who built a house for Him. [I Kings 6.] -- acts 7:47
.
However, the Most High does not dwell in houses and temples made with hands; as the prophet says, -- acts 7:48
.
Heaven [is] My throne, and earth the footstool for My feet. What [kind of] house can you build for Me, says the Lord, or what is the place in which I can rest? -- acts 7:49
.
Was it not My hand that made all these things? -- acts 7:50
.
You stubborn and stiff-necked people, still heathen and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you are always actively resisting the Holy Spirit. As your forefathers [were], so you [are and so you do]! -- acts 7:51
.
Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? And they slew those who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, Whom you now have betrayed and murdered-- -- acts 7:52
.
You who received the Law as it was ordained and set in order and delivered by angels, and [yet] you did not obey it! -- acts 7:53
.
Now upon hearing these things, they [the Jews] were cut to the heart and infuriated, and they ground their teeth against [Stephen]. -- acts 7:54
.
But he, full of the Holy Spirit and controlled by Him, gazed into heaven and saw the glory (the splendor and majesty) of God, and Jesus standing at God's right hand; -- acts 7:55
.
And he said, Look! I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at God's right hand! -- acts 7:56
.
But they raised a great shout and put their hands over their ears and rushed together upon him. -- acts 7:57
.
Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him, and the witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. -- acts 7:58
.
And while they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, Lord Jesus, receive and accept and welcome my spirit! -- acts 7:59
.
And falling on his knees, he cried out loudly, Lord, fix not this sin upon them [lay it not to their charge]! And when he had said this, he fell asleep [in death]. -- acts 7:60
.
AND SAUL was [not only] consenting to [Stephen's] death [he was pleased and entirely approving]. On that day a great and severe persecution broke out against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles (special messengers). -- acts 8:1
.
[A party of] devout men with others helped to carry out and bury Stephen and made great lamentation over him. -- acts 8:2
.
But Saul shamefully treated and laid waste the church continuously [with cruelty and violence]; and entering house after house, he dragged out men and women and committed them to prison. -- acts 8:3
.
Now those who were scattered abroad went about [through the land from place to place] preaching the glad tidings, the Word [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God]. -- acts 8:4
.
Philip [the deacon, not the apostle] went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ (the Messiah) to them [the people]; -- acts 8:5
.
And great crowds of people with one accord listened to and heeded what was said by Philip, as they heard him and watched the miracles and wonders which he kept performing [from time to time]. -- acts 8:6
.
For foul spirits came out of many who were possessed by them, screaming and shouting with a loud voice, and many who were suffering from palsy or were crippled were restored to health. -- acts 8:7
.
And there was great rejoicing in that city. -- acts 8:8
.
But there was a man named Simon, who had formerly practiced magic arts in the city to the utter amazement of the Samaritan nation, claiming that he himself was an extraordinary and distinguished person. -- acts 8:9
.
They all paid earnest attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that exhibition of the power of God which is called great (intense). -- acts 8:10
.
And they were attentive and made much of him, because for a long time he had amazed and bewildered and dazzled them with his skill in magic arts. -- acts 8:11
.
But when they believed the good news (the Gospel) about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) as Philip preached it, they were baptized, both men and women. -- acts 8:12
.
Even Simon himself believed [he adhered to, trusted in, and relied on the teaching of Philip], and after being baptized, devoted himself constantly to him. And seeing signs and miracles of great power which were being performed, he was utterly amazed. -- acts 8:13
.
Now when the apostles (special messengers) at Jerusalem heard that [the country of] Samaria had accepted and welcomed the Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, -- acts 8:14
.
And they came down and prayed for them that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit; -- acts 8:15
.
For He had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. -- acts 8:16
.
Then [the apostles] laid their hands on them one by one, and they received the Holy Spirit. -- acts 8:17
.
However, when Simon saw that the [Holy] Spirit was imparted through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he brought money and offered it to them, -- acts 8:18
.
Saying, Grant me also this power and authority, in order that anyone on whom I place my hands may receive the Holy Spirit. -- acts 8:19
.
But Peter said to him, Destruction overtake your money and you, because you imagined you could obtain the [free] gift of God with money! -- acts 8:20
.
You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is all wrong in God's sight [it is not straightforward or right or true before God]. -- acts 8:21
.
So repent of this depravity and wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord that, if possible, this contriving thought and purpose of your heart may be removed and disregarded and forgiven you. -- acts 8:22
.
For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in a bond forged by iniquity [to fetter souls]. -- acts 8:23
.
And Simon answered, Pray for me [beseech the Lord, both of you], that nothing of what you have said may befall me! -- acts 8:24
.
Now when [the apostles] had borne their testimony and preached the message of the Lord, they went back to Jerusalem, proclaiming the glad tidings (Gospel) to many villages of the Samaritans [on the way]. -- acts 8:25
.
But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Rise and proceed southward or at midday on the road that runs from Jerusalem down to Gaza. This is the desert [route]. -- acts 8:26
.
So he got up and went. And behold, an Ethiopian, a eunuch of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship. -- acts 8:27
.
And he was [now] returning, and sitting in his chariot he was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah. -- acts 8:28
.
Then the [Holy] Spirit said to Philip, Go forward and join yourself to this chariot. -- acts 8:29
.
Accordingly Philip, running up to him, heard [the man] reading the prophet Isaiah and asked, Do you really understand what you are reading? -- acts 8:30
.
And he said, How is it possible for me to do so unless someone explains it to me and guides me [in the right way]? And he earnestly requested Philip to come up and sit beside him. -- acts 8:31
.
Now this was the passage of Scripture which he was reading: Like a sheep He was led to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He opens not His mouth. -- acts 8:32
.
In His humiliation He was taken away by distressing and oppressive judgment and justice was denied Him [caused to cease]. Who can describe or relate in full the wickedness of His contemporaries (generation)? For His life is taken from the earth and a bloody death inflicted upon Him. -- acts 8:33
.
And the eunuch said to Philip, I beg of you, tell me about whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else? -- acts 8:34
.
Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this portion of Scripture he announced to him the glad tidings (Gospel) of Jesus and about Him. -- acts 8:35
.
And as they continued along on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch exclaimed, See, [here is] water! What is to hinder my being baptized? -- acts 8:36
.
And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart [if you have a conviction, full of joyful trust, that Jesus is the Messiah and accept Him as the Author of your salvation in the kingdom of God, giving Him your obedience, then] you may. And he replied, I do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. -- acts 8:37
.
And he ordered that the chariot be stopped; and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and [Philip] baptized him. -- acts 8:38
.
And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord [suddenly] caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and he went on his way rejoicing. -- acts 8:39
.
But Philip was found at Azotus, and passing on he preached the good news (Gospel) to all the towns until he reached Caesarea. -- acts 8:40
.
MEANWHILE SAUL, still drawing his breath hard from threatening and murderous desire against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest -- acts 9:1
.
And requested of him letters to the synagogues at Damascus [authorizing him], so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way [of life as determined by faith in Jesus Christ], he might bring them bound [with chains] to Jerusalem. -- acts 9:2
.
Now as he traveled on, he came near to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him, -- acts 9:3
.
And he fell to the ground. Then he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me [harassing, troubling, and molesting Me]? -- acts 9:4
.
And Saul said, Who are You, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, Whom you are persecuting. It is dangerous and it will turn out badly for you to keep kicking against the goad [to offer vain and perilous resistance]. -- acts 9:5
.
Trembling and astonished he asked, Lord, what do You desire me to do? The Lord said to him, But arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do. -- acts 9:6
.
The men who were accompanying him were unable to speak [for terror], hearing the voice but seeing no one. -- acts 9:7
.
Then Saul got up from the ground, but though his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. -- acts 9:8
.
And he was unable to see for three days, and he neither ate nor drank [anything]. -- acts 9:9
.
Now there was in Damascus a disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he answered, Here am I, Lord. -- acts 9:10
.
And the Lord said to him, Get up and go to the street called Straight and ask at the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying [there]. -- acts 9:11
.
And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias enter and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight. -- acts 9:12
.
But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard many people tell about this man, especially how much evil and what great suffering he has brought on Your saints at Jerusalem; -- acts 9:13
.
Now he is here and has authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call upon Your name. -- acts 9:14
.
But the Lord said to him, Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of Mine to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the descendants of Israel; -- acts 9:15
.
For I will make clear to him how much he will be afflicted and must endure and suffer for My name's sake. -- acts 9:16
.
So Ananias left and went into the house. And he laid his hands on Saul and said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, Who appeared to you along the way by which you came here, has sent me that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit. -- acts 9:17
.
And instantly something like scales fell from [Saul's] eyes, and he recovered his sight. Then he arose and was baptized, -- acts 9:18
.
And after he took some food, he was strengthened. For several days [afterward] he remained with the disciples at Damascus. -- acts 9:19
.
And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, saying, He is the Son of God! -- acts 9:20
.
And all who heard him were amazed and said, Is not this the very man who harassed and overthrew and destroyed in Jerusalem those who called upon this Name? And he has come here for the express purpose of arresting them and bringing them in chains before the chief priests. -- acts 9:21
.
But Saul increased all the more in strength, and continued to confound and put to confusion the Jews who lived in Damascus by comparing and examining evidence and proving that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah). -- acts 9:22
.
After considerable time had elapsed, the Jews conspired to put Saul out of the way by slaying him, -- acts 9:23
.
But [the knowledge of] their plot was made known to Saul. They were guarding the [city's] gates day and night to kill him, -- acts 9:24
.
But his disciples took him at night and let him down through the [city's] wall, lowering him in a basket or hamper. -- acts 9:25
.
And when he had arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to associate himself with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe he really was a disciple. -- acts 9:26
.
However, Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he explained to them how along the way he had seen the Lord, Who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached freely and confidently and courageously in the name of Jesus. -- acts 9:27
.
So he went in and out [as one] among them at Jerusalem, -- acts 9:28
.
Preaching freely and confidently and boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and discussed with and disputed against the Hellenists (the Grecian Jews), but they were seeking to slay him. -- acts 9:29
.
And when the brethren found it out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus [his home town]. -- acts 9:30
.
So the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was edified [growing in wisdom, virtue, and piety] and walking in the respect and reverential fear of the Lord and in the consolation and exhortation of the Holy Spirit, continued to increase and was multiplied. -- acts 9:31
.
Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he went down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. -- acts 9:32
.
There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedfast for eight years and was paralyzed. -- acts 9:33
.
And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [now] makes you whole. Get up and make your bed! And immediately [Aeneas] stood up. -- acts 9:34
.
Then all the inhabitants of Lydda and the plain of Sharon saw [what had happened to] him and they turned to the Lord. -- acts 9:35
.
Now there was at Joppa a disciple [a woman] named [in Aramaic] Tabitha, which [in Greek] means Dorcas. She was abounding in good deeds and acts of charity. -- acts 9:36
.
About that time she fell sick and died, and when they had cleansed her, they laid [her] in an upper room. -- acts 9:37
.
Since Lydda was near Joppa [however], the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him begging him, Do come to us without delay. -- acts 9:38
.
So Peter [immediately] rose and accompanied them. And when he had arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood around him, crying and displaying undershirts (tunics) and [other] garments such as Dorcas was accustomed to make while she was with them. -- acts 9:39
.
But Peter put them all out [of the room] and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, Tabitha, get up! And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she raised herself and sat upright. -- acts 9:40
.
And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling in God's people and the widows, he presented her to them alive. -- acts 9:41
.
And this became known throughout all Joppa, and many came to believe on the Lord [to adhere to and trust in and rely on Him as the Christ and as their Savior]. -- acts 9:42
.
And Peter remained in Joppa for considerable time with a certain Simon a tanner. -- acts 9:43
.
NOW [living] at Caesarea there was a man whose name was Cornelius, a centurion (captain) of what was known as the Italian Regiment, -- acts 10:1
.
A devout man who venerated God and treated Him with reverential obedience, as did all his household; and he gave much alms to the people and prayed continually to God. -- acts 10:2
.
About the ninth hour (about 3:p.m.) of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God entering and saying to him, Cornelius! -- acts 10:3
.
And he, gazing intently at him, became frightened and said, What is it, Lord? And the angel said to him, Your prayers and your [generous] gifts to the poor have come up [as a sacrifice] to God and have been remembered by Him. -- acts 10:4
.
And now send men to Joppa and have them call for and invite here a certain Simon whose surname is Peter; -- acts 10:5
.
He is lodging with Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside. -- acts 10:6
.
When the angel who spoke to him had left, Cornelius called two of his servants and a God-fearing soldier from among his own personal attendants. -- acts 10:7
.
And having rehearsed everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. -- acts 10:8
.
The next day as they were still on their way and were approaching the town, Peter went up to the roof of the house to pray, about the sixth hour (noon). -- acts 10:9
.
But he became very hungry, and wanted something to eat; and while the meal was being prepared a trance came over him, -- acts 10:10
.
And he saw the sky opened and something like a great sheet lowered by the four corners, descending to the earth. -- acts 10:11
.
It contained all kinds of quadrupeds and wild beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the air. -- acts 10:12
.
And there came a voice to him, saying, Rise up, Peter, kill and eat. -- acts 10:13
.
But Peter said, No, by no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unhallowed or [ceremonially] unclean. -- acts 10:14
.
And the voice came to him again a second time, What God has cleansed and pronounced clean, do not you defile and profane by regarding and calling common and unhallowed or unclean. -- acts 10:15
.
This occurred three times; then immediately the sheet was taken up to heaven. -- acts 10:16
.
Now Peter was still inwardly perplexed and doubted as to what the vision which he had seen could mean, when [just then] behold the messengers that were sent by Cornelius, who had made inquiry for Simon's house, stopped and stood before the gate. -- acts 10:17
.
And they called out to inquire whether Simon who was surnamed Peter was staying there. -- acts 10:18
.
And while Peter was earnestly revolving the vision in his mind and meditating on it, the [Holy] Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are looking for you! -- acts 10:19
.
Get up and go below and accompany them without any doubt [about its legality] or any discrimination or hesitation, for I have sent them. -- acts 10:20
.
Then Peter went down to the men and said, I am the man you seek; what is the purpose of your coming? -- acts 10:21
.
And they said, Cornelius, a centurion (captain) who is just and upright and in right standing with God, being God-fearing and obedient and well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house; and he has received in answer [to prayer] a warning to listen to and act upon what you have to say. -- acts 10:22
.
So Peter invited them in to be his guests [for the night]. The next day he arose and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. -- acts 10:23
.
And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for and expecting them, and he had invited together his relatives and his intimate friends. -- acts 10:24
.
As Peter arrived, Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet he made obeisance and paid worshipful reverence to him. -- acts 10:25
.
But Peter raised him up, saying, Get up; I myself am also a man. -- acts 10:26
.
And as [Peter] spoke with him, he entered the house and found a large group of persons assembled; -- acts 10:27
.
And he said to them, You yourselves are aware how it is not lawful or permissible for a Jew to keep company with or to visit or [even] to come near or to speak first to anyone of another nationality, but God has shown and taught me by words that I should not call any human being common or unhallowed or [ceremonially] unclean. -- acts 10:28
.
Therefore when I was sent for, I came without hesitation or objection or misgivings. So now I ask for what reason you sent for me. -- acts 10:29
.
And Cornelius said, This is now the fourth day since about this time I was observing the ninth hour (three o'clock in the afternoon) of prayer in my lodging place; [suddenly] a man stood before me in dazzling apparel, -- acts 10:30
.
And he said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and harkened to, and your donations to the poor have been known and preserved before God [so that He heeds and is about to help you]. -- acts 10:31
.
Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is surnamed Peter; he is staying in the house of Simon the tanner by the seaside. -- acts 10:32
.
So at once I sent for you, and you [being a Jew] have done a kind and courteous and handsome thing in coming. Now then, we are all present in the sight of God to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say. -- acts 10:33
.
And Peter opened his mouth and said: Most certainly and thoroughly I now perceive and understand that God shows no partiality and is no respecter of persons, -- acts 10:34
.
But in every nation he who venerates and has a reverential fear for God, treating Him with worshipful obedience and living uprightly, is acceptable to Him and sure of being received and welcomed [by Him]. -- acts 10:35
.
You know the contents of the message which He sent to Israel, announcing the good news (Gospel) of peace by Jesus Christ, Who is Lord of all-- -- acts 10:36
.
The [same] message which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee after the baptism preached by John-- -- acts 10:37
.
How God anointed and consecrated Jesus of Nazareth with the [Holy] Spirit and with strength and ability and power; how He went about doing good and, in particular, curing all who were harassed and oppressed by [the power of] the devil, for God was with Him. -- acts 10:38
.
And we are [eye and ear] witnesses of everything that He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. And [yet] they put Him out of the way (murdered Him) by hanging Him on a tree; -- acts 10:39
.
But God raised Him to life on the third day and caused Him to be manifest (to be plainly seen), -- acts 10:40
.
Not by all the people but to us who were chosen (designated) beforehand by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. -- acts 10:41
.
And He charged us to preach to the people and to bear solemn testimony that He is the God-appointed and God-ordained Judge of the living and the dead. -- acts 10:42
.
To Him all the prophets testify (bear witness) that everyone who believes in Him [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him, giving himself up to Him] receives forgiveness of sins through His name. -- acts 10:43
.
While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message. -- acts 10:44
.
And the believers from among the circumcised [the Jews] who came with Peter were surprised and amazed, because the free gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed and poured out largely even on the Gentiles. -- acts 10:45
.
For they heard them talking in [unknown] tongues (languages) and extolling and magnifying God. Then Peter asked, -- acts 10:46
.
Can anyone forbid or refuse water for baptizing these people, seeing that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have? -- acts 10:47
.
And he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (the Messiah). Then they begged him to stay on there for some days. -- acts 10:48
.
NOW THE apostles (special messengers) and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard [with astonishment] that the Gentiles (heathen) also had received and accepted and welcomed the Word of God [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God]. -- acts 11:1
.
So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party [certain Jewish Christians] found fault with him [separating themselves from him in a hostile spirit, opposing and disputing and contending with him], -- acts 11:2
.
Saying, Why did you go to uncircumcised men and [even] eat with them? -- acts 11:3
.
But Peter began [at the beginning] and narrated and explained to them step by step [the whole list of events]. He said: -- acts 11:4
.
I was in the town of Joppa praying, and [falling] in a trance I saw a vision of something coming down from heaven, like a huge sheet lowered by the four corners; and it descended until it came to me. -- acts 11:5
.
Gazing intently and closely at it, I observed in it [a variety of] four-footed animals and wild beasts and reptiles of the earth and birds of the air, -- acts 11:6
.
And I heard a voice saying to me, Get up, Peter; kill and eat. -- acts 11:7
.
But I said, No, by no means, Lord; for nothing common or unhallowed or [ceremonially] unclean has ever entered my mouth. -- acts 11:8
.
But the voice answered a second time from heaven, What God has cleansed and pronounced clean, do not you defile and profane by regarding or calling it common or unhallowed or unclean. -- acts 11:9
.
This occurred three times, and then all was drawn up again into heaven. -- acts 11:10
.
And right then the three men sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house in which we were. -- acts 11:11
.
And the [Holy] Spirit instructed me to accompany them without [the least] hesitation or misgivings or discrimination. So these six brethren accompanied me also, and we went into the man's house. -- acts 11:12
.
And he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house which stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa and bring Simon who is surnamed Peter; -- acts 11:13
.
He will give and explain to you a message by means of which you and all your household [as well] will be saved [from eternal death]. -- acts 11:14
.
When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as He did on us at the beginning. -- acts 11:15
.
Then I recalled the declaration of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with (be placed in, introduced into) the Holy Spirit. -- acts 11:16
.
If then God gave to them the same Gift [equally] as He gave to us when we believed in (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on) the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I and what power or authority had I to interfere or hinder or forbid or withstand God? -- acts 11:17
.
When they heard this, they were quieted and made no further objection. And they glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance unto [real] life [after resurrection]. -- acts 11:18
.
Meanwhile those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen had traveled as far away as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, without delivering the message [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] to anyone except Jews. -- acts 11:19
.
But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on returning to Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, proclaiming [to them] the good news (the Gospel) about the Lord Jesus. -- acts 11:20
.
And the presence of the Lord was with them with power, so that a great number [learned] to believe (to adhere to and trust in and rely on the Lord) and turned and surrendered themselves to Him. -- acts 11:21
.
The rumors of this came to the ears of the church (assembly) in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. -- acts 11:22
.
When he arrived and saw what grace (favor) God was bestowing upon them, he was full of joy; and he continuously exhorted (warned, urged, and encouraged) them all to cleave unto and remain faithful to and devoted to the Lord with [resolute and steady] purpose of heart. -- acts 11:23
.
For he was a good man [good in himself and also at once for the good and the advantage of other people], full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit and full of faith (of his belief that Jesus is the Messiah, through Whom we obtain eternal salvation). And a large company was added to the Lord. -- acts 11:24
.
[Barnabas] went on to Tarsus to hunt for Saul. -- acts 11:25
.
And when he had found him, he brought him back to Antioch. For a whole year they assembled together with and were guests of the church and instructed a large number of people; and in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians. -- acts 11:26
.
And during these days prophets (inspired teachers and interpreters of the divine will and purpose) came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. -- acts 11:27
.
And one of them named Agabus stood up and prophesied through the [Holy] Spirit that a great and severe famine would come upon the whole world. And this did occur during the reign of Claudius. -- acts 11:28
.
So the disciples resolved to send relief, each according to his individual ability [in proportion as he had prospered], to the brethren who lived in Judea. -- acts 11:29
.
And so they did, sending [their contributions] to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. -- acts 11:30
.
ABOUT THAT time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict and oppress and torment some who belonged to the church (assembly). -- acts 12:1
.
And he killed James the brother of John with a sword; -- acts 12:2
.
And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded further and arrested Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread [the Passover week]. -- acts 12:3
.
And when he had seized [Peter], he put him in prison and delivered him to four squads of soldiers of four each to guard him, purposing after the Passover to bring him forth to the people. -- acts 12:4
.
So Peter was kept in prison, but fervent prayer for him was persistently made to God by the church (assembly). -- acts 12:5
.
The very night before Herod was about to bring him forth, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, fastened with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison. -- acts 12:6
.
And suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared [standing beside him], and a light shone in the place where he was. And the angel gently smote Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, Get up quickly! And the chains fell off his hands. -- acts 12:7
.
And the angel said to him, Tighten your belt and bind on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Wrap your outer garment around you and follow me. -- acts 12:8
.
And [Peter] went out [along] following him, and he was not conscious that what was apparently being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. -- acts 12:9
.
When they had passed through the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate which leads into the city. Of its own accord [the gate] swung open, and they went out and passed on through one street; and at once the angel left him. -- acts 12:10
.
Then Peter came to himself and said, Now I really know and am sure that the Lord has sent His angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting [to do to me]. -- acts 12:11
.
When he, at a glance, became aware of this [comprehending all the elements of the case], he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where a large number were assembled together and were praying. -- acts 12:12
.
And when he knocked at the gate of the porch, a maid named Rhoda came to answer. -- acts 12:13
.
And recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she failed to open the gate, but ran in and told the people that Peter was standing before the porch gate. -- acts 12:14
.
They said to her, You are crazy! But she persistently and strongly and confidently affirmed that it was the truth. They said, It is his angel! -- acts 12:15
.
But meanwhile Peter continued knocking, and when they opened the gate and saw him, they were amazed. -- acts 12:16
.
But motioning to them with his hand to keep quiet and listen, he related to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison. And he said, Report all this to James [the Less] and to the brethren. Then he left and went to some other place. -- acts 12:17
.
Now as soon as it was day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. -- acts 12:18
.
And when Herod had looked for him and could not find him, he placed the guards on trial and commanded that they should be led away [to execution]. Then [Herod] went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed on there. -- acts 12:19
.
Now [Herod] cherished bitter animosity and hostility for the people of Tyre and Sidon; and [their deputies] came to him in a united body, and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was nourished by and depended on the king's [country] for food. -- acts 12:20
.
On an appointed day Herod arrayed himself in his royal robes, took his seat upon [his] throne, and addressed an oration to them. -- acts 12:21
.
And the assembled people shouted, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man! -- acts 12:22
.
And at once an angel of the Lord smote him and cut him down, because he did not give God the glory (the preeminence and kingly majesty that belong to Him as the supreme Ruler); and he was eaten by worms and died. -- acts 12:23
.
But the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] continued to grow and spread. -- acts 12:24
.
And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem when they had completed their mission, bringing with them John whose surname was Mark. -- acts 12:25
.
NOW IN the church (assembly) at Antioch there were prophets (inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God) and teachers: Barnabas, Symeon who was called Niger [Black], Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. -- acts 13:1
.
While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate now for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. -- acts 13:2
.
Then after fasting and praying, they put their hands on them and sent them away. -- acts 13:3
.
So then, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from [that port] they sailed away to Cyprus. -- acts 13:4
.
When they arrived at Salamis, they preached the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John [Mark] as an attendant to assist them. -- acts 13:5
.
When they had passed through the entire island of Cyprus as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain Jewish wizard or sorcerer, a false prophet named Bar-Jesus. -- acts 13:6
.
He was closely associated with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent and sensible man of sound understanding; he summoned to him Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the Word of God [concerning salvation in the kingdom of God attained through Christ]. -- acts 13:7
.
But Elymas the wise man--for that is the translation of his name [which he had given himself]--opposed them, seeking to keep the proconsul from accepting the faith. -- acts 13:8
.
But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit, looked steadily at [Elymas] -- acts 13:9
.
And said, You master in every form of deception and recklessness, unscrupulousness, and wickedness, you son of the devil, you enemy of everything that is upright and good, will you never stop perverting and making crooked the straight paths of the Lord and plotting against His saving purposes? -- acts 13:10
.
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, [so blind that you will be] unable to see the sun for a time. Instantly there fell upon him a mist and a darkness, and he groped about seeking persons who would lead him by the hand. -- acts 13:11
.
Then the proconsul believed (became a Christian) when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished and deeply touched at the teaching concerning the Lord and from Him. -- acts 13:12
.
Now Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John [Mark] separated himself from them and went back to Jerusalem, -- acts 13:13
.
But they [themselves] came on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue there and sat down. -- acts 13:14
.
After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the leaders [of the worship] of the synagogue sent to them saying, Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation or consolation or encouragement for the people, say it. -- acts 13:15
.
So Paul arose, and motioning with his hand said, Men of Israel and you who reverence and fear God, listen! -- acts 13:16
.
The God of this people Israel selected our forefathers and made this people great and important during their stay in the land of Egypt, and then with an uplifted arm He led them out from there. -- acts 13:17
.
And for about forty years like a fatherly nurse He cared for them in the wilderness and endured their behavior. -- acts 13:18
.
When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave them [the Hebrews] their land as an inheritance [distributing it to them by lot; all of which took] about years. -- acts 13:19
.
After that, He gave them judges until the prophet Samuel. -- acts 13:20
.
Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. -- acts 13:21
.
And when He had deposed him, He raised up David to be their king; of him He bore witness and said, I have found David son of Jesse a man after My own heart, who will do all My will and carry out My program fully. [I Sam. 13:14; Ps. 89:20; Isa. 44:28.] -- acts 13:22
.
Of this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior [in the person of Jesus], according to His promise. -- acts 13:23
.
Before His coming John had [already] preached baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. -- acts 13:24
.
And as John was ending his course, he asked, What or who do you secretly think that I am? I am not He [the Christ. No], but note that after me One is coming, the sandals of Whose feet I am not worthy to untie! -- acts 13:25
.
Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and all those others among you who reverence and fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation [the salvation obtained through Jesus Christ]. -- acts 13:26
.
For those who dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not know or recognize Him or understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, have actually fulfilled these very predictions by condemning and sentencing [Him]. -- acts 13:27
.
And although they could find no cause deserving death with which to charge Him, yet they asked Pilate to have Him executed and put out of the way. -- acts 13:28
.
And when they had finished and fulfilled everything that was written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb. -- acts 13:29
.
But God raised Him from the dead. -- acts 13:30
.
And for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they are His witnesses to the people. -- acts 13:31
.
So now we are bringing you the good news (Gospel) that what God promised to our forefathers, -- acts 13:32
.
This He has completely fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second psalm, You are My Son; today I have begotten You [caused You to arise, to be born; formally shown You to be the Messiah by the resurrection]. -- acts 13:33
.
And as to His having raised Him from among the dead, now no more to return to [undergo] putrefaction and dissolution [of the grave], He spoke in this way, I will fulfill and give to you the holy and sure mercy and blessings [that were promised and assured] to David. -- acts 13:34
.
For this reason He says also in another psalm, You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption [to undergo putrefaction and dissolution of the grave]. -- acts 13:35
.
For David, after he had served God's will and purpose and counsel in his own generation, fell asleep [in death] and was buried among his forefathers, and he did see corruption and undergo putrefaction and dissolution [of the grave]. -- acts 13:36
.
But He Whom God raised up [to life] saw no corruption [did not experience putrefaction and dissolution of the grave]. -- acts 13:37
.
So let it be clearly known and understood by you, brethren, that through this Man forgiveness and removal of sins is now proclaimed to you; -- acts 13:38
.
And that through Him everyone who believes [who acknowledges Jesus as his Savior and devotes himself to Him] is absolved (cleared and freed) from every charge from which he could not be justified and freed by the Law of Moses and given right standing with God. -- acts 13:39
.
Take care, therefore, lest there come upon you what is spoken in the prophets: -- acts 13:40
.
Look, you scoffers and scorners, and marvel and perish and vanish away; for I am doing a deed in your days, a deed which you will never have confidence in or believe, [even] if someone [clearly describing it in detail] declares it to you. -- acts 13:41
.
As they [Paul and Barnabas] went out [of the synagogue], the people earnestly begged that these things might be told to them [further] the next Sabbath. -- acts 13:42
.
And when the congregation of the synagogue dispersed, many of the Jews and the devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them and urged them to continue [to trust themselves to and to stand fast] in the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God. -- acts 13:43
.
The next Sabbath almost the entire city gathered together to hear the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God]. -- acts 13:44
.
But when the Jews saw the crowds, filled with envy and jealousy they contradicted what was said by Paul and talked abusively [reviling and slandering him]. -- acts 13:45
.
And Paul and Barnabas spoke out plainly and boldly, saying, It was necessary that God's message [concerning salvation through Christ] should be spoken to you first. But since you thrust it from you, you pass this judgment on yourselves that you are unworthy of eternal life and out of your own mouth you will be judged. [Now] behold, we turn to the Gentiles (the heathen). -- acts 13:46
.
For so the Lord has charged us, saying, I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles (the heathen), that you may bring [eternal] salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth. -- acts 13:47
.
And when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified (praised and gave thanks for) the Word of God; and as many as were destined (appointed and ordained) to eternal life believed (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Jesus as the Christ and their Savior). -- acts 13:48
.
And so the Word of the Lord [concerning eternal salvation through Christ] scattered and spread throughout the whole region. -- acts 13:49
.
But the Jews stirred up the devout women of high rank and the outstanding men of the town, and instigated persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their boundaries. -- acts 13:50
.
But [the apostles] shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. -- acts 13:51
.
And the disciples were continually filled [throughout their souls] with joy and the Holy Spirit. -- acts 13:52
.
NOW AT Iconium [also Paul and Barnabas] went into the Jewish synagogue together and spoke with such power that a great number both of Jews and of Greeks believed (became Christians); -- acts 14:1
.
But the unbelieving Jews [who rejected their message] aroused the Gentiles and embittered their minds against the brethren. -- acts 14:2
.
So [Paul and Barnabas] stayed on there for a long time, speaking freely and fearlessly and boldly in the Lord, Who continued to bear testimony to the Word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands. -- acts 14:3
.
But the residents of the town were divided, some siding with the Jews and some with the apostles. -- acts 14:4
.
When there was an attempt both on the part of the Gentiles and the Jews together with their rulers, to insult and abuse and molest [Paul and Barnabas] and to stone them, -- acts 14:5
.
They, aware of the situation, made their escape to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and the neighboring districts; -- acts 14:6
.
And there they continued to preach the glad tidings (Gospel). -- acts 14:7
.
Now at Lystra a man sat who found it impossible to use his feet, for he was a cripple from birth and had never walked. -- acts 14:8
.
He was listening to Paul as he talked, and [Paul] gazing intently at him and observing that he had faith to be healed, -- acts 14:9
.
Shouted at him, saying, Stand erect on your feet! And he leaped up and walked. -- acts 14:10
.
And the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, shouting in the Lycaonian language, The gods have come down to us in human form! -- acts 14:11
.
They called Barnabas Zeus, and they called Paul, because he led in the discourse, Hermes [god of speech]. -- acts 14:12
.
And the priest of Zeus, whose [temple] was at the entrance of the town, brought bulls and garlands to the [city's] gates and wanted to join the people in offering sacrifice. -- acts 14:13
.
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothing and dashed out among the crowd, shouting, -- acts 14:14
.
Men, why are you doing this? We also are [only] human beings, of nature like your own, and we bring you the good news (Gospel) that you should turn away from these foolish and vain things to the living God, Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that they contain. -- acts 14:15
.
In generations past He permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways; -- acts 14:16
.
Yet He did not neglect to leave some witness of Himself, for He did you good and [showed you] kindness and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with nourishment and happiness. -- acts 14:17
.
Even in [the light of] these words they with difficulty prevented the people from offering sacrifice to them. -- acts 14:18
.
But some Jews arrived there from Antioch and Iconium; and having persuaded the people and won them over, they stoned Paul and [afterward] dragged him out of the town, thinking that he was dead. -- acts 14:19
.
But the disciples formed a circle about him, and he got up and went back into the town; and on the morrow he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. -- acts 14:20
.
When they had preached the good news (Gospel) to that town and made disciples of many of the people, they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch, -- acts 14:21
.
Establishing and strengthening the souls and the hearts of the disciples, urging and warning and encouraging them to stand firm in the faith, and [telling them] that it is through many hardships and tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. -- acts 14:22
.
And when they had appointed and ordained elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in Whom they had come to believe [being full of joyful trust that He is the Christ, the Messiah]. -- acts 14:23
.
Then they went through Pisidia and arrived at Pamphylia. -- acts 14:24
.
And when they had spoken the Word in Perga [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God], they went down to Attalia; -- acts 14:25
.
And from there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had [first] been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had [now] completed. -- acts 14:26
.
Arriving there, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had accomplished with them and how He had opened to the Gentiles a door of faith [in Jesus as the Messiah, through Whom we obtain salvation in the kingdom of God]. -- acts 14:27
.
And there they stayed no little time with the disciples. -- acts 14:28
.
BUT SOME men came down from Judea and were instructing the brethren, Unless you are circumcised in accordance with the Mosaic custom, you cannot be saved. -- acts 15:1
.
And when Paul and Barnabas had no small disagreement and discussion with them, it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the others of their number should go up to Jerusalem [and confer] with the apostles (special messengers) and the elders about this matter. -- acts 15:2
.
So, being fitted out and sent on their way by the church, they went through both Phoenicia and Samaria telling of the conversion of the Gentiles (the heathen), and they caused great rejoicing among all the brethren. -- acts 15:3
.
When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were heartily welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they told them all that God had accomplished through them. -- acts 15:4
.
But some who believed [who acknowledged Jesus as their Savior and devoted themselves to Him] belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, and they rose up and said, It is necessary to circumcise [the Gentile converts] and to charge them to obey the Law of Moses. -- acts 15:5
.
The apostles and the elders were assembled together to look into and consider this matter. -- acts 15:6
.
And after there had been a long debate, Peter got up and said to them, Brethren, you know that quite a while ago God made a choice or selection from among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of the Gospel [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] and believe (credit and place their confidence in it). -- acts 15:7
.
And God, Who is acquainted with and understands the heart, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit as He also did to us; -- acts 15:8
.
And He made no difference between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith (by a strong and welcome conviction that Jesus is the Messiah, through Whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of God). -- acts 15:9
.
Now then, why do you try to test God by putting a yoke on the necks of the disciples, such as neither our forefathers nor we [ourselves] were able to endure? -- acts 15:10
.
But we believe that we are saved through the grace (the undeserved favor and mercy) of the Lord Jesus, just as they [are]. -- acts 15:11
.
Then the whole assembly remained silent, and they listened [attentively] as Barnabas and Paul rehearsed what signs and wonders God had performed through them among the Gentiles. -- acts 15:12
.
When they had finished talking, James replied, Brethren, listen to me. -- acts 15:13
.
Simeon [Peter] has rehearsed how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people [to bear and honor] His name. -- acts 15:14
.
And with this the predictions of the prophets agree, as it is written, -- acts 15:15
.
After this I will come back, and will rebuild the house of David, which has fallen; I will rebuild its [very] ruins, and I will set it up again, -- acts 15:16
.
So that the rest of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom My name has been invoked, -- acts 15:17
.
Says the Lord, Who has been making these things known from the beginning of the world. -- acts 15:18
.
Therefore it is my opinion that we should not put obstacles in the way of and annoy and disturb those of the Gentiles who turn to God, -- acts 15:19
.
But we should send word to them in writing to abstain from and avoid anything that has been polluted by being offered to idols, and all sexual impurity, and [eating meat of animals] that have been strangled, and [tasting of] blood. -- acts 15:20
.
For from ancient generations Moses has had his preachers in every town, for he is read [aloud] every Sabbath in the synagogues. -- acts 15:21
.
Then the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, resolved to select men from among their number and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, [both] leading men among the brethren, and sent them. -- acts 15:22
.
With [them they sent] the following letter: The brethren, both the apostles and the elders, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings: -- acts 15:23
.
As we have heard that some persons from our number have disturbed you with their teaching, unsettling your minds and throwing you into confusion, although we gave them no express orders or instructions [on the points in question], -- acts 15:24
.
It has been resolved by us in assembly to select men and send them [as messengers] to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, -- acts 15:25
.
Men who have hazarded their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- acts 15:26
.
So we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will bring you the same message by word of mouth. -- acts 15:27
.
For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to lay upon you any greater burden than these indispensable requirements: -- acts 15:28
.
That you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from [tasting] blood and from [eating the meat of animals] that have been strangled and from sexual impurity. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell [be strong]! -- acts 15:29
.
So when [the messengers] were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and having assembled the congregation, they delivered the letter. -- acts 15:30
.
And when they read it, the people rejoiced at the consolation and encouragement [it brought them]. -- acts 15:31
.
And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets (inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God), urged and warned and consoled and encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them. -- acts 15:32
.
And after spending some time there, they were sent back by the brethren with [the greeting] peace to those who had sent them. -- acts 15:33
.
However, Silas decided to stay on there. -- acts 15:34
.
But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch and with many others also continued teaching and proclaiming the good news, the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in God's kingdom]. -- acts 15:35
.
And after some time Paul said to Barnabas, Come, let us go back and again visit and help and minister to the brethren in every town where we made known the message of the Lord, and see how they are getting along. -- acts 15:36
.
Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark [his near relative]. -- acts 15:37
.
But Paul did not think it best to have along with them the one who had quit and deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work. -- acts 15:38
.
And there followed a sharp disagreement between them, so that they separated from each other, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus. -- acts 15:39
.
But Paul selected Silas and set out, being commended by the brethren to the grace (the favor and mercy) of the Lord. -- acts 15:40
.
And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, establishing and strengthening the churches. -- acts 15:41
.
AND [Paul] went down to Derbe and also to Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer [she had become convinced that Jesus is the Messiah and the Author of eternal salvation, and yielded obedience to Him]; but [Timothy's] father was a Greek. -- acts 16:1
.
He [Timothy] had a good reputation among the brethren at Lystra and Iconium. -- acts 16:2
.
Paul desired Timothy to go with him [as a missionary]; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, all of whom knew that his father was a Greek. -- acts 16:3
.
As they went on their way from town to town, they delivered over [to the assemblies] for their observance the regulations decided upon by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem. -- acts 16:4
.
So the churches were strengthened and made firm in the faith, and they increased in number day after day. -- acts 16:5
.
And Paul and Silas passed through the territory of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the Word in [the province of] Asia. -- acts 16:6
.
And when they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. -- acts 16:7
.
So passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. -- acts 16:8
.
[There] a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man from Macedonia stood pleading with him and saying, Come over to Macedonia and help us! -- acts 16:9
.
And when he had seen the vision, we [including Luke] at once endeavored to go on into Macedonia, confidently inferring that God had called us to proclaim the glad tidings (Gospel) to them. -- acts 16:10
.
Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came in a direct course to Samothrace, and the next day went on to Neapolis. -- acts 16:11
.
And from there [we came] to Philippi, which is the chief city of the district of Macedonia and a [Roman] colony. We stayed on in this place some days; -- acts 16:12
.
And on the Sabbath day we went outside the [city's] gate to the bank of the river where we supposed there was an [accustomed] place of prayer, and we sat down and addressed the women who had assembled there. -- acts 16:13
.
One of those who listened to us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a dealer in fabrics dyed in purple. She was [already] a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. -- acts 16:14
.
And when she was baptized along with her household, she earnestly entreated us, saying, If in your opinion I am one really convinced [that Jesus is the Messiah and the Author of salvation] and that I will be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay. And she induced us [to do it]. -- acts 16:15
.
As we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who was possessed by a spirit of divination [claiming to foretell future events and to discover hidden knowledge], and she brought her owners much gain by her fortunetelling. -- acts 16:16
.
She kept following Paul and [the rest of] us, shouting loudly, These men are the servants of the Most High God! They announce to you the way of salvation! -- acts 16:17
.
And she did this for many days. Then Paul, being sorely annoyed and worn out, turned and said to the spirit within her, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! And it came out that very moment. -- acts 16:18
.
But when her owners discovered that their hope of profit was gone, they caught hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the forum (marketplace), [where trials are held]. -- acts 16:19
.
And when they had brought them before the magistrates, they declared, These fellows are Jews and they are throwing our city into great confusion. -- acts 16:20
.
They encourage the practice of customs which it is unlawful for us Romans to accept or observe! -- acts 16:21
.
The crowd [also] joined in the attack upon them, and the rulers tore the clothes off of them and commanded that they be beaten with rods. -- acts 16:22
.
And when they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely. -- acts 16:23
.
He, having received [so strict a] charge, put them into the inner prison (the dungeon) and fastened their feet in the stocks. -- acts 16:24
.
But about midnight, as Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the [other] prisoners were listening to them, -- acts 16:25
.
Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the very foundations of the prison were shaken; and at once all the doors were opened and everyone's shackles were unfastened. -- acts 16:26
.
When the jailer, startled out of his sleep, saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself, because he supposed that the prisoners had escaped. -- acts 16:27
.
But Paul shouted, Do not harm yourself, for we are all here! -- acts 16:28
.
Then [the jailer] called for lights and rushed in, and trembling and terrified he fell down before Paul and Silas. -- acts 16:29
.
And he brought them out [of the dungeon] and said, Men, what is it necessary for me to do that I may be saved? -- acts 16:30
.
And they answered, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ [give yourself up to Him, take yourself out of your own keeping and entrust yourself into His keeping] and you will be saved, [and this applies both to] you and your household as well. -- acts 16:31
.
And they declared the Word of the Lord [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] to him and to all who were in his house. -- acts 16:32
.
And he took them the same hour of the night and bathed [them because of their bloody] wounds, and he was baptized immediately and all [the members of] his [household]. -- acts 16:33
.
Then he took them up into his house and set food before them; and he leaped much for joy and exulted with all his family that he believed in God [accepting and joyously welcoming what He had made known through Christ]. -- acts 16:34
.
But when it was day, the magistrates sent policemen, saying, Release those fellows and let them go. -- acts 16:35
.
And the jailer repeated the words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to release you and let you go; now therefore come out and go in peace. -- acts 16:36
.
But Paul answered them, They have beaten us openly and publicly, without a trial and uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now thrust us out secretly? No, indeed! Let them come here themselves and conduct us out! -- acts 16:37
.
The police reported this message to the magistrates, and they were frightened when they heard that the prisoners were Roman citizens; -- acts 16:38
.
So they came themselves and [striving to appease them by entreaty] apologized to them. And they brought them out and asked them to leave the city. -- acts 16:39
.
So [Paul and Silas] left the prison and went to Lydia's house; and when they had seen the brethren, they warned and urged and consoled and encouraged them and departed. -- acts 16:40
.
NOW AFTER [Paul and Silas] had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. -- acts 17:1
.
And Paul entered, as he usually did, and for three Sabbaths he reasoned and argued with them from the Scriptures, -- acts 17:2
.
Explaining [them] and [quoting passages] setting forth and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, This Jesus, Whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ (the Messiah). -- acts 17:3
.
And some of them [accordingly] were induced to believe and associated themselves with Paul and Silas, as did a great number of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. -- acts 17:4
.
But the unbelieving Jews were aroused to jealousy, and, getting hold of some wicked men (ruffians and rascals) and loungers in the marketplace, they gathered together a mob, set the town in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring [Paul and Silas] out to the people. -- acts 17:5
.
But when they failed to find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities, crying, These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, -- acts 17:6
.
And Jason has received them to his house and privately protected them! And they are all ignoring and acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, [actually] asserting that there is another king, one Jesus! -- acts 17:7
.
And both the crowd and the city authorities, on hearing this, were irritated (stirred up and troubled). -- acts 17:8
.
And when they had taken security [bail] from Jason and the others, they let them go. -- acts 17:9
.
Now the brethren at once sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea; and when they arrived, they entered the synagogue of the Jews. -- acts 17:10
.
Now these [Jews] were better disposed and more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they were entirely ready and accepted and welcomed the message [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] with inclination of mind and eagerness, searching and examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. -- acts 17:11
.
Many of them therefore became believers, together with not a few prominent Greeks, women as well as men. -- acts 17:12
.
But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] was also preached by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, disturbing and inciting the masses. -- acts 17:13
.
At once the brethren sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained behind. -- acts 17:14
.
Those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving instructions for Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible, they departed. -- acts 17:15
.
Now while Paul was awaiting them at Athens, his spirit was grieved and roused to anger as he saw that the city was full of idols. -- acts 17:16
.
So he reasoned and argued in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshiped there, and in the marketplace [where assemblies are held] day after day with any who chanced to be there. -- acts 17:17
.
And some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him and began to engage in discussion. And some said, What is this babbler with his scrap-heap learning trying to say? Others said, He seems to be an announcer of foreign deities--because he preached Jesus and the resurrection. -- acts 17:18
.
And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus [Mars Hill meeting place], saying, May we know what this novel (unheard of and unprecedented) teaching is which you are openly declaring? -- acts 17:19
.
For you set forth some startling things, foreign and strange to our ears; we wish to know therefore just what these things mean-- -- acts 17:20
.
For the Athenians, all of them, and the foreign residents and visitors among them spent all their leisure time in nothing except telling or hearing something newer than the last-- -- acts 17:21
.
So Paul, standing in the center of the Areopagus [Mars Hill meeting place], said: Men of Athens, I perceive in every way [on every hand and with every turn I make] that you are most religious or very reverent to demons. -- acts 17:22
.
For as I passed along and carefully observed your objects of worship, I came also upon an altar with this inscription, To the unknown god. Now what you are already worshiping as unknown, this I set forth to you. -- acts 17:23
.
The God Who produced and formed the world and all things in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade shrines. -- acts 17:24
.
Neither is He served by human hands, as though He lacked anything, for it is He Himself Who gives life and breath and all things to all [people]. -- acts 17:25
.
And He made from one [common origin, one source, one blood] all nations of men to settle on the face of the earth, having definitely determined [their] allotted periods of time and the fixed boundaries of their habitation (their settlements, lands, and abodes), -- acts 17:26
.
So that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after Him and find Him, although He is not far from each one of us. -- acts 17:27
.
For in Him we live and move and have our being; as even some of your [own] poets have said, For we are also His offspring. -- acts 17:28
.
Since then we are God's offspring, we ought not to suppose that Deity (the Godhead) is like gold or silver or stone, [of the nature of] a representation by human art and imagination, or anything constructed or invented. -- acts 17:29
.
Such [former] ages of ignorance God, it is true, ignored and allowed to pass unnoticed; but now He charges all people everywhere to repent (to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways, with abhorrence of their past sins), -- acts 17:30
.
Because He has fixed a day when He will judge the world righteously (justly) by a Man Whom He has destined and appointed for that task, and He has made this credible and given conviction and assurance and evidence to everyone by raising Him from the dead. -- acts 17:31
.
Now when they had heard [that there had been] a resurrection from the dead, some scoffed; but others said, We will hear you again about this matter. -- acts 17:32
.
So Paul went out from among them. -- acts 17:33
.
But some men were on his side and joined him and believed (became Christians); among them were Dionysius, a judge of the Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris, and some others with them. -- acts 17:34
.
AFTER THIS [Paul] departed from Athens and went to Corinth. -- acts 18:1
.
There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently arrived from Italy with Priscilla his wife, due to the fact that Claudius had issued an edict that all the Jews were to leave Rome. And [Paul] went to see them, -- acts 18:2
.
And because he was of the same occupation, he stayed with them; and they worked [together], for they were tentmakers by trade. -- acts 18:3
.
But he discoursed and argued in the synagogue every Sabbath and won over [both] Jews and Greeks. -- acts 18:4
.
By the time Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was completely engrossed with preaching, earnestly arguing and testifying to the Jews that Jesus [is] the Christ. -- acts 18:5
.
But since they kept opposing and abusing and reviling him, he shook out his clothing [against them] and said to them, Your blood be upon your [own] heads! I am innocent [of it]. From now on I will go to the Gentiles (the heathen). -- acts 18:6
.
He then left there and went to the house of a man named Titus Justus, who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue. -- acts 18:7
.
But Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed [that Jesus is the Messiah and acknowledged Him with joyful trust as Savior and Lord], together with his entire household; and many of the Corinthians who listened [to Paul also] believed and were baptized. -- acts 18:8
.
And one night the Lord said to Paul in a vision, Have no fear, but speak and do not keep silent; -- acts 18:9
.
For I am with you, and no man shall assault you to harm you, for I have many people in this city. -- acts 18:10
.
So he settled down among them for a year and six months, teaching the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God]. -- acts 18:11
.
But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia (most of Greece), the Jews unitedly made an attack upon Paul and brought him before the judge's seat, -- acts 18:12
.
Declaring, This fellow is advising and inducing and inciting people to worship God in violation of the Law [of Rome and of Moses]. -- acts 18:13
.
But when Paul was about to open his mouth to reply, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of some misdemeanor or villainy, O Jews, I should have cause to bear with you and listen; -- acts 18:14
.
But since it is merely a question [of doctrine] about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I decline to be a judge of such matters and I have no intention of trying such cases. -- acts 18:15
.
And he drove them away from the judgment seat. -- acts 18:16
.
Then they [the Greeks] all seized Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him right in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this. -- acts 18:17
.
Afterward Paul remained many days longer, and then told the brethren farewell and sailed for Syria; and he was accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he [Paul] cut his hair, for he had made a vow. -- acts 18:18
.
Then they arrived in Ephesus, and [Paul] left the others there; but he himself entered the synagogue and discoursed and argued with the Jews. -- acts 18:19
.
When they asked him to remain for a longer time, he would not consent; -- acts 18:20
.
But when he was leaving them he said, I will return to you if God is willing, and he set sail from Ephesus. -- acts 18:21
.
When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church [at Jerusalem], and then went down to Antioch. -- acts 18:22
.
After staying there some time, he left and went from place to place in an orderly journey through the territory of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing the disciples and imparting new strength to them. -- acts 18:23
.
Meanwhile, there was a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, who came to Ephesus. He was a cultured and eloquent man, well versed and mighty in the Scriptures. -- acts 18:24
.
He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and burning with spiritual zeal, he spoke and taught diligently and accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he was acquainted only with the baptism of John. -- acts 18:25
.
He began to speak freely (fearlessly and boldly) in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him with them and expounded to him the way of God more definitely and accurately. -- acts 18:26
.
And when [Apollos] wished to cross to Achaia (most of Greece), the brethren wrote to the disciples there, urging and encouraging them to accept and welcome him heartily. When he arrived, he proved a great help to those who through grace (God's unmerited favor and mercy) had believed (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Christ as Lord and Savior). -- acts 18:27
.
For with great power he refuted the Jews in public [discussions], showing and proving by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah). -- acts 18:28
.
WHILE APOLLOS was in Corinth, Paul went through the upper inland districts and came down to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. -- acts 19:1
.
And he asked them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed [on Jesus as the Christ]? And they said, No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit. -- acts 19:2
.
And he asked, Into what [baptism] then were you baptized? They said, Into John's baptism. -- acts 19:3
.
And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, continually telling the people that they should believe in the One Who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus [having a conviction full of joyful trust that He is Christ, the Messiah, and being obedient to Him]. -- acts 19:4
.
On hearing this they were baptized [again, this time] in the name of the Lord Jesus. -- acts 19:5
.
And as Paul laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke in [foreign, unknown] tongues (languages) and prophesied. -- acts 19:6
.
There were about twelve of them in all. -- acts 19:7
.
And he went into the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, persuading and arguing and pleading about the kingdom of God. -- acts 19:8
.
But when some became more and more stubborn (hardened and unbelieving), discrediting and reviling and speaking evil of the Way [of the Lord] before the congregation, he separated himself from them, taking the disciples with him, and went on holding daily discussions in the lecture room of Tyrannus from about ten o'clock till three. -- acts 19:9
.
This continued for two years, so that all the inhabitants of [the province of] Asia, Jews as well as Greeks, heard the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God]. -- acts 19:10
.
And God did unusual and extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, -- acts 19:11
.
So that handkerchiefs or towels or aprons which had touched his skin were carried away and put upon the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. -- acts 19:12
.
Then some of the traveling Jewish exorcists (men who adjure evil spirits) also undertook to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, I solemnly implore and charge you by the Jesus Whom Paul preaches! -- acts 19:13
.
Seven sons of a certain Jewish chief priest named Sceva were doing this. -- acts 19:14
.
But [one] evil spirit retorted, Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you? -- acts 19:15
.
Then the man in whom the evil spirit dwelt leaped upon them, mastering two of them, and was so violent against them that they dashed out of that house [in fear], stripped naked and wounded. -- acts 19:16
.
This became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and alarm and terror fell upon them all; and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled and magnified. -- acts 19:17
.
Many also of those who were now believers came making full confession and thoroughly exposing their [former deceptive and evil] practices. -- acts 19:18
.
And many of those who had practiced curious, magical arts collected their books and [throwing them, book after book, on the pile] burned them in the sight of everybody. When they counted the value of them, they found it amounted to 50,pieces of silver (about $9,300). -- acts 19:19
.
Thus the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] grew and spread and intensified, prevailing mightily. -- acts 19:20
.
Now after these events Paul determined in the [Holy] Spirit that he would travel through Macedonia and Achaia (most of Greece) and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must visit Rome also. -- acts 19:21
.
And having sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself stayed on in [the province of] Asia for a while. -- acts 19:22
.
But as time went on, there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way [of the Lord]. -- acts 19:23
.
For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of [the goddess] Artemis [Diana], brought no small income to his craftsmen. -- acts 19:24
.
These he called together, along with the workmen of similar trades, and said, Men, you are acquainted with the facts and understand that from this business we derive our wealth and livelihood. -- acts 19:25
.
Now you notice and hear that not only at Ephesus but almost all over [the province of] Asia this Paul has persuaded and induced people to believe his teaching and has alienated a considerable company of them, saying that gods that are made with human hands are not really gods at all. -- acts 19:26
.
Now there is danger not merely that this trade of ours may be discredited, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may come into disrepute and count for nothing, and that her glorious magnificence may be degraded and fall into contempt--she whom all [the province of] Asia and the wide world worship. -- acts 19:27
.
As they listened to this, they were filled with rage and they continued to shout, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians! -- acts 19:28
.
Then the city was filled with confusion; and they rushed together into the amphitheater, dragging along with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were fellow travelers with Paul. -- acts 19:29
.
Paul wished to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not permit him to do it. -- acts 19:30
.
Even some of the Asiarchs (political or religious officials in Asia) who were his friends also sent to him and warned him not to risk venturing into the theater. -- acts 19:31
.
Now some shouted one thing and some another, for the gathering was in a tumult and most of them did not know why they had come together. -- acts 19:32
.
Some of the crowd called upon Alexander [to speak], since the Jews had pushed and urged him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a defense and [planning] to apologize to the people. -- acts 19:33
.
But as soon as they saw him and recognized that he was a Jew, a shout went up from them as the voice of one man, as for about two hours they cried, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians! -- acts 19:34
.
And when the town clerk had calmed the crowd down, he said, Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the sacred stone [image of her] that fell from the sky? -- acts 19:35
.
Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet (keep yourselves in check) and do nothing rashly. -- acts 19:36
.
For you have brought these men here, who are [guilty of] neither temple robberies nor blasphemous speech about our goddess. -- acts 19:37
.
Now then, if Demetrius and his fellow tradesmen who are with him have a grievance against anyone, the courts are open and proconsuls are [available]; let them bring charges against one another [legally]. -- acts 19:38
.
But if you require anything further about this or about other matters, it must be decided and cleared up in the regular assembly. -- acts 19:39
.
For we are in danger of being called to render an account and of being accused of rioting because of [this commotion] today, there being no reason that we can offer to justify this disorder. -- acts 19:40
.
And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly. -- acts 19:41
.
AFTER THE uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and warned and consoled and urged and encouraged them; then he embraced them and told them farewell and set forth on his journey to Macedonia. -- acts 20:1
.
Then after he had gone through those districts and had warned and consoled and urged and encouraged the brethren with much discourse, he came to Greece. -- acts 20:2
.
Having spent three months there, when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he resolved to go back through Macedonia. -- acts 20:3
.
He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus from Beroea, and by the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy, and the Asians Tychicus and Trophimus. -- acts 20:4
.
These went on ahead and were waiting for us [including Luke] at Troas, -- acts 20:5
.
But we [ourselves] sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread [the Passover week], and in five days we joined them at Troas, where we remained for seven days. -- acts 20:6
.
And on the first day of the week, when we were assembled together to break bread [the Lord's Supper], Paul discoursed with them, intending to leave the next morning; and he kept on with his message until midnight. -- acts 20:7
.
Now there were numerous lights in the upper room where we were assembled, -- acts 20:8
.
And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window. He was borne down with deep sleep as Paul kept on talking still longer, and [finally] completely overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead. -- acts 20:9
.
But Paul went down and bent over him and embraced him, saying, Make no ado; his life is within him. -- acts 20:10
.
When Paul had gone back upstairs and had broken bread and eaten [with them], and after he had talked confidentially and communed with them for a considerable time--until daybreak [in fact]--he departed. -- acts 20:11
.
They took the youth home alive, and were not a little comforted and cheered and refreshed and encouraged. -- acts 20:12
.
But going on ahead to the ship, the rest of us set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for that was what he had directed, intending himself to go by land [on foot]. -- acts 20:13
.
So when he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and sailed on to Mitylene. -- acts 20:14
.
And sailing from there, we arrived the day after at a point opposite Chios; the following day we struck across to Samos, and the next day we arrived at Miletus. -- acts 20:15
.
For Paul had determined to sail on past Ephesus, lest he might have to spend time [unnecessarily] in [the province of] Asia; for he was hastening on so that he might reach Jerusalem, if at all possible, by the day of Pentecost. -- acts 20:16
.
However, from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church [to come to him there]. -- acts 20:17
.
And when they arrived he said to them: You yourselves are well acquainted with my manner of living among you from the first day that I set foot in [the province of] Asia, and how I continued afterward, -- acts 20:18
.
Serving the Lord with all humility in tears and in the midst of adversity (affliction and trials) which befell me, due to the plots of the Jews [against me]; -- acts 20:19
.
How I did not shrink from telling you anything that was for your benefit and teaching you in public meetings and from house to house, -- acts 20:20
.
But constantly and earnestly I bore testimony both to Jews and Greeks, urging them to turn in repentance [that is due] to God and to have faith in our Lord Jesus Christ [that is due Him]. -- acts 20:21
.
And now, you see, I am going to Jerusalem, bound by the [Holy] Spirit and obligated and compelled by the [convictions of my own] spirit, not knowing what will befall me there-- -- acts 20:22
.
Except that the Holy Spirit clearly and emphatically affirms to me in city after city that imprisonment and suffering await me. -- acts 20:23
.
But none of these things move me; neither do I esteem my life dear to myself, if only I may finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have obtained from [which was entrusted to me by] the Lord Jesus, faithfully to attest to the good news (Gospel) of God's grace (His unmerited favor, spiritual blessing, and mercy). -- acts 20:24
.
And now, observe, I perceive that all of you, among whom I have gone in and out proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more. -- acts 20:25
.
Therefore I testify and protest to you on this [our parting] day that I am clean and innocent and not responsible for the blood of any of you. -- acts 20:26
.
For I never shrank or kept back or fell short from declaring to you the whole purpose and plan and counsel of God. -- acts 20:27
.
Take care and be on guard for yourselves and the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has appointed you bishops and guardians, to shepherd (tend and feed and guide) the church of the Lord or of God which He obtained for Himself [buying it and saving it for Himself] with His own blood. -- acts 20:28
.
I know that after I am gone, ferocious wolves will get in among you, not sparing the flock; -- acts 20:29
.
Even from among your own selves men will come to the front who, by saying perverse (distorted and corrupt) things, will endeavor to draw away the disciples after them [to their own party]. -- acts 20:30
.
Therefore be always alert and on your guard, being mindful that for three years I never stopped night or day seriously to admonish and advise and exhort you one by one with tears. -- acts 20:31
.
And now [brethren], I commit you to God [I deposit you in His charge, entrusting you to His protection and care]. And I commend you to the Word of His grace [to the commands and counsels and promises of His unmerited favor]. It is able to build you up and to give you [your rightful] inheritance among all God's set-apart ones (those consecrated, purified, and transformed of soul). -- acts 20:32
.
I coveted no man's silver or gold or [costly] garments. -- acts 20:33
.
You yourselves know personally that these hands ministered to my own needs and those [of the persons] who were with me. -- acts 20:34
.
In everything I have pointed out to you [by example] that, by working diligently in this manner, we ought to assist the weak, being mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus, how He Himself said, It is more blessed (makes one happier and more to be envied) to give than to receive. -- acts 20:35
.
Having spoken thus, he knelt down with them all and prayed. -- acts 20:36
.
And they all wept freely and threw their arms around Paul's neck and kissed him fervently and repeatedly, -- acts 20:37
.
Being especially distressed and sorrowful because he had stated that they were about to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship. -- acts 20:38
.
AND WHEN we had torn ourselves away from them and withdrawn, we set sail and made a straight run to Cos, and on the following [day came] to Rhodes and from there to Patara. -- acts 21:1
.
There we found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia; so we went aboard and sailed away. -- acts 21:2
.
After we had sighted Cyprus, leaving it on our left we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo. -- acts 21:3
.
And having looked up the disciples there, we remained with them for seven days. Prompted by the [Holy] Spirit, they kept telling Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem. -- acts 21:4
.
But when our time there was ended, we left and proceeded on our journey; and all of them with their wives and children accompanied us on our way till we were outside the city. There we knelt down on the beach and prayed. -- acts 21:5
.
Then when we had told one another farewell, we went on board the ship, and they returned to their own homes. -- acts 21:6
.
When we had completed the voyage from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, where we paid our respects to the brethren and remained with them for one day. -- acts 21:7
.
On the morrow we left there and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven [first deacons], and stayed with him. -- acts 21:8
.
And he had four maiden daughters who had the gift of prophecy. -- acts 21:9
.
While we were remaining there for some time, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. -- acts 21:10
.
And coming to [see] us, he took Paul's belt and with it bound his own feet and hands and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit: The Jews at Jerusalem shall bind like this the man who owns this belt, and they shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles (heathen). -- acts 21:11
.
When we heard this, both we and the residents of that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem. -- acts 21:12
.
Then Paul replied, What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart like this? For I hold myself in readiness not only to be arrested and bound and imprisoned at Jerusalem, but also [even] to die for the name of the Lord Jesus. -- acts 21:13
.
And when he would not yield to [our] persuading, we stopped [urging and imploring him], saying, The Lord's will be done! -- acts 21:14
.
After these days we packed our baggage and went up to Jerusalem. -- acts 21:15
.
And some of the disciples from Caesarea came with us, conducting us to the house of Mnason, a man from Cyprus, one of the disciples of long standing, with whom we were to lodge. -- acts 21:16
.
When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received and welcomed us gladly. -- acts 21:17
.
On the next day Paul went in with us to [see] James, and all the elders of the church were present [also]. -- acts 21:18
.
After saluting them, Paul gave a detailed account of the things God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. -- acts 21:19
.
And upon hearing it, they adored and exalted and praised and thanked God. And they said to [Paul], You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and all of them are enthusiastic upholders of the [Mosaic] Law. -- acts 21:20
.
Now they have been informed about you that you continually teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn back from and forsake Moses, advising them not to circumcise their children or pay any attention to the observance of the [Mosaic] customs. -- acts 21:21
.
What then [is best that] should be done? A multitude will come together, for they will surely hear that you have arrived. -- acts 21:22
.
Therefore do just what we tell you. With us are four men who have taken a vow upon themselves. -- acts 21:23
.
Take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses [for the temple offering], so that they may have their heads shaved. Thus everybody will know that there is no truth in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself walk in observance of the Law. -- acts 21:24
.
But with regard to the Gentiles who have believed (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Christ), we have sent them a letter with our decision that they should keep themselves free from anything that has been sacrificed to idols and from [tasting] blood and [eating the meat of animals] which have been strangled and from all impurity and sexual immorality. -- acts 21:25
.
Then Paul took the [four] men with him and the following day [he went through the rites of] purifying himself along with them. And they entered the temple to give notice when the days of purification (the ending of each vow) would be fulfilled and the usual offering could be presented on behalf of each of them. -- acts 21:26
.
When the seven days were drawing to a close, some of the Jews from [the province of] Asia, who had caught sight of Paul in the temple, incited all the rabble and laid hands on him, -- acts 21:27
.
Shouting, Men of Israel, help! [Help!] This is the man who is teaching everybody everywhere against the people and the Law and this place! Moreover, he has also [actually] brought Greeks into the temple; he has desecrated and polluted this holy place! -- acts 21:28
.
For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and they supposed that he had brought the man into the temple [into the inner court forbidden to Gentiles]. -- acts 21:29
.
Then the whole city was aroused and thrown into confusion, and the people rushed together; they laid hands on Paul and dragged him outside the temple, and immediately the gates were closed. -- acts 21:30
.
Now while they were trying to kill him, word came to the commandant of the regular Roman garrison that the whole of Jerusalem was in a state of ferment. -- acts 21:31
.
So immediately he took soldiers and centurions and hurried down among them; and when the people saw the commandant and the troops, they stopped beating Paul. -- acts 21:32
.
Then the commandant approached and arrested Paul and ordered that he be secured with two chains. He then inquired who he was and what he had done. -- acts 21:33
.
Some in the crowd kept shouting back one thing and others something else, and since he could not ascertain the facts because of the furor, he ordered that Paul be removed to the barracks. -- acts 21:34
.
And when [Paul] came to mount the steps, he was actually being carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob; -- acts 21:35
.
For the mass of the people kept following them, shouting, Away with him! [Kill him!] -- acts 21:36
.
Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he asked the commandant, May I say something to you? And the man replied, Can you speak Greek? -- acts 21:37
.
Are you not then [as I supposed] the Egyptian who not long ago stirred up a rebellion and led those 4,men who were cutthroats out into the wilderness (desert)? -- acts 21:38
.
Paul answered, I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant or undistinguished city. I beg you, allow me to address the people. -- acts 21:39
.
And when the man had granted him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, gestured with his hand to the people; and there was a great hush. Then he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying: -- acts 21:40
.
BRETHREN AND fathers, listen to the defense which I now make in your presence. -- acts 22:1
.
And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they were all the more quiet. And he continued, -- acts 22:2
.
I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia but reared in this city. At the feet of Gamaliel I was educated according to the strictest care in the Law of our fathers, being ardent [even a zealot] for God, as all of you are today. -- acts 22:3
.
[Yes] I harassed (troubled, molested, and persecuted) this Way [of the Lord] to the death, putting in chains and committing to prison both men and women, -- acts 22:4
.
As the high priest and whole council of elders (Sanhedrin) can testify; for from them indeed I received letters with which I was on my way to the brethren in Damascus in order to take also those [believers] who were there, and bring them in chains to Jerusalem that they might be punished. -- acts 22:5
.
But as I was on my journey and approached Damascus, about noon a great blaze of light flashed suddenly from heaven and shone about me. -- acts 22:6
.
And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me [harass and trouble and molest Me]? -- acts 22:7
.
And I replied, Who are You, Lord? And He said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, Whom you are persecuting. -- acts 22:8
.
Now the men who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear [the sound of the uttered words of] the voice of the One Who was speaking to me [so that they could understand it]. -- acts 22:9
.
And I asked, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord answered me, Get up and go into Damascus, and there it will be told you all that it is destined and appointed for you to do. -- acts 22:10
.
And since I could not see because [of the dazzlingly glorious intensity] of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and [thus] I arrived in Damascus. -- acts 22:11
.
And one Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, well spoken of by all the Jews who resided there, -- acts 22:12
.
Came to see me, and standing by my side said to me, Brother Saul, look up and receive back your sight. And in that very instant I [recovered my sight and] looking up saw him. -- acts 22:13
.
And he said, The God of our forefathers has destined and appointed you to come progressively to know His will [to perceive, to recognize more strongly and clearly, and to become better and more intimately acquainted with His will], and to see the Righteous One (Jesus Christ, the Messiah), and to hear a voice from His [own] mouth and a message from His [own] lips; -- acts 22:14
.
For you will be His witness unto all men of everything that you have seen and heard. -- acts 22:15
.
And now, why do you delay? Rise and be baptized, and by calling upon His name, wash away your sins. -- acts 22:16
.
Then when I had come back to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple [enclosure], I fell into a trance (an ecstasy); -- acts 22:17
.
And I saw Him as He said to me, Hurry, get quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive your testimony about Me. -- acts 22:18
.
And I said, Lord, they themselves well know that throughout all the synagogues I cast into prison and flogged those who believed on (adhered to and trusted in and relied on) You. -- acts 22:19
.
And when the blood of Your witness (martyr) Stephen was shed, I also was personally standing by and consenting and approving and guarding the garments of those who slew him. -- acts 22:20
.
And the Lord said to me, Go, for I will send you far away unto the Gentiles (nations). -- acts 22:21
.
Up to the moment that Paul made this last statement, the people listened to him; but now they raised their voices and shouted, Away with such a fellow from the earth! He is not fit to live! -- acts 22:22
.
And as they were shouting and tossing and waving their garments and throwing dust into the air, -- acts 22:23
.
The commandant ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks, and that he be examined by scourging in order that [the commandant] might learn why the people cried out thus against him. -- acts 22:24
.
But when they had stretched him out with the thongs (leather straps), Paul asked the centurion who was standing by, Is it legal for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned [without a trial]? -- acts 22:25
.
When the centurion heard that, he went to the commandant and said to him, What are you about to do? This man is a Roman citizen! -- acts 22:26
.
So the commandant came and said to [Paul], Tell me, are you a Roman citizen? And he said, Yes [indeed]! -- acts 22:27
.
The commandant replied, I purchased this citizenship [as a capital investment] for a big price. Paul said, But I was born [Roman]! -- acts 22:28
.
Instantly those who were about to examine and flog him withdrew from him; and the commandant also was frightened, for he realized that [Paul] was a Roman citizen and he had put him in chains. -- acts 22:29
.
But the next day, desiring to know the real cause for which the Jews accused him, he unbound him and ordered the chief priests and all the council (Sanhedrin) to assemble; and he brought Paul down and placed him before them. -- acts 22:30
.
THEN PAUL, gazing earnestly at the council (Sanhedrin), said, Brethren, I have lived before God, doing my duty with a perfectly good conscience until this very day [as a citizen, a true and loyal Jew]. -- acts 23:1
.
At this the high priest Ananias ordered those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth. -- acts 23:2
.
Then Paul said to him, God is about to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit as a judge to try me in accordance with the Law, and yet in defiance of the Law you order me to be struck? -- acts 23:3
.
Those who stood near exclaimed, Do you rail at and insult the high priest of God? -- acts 23:4
.
And Paul said, I was not conscious, brethren, that he was a high priest; for the Scripture says, You shall not speak ill of a ruler of your people. -- acts 23:5
.
But Paul, when he perceived that one part of them were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, cried out to the council (Sanhedrin), Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; it is with regard to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am indicted and being judged. -- acts 23:6
.
So when he had said this, an angry dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the whole [crowded] assemblage was divided [into two factions]. -- acts 23:7
.
For the Sadducees hold that there is no resurrection, nor angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees declare openly and speak out freely, acknowledging [their belief in] them both. -- acts 23:8
.
Then a great uproar ensued, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and thoroughly fought the case, [contending fiercely] and declaring, We find nothing evil or wrong in this man. But if a spirit or an angel [really] spoke to him--? Let us not fight against God! -- acts 23:9
.
And when the strife became more and more tense and violent, the commandant, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, ordered the troops to go down and take him forcibly from among them and conduct him back into the barracks. -- acts 23:10
.
And [that same] following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, Take courage, Paul, for as you have borne faithful witness concerning Me at Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at Rome. -- acts 23:11
.
Now when daylight came, the Jews formed a plot and bound themselves by an oath and under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they had done away with Paul. -- acts 23:12
.
There were more than forty [men of them], who formed this conspiracy [swearing together this oath and curse]. -- acts 23:13
.
And they went to the chief priests and elders, saying, We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath and under a curse not to taste any food until we have slain Paul. -- acts 23:14
.
So now you, along with the council (Sanhedrin), give notice to the commandant to bring [Paul] down to you, as if you were going to investigate his case more accurately. But we [ourselves] are ready to slay him before he comes near. -- acts 23:15
.
But the son of Paul's sister heard of their intended attack, and he went and got into the barracks and told Paul. -- acts 23:16
.
Then Paul, calling in one of the centurions, said, Take this young man to the commandant, for he has something to report to him. -- acts 23:17
.
So he took him and conducted him to the commandant and said, Paul the prisoner called me to him and requested me to conduct this young man to you, for he has something to report to you. -- acts 23:18
.
The commandant took him by the hand, and going aside with him, asked privately, What is it that you have to report to me? -- acts 23:19
.
And he replied, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council (Sanhedrin) tomorrow, as if [they were] intending to examine him more exactly. -- acts 23:20
.
But do not yield to their persuasion, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush waiting for him, having bound themselves by an oath and under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him; and even now they are all ready, [just] waiting for your promise. -- acts 23:21
.
So the commandant sent the youth away, charging him, Do not disclose to anyone that you have given me this information. -- acts 23:22
.
Then summoning two of the centurions, he said, Have two hundred footmen ready by the third hour of the night (about 9:p.m.) to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen. -- acts 23:23
.
Also provide beasts for mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him in safety to Felix the governor. -- acts 23:24
.
And he wrote a letter having this message: -- acts 23:25
.
Claudius Lysias sends greetings to His Excellency Felix the governor. -- acts 23:26
.
This man was seized [as prisoner] by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him, because I learned that he is a Roman citizen. -- acts 23:27
.
And wishing to know the exact accusation which they were making against him, I brought him down before their council (Sanhedrin), -- acts 23:28
.
[Where] I found that he was charged in regard to questions of their own law, but he was accused of nothing that would call for death or [even] for imprisonment. -- acts 23:29
.
[However] when it was pointed out to me that there would be a conspiracy against the man, I sent him to you immediately, directing his accusers also to present before you their charge against him. -- acts 23:30
.
So the soldiers, in compliance with their instructions, took Paul and conducted him during the night to Antipatris. -- acts 23:31
.
And the next day they returned to the barracks, leaving the mounted men to proceed with him. -- acts 23:32
.
When these came to Caesarea and gave the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul before him. -- acts 23:33
.
Having read the letter, he asked to what province [Paul] belonged. When he discovered that he was from Cilicia [an imperial province], -- acts 23:34
.
He said, I will hear your case fully when your accusers also have come. And he ordered that an eye be kept on him in Herod's palace (the Praetorium). -- acts 23:35
.
FIVE DAYS later, the high priest Ananias came down [from Jerusalem to Caesarea] with some elders and a certain forensic advocate Tertullus [acting as spokesman and counsel]. They presented to the governor their evidence against Paul. -- acts 24:1
.
And when he was called, Tertullus began the complaint [against him] by saying: Since through you we obtain and enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight and provision wonderful reforms (amendments and improvements) are introduced and effected on behalf of this nation, -- acts 24:2
.
In every way and in every place, most excellent Felix, we accept and acknowledge this with deep appreciation and with all gratitude. -- acts 24:3
.
But not to hinder or detain you too long, I beg you in your clemency and courtesy and kindness to grant us a brief and concise hearing. -- acts 24:4
.
For we have found this man a perfect pest (a real plague), an agitator and source of disturbance to all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the [heretical, division-producing] sect of the Nazarenes. -- acts 24:5
.
He also [even] tried to desecrate and defile the temple, but we laid hands on him and would have sentenced him by our Law, -- acts 24:6
.
But the commandant Lysias came and took him from us with violence and force, -- acts 24:7
.
And ordered his accusers to present themselves to you. By examining and cross-questioning him yourself, you will be able to ascertain the truth from him about all these things with which we charge him. -- acts 24:8
.
The Jews also agreed and joined in the accusation, declaring that all these things were exactly so. -- acts 24:9
.
And when the governor had beckoned to Paul to speak, he answered: Because I know that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I find it easier to make my defense and do it cheerfully and with good courage. -- acts 24:10
.
As you can readily verify, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship; -- acts 24:11
.
And neither in the temple nor in the synagogues nor in the city did they find me disputing with anybody or bringing together a seditious crowd. -- acts 24:12
.
Neither can they present argument or evidence to prove to you what they now bring against me. -- acts 24:13
.
But this I confess to you, however, that in accordance with the Way [of the Lord], which they call a [heretical, division-producing] sect, I worship (serve) the God of our fathers, still persuaded of the truth of and believing in and placing full confidence in everything laid down in the Law [of Moses] or written in the prophets; -- acts 24:14
.
Having [the same] hope in God which these themselves hold and look for, that there is to be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous (the just and the unjust). -- acts 24:15
.
Therefore I always exercise and discipline myself [mortifying my body, deadening my carnal affections, bodily appetites, and worldly desires, endeavoring in all respects] to have a clear (unshaken, blameless) conscience, void of offense toward God and toward men. -- acts 24:16
.
Now after several years I came up [to Jerusalem] to bring to my people contributions of charity and offerings. -- acts 24:17
.
While I was engaged in presenting these, they found me [occupied in the rites of purification] in the temple, without any crowd or uproar. But some Jews from [the province of] Asia [were there], -- acts 24:18
.
Who ought to be here before you and to present their charges, if they have anything against me. -- acts 24:19
.
Or else let these men themselves tell of what crime or wrongdoing they found me guilty when I appeared before the council (Sanhedrin), -- acts 24:20
.
Unless it be this one sentence which I cried out as I stood among them, In regard to the resurrection of the dead I am indicted and on trial before you this day! -- acts 24:21
.
But Felix, having a rather accurate understanding of the Way [of the Lord], put them off and adjourned the trial, saying, When Lysias the commandant comes down, I will determine your case more fully. -- acts 24:22
.
Then he ordered the centurion to keep [Paul] in custody, but to treat him with indulgence [giving him some liberty] and not to hinder his friends from ministering to his needs and serving him. -- acts 24:23
.
Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul and listened to him [talk] about faith in Christ Jesus. -- acts 24:24
.
But as he continued to argue about uprightness, purity of life (the control of the passions), and the judgment to come, Felix became alarmed and terrified and said, Go away for the present; when I have a convenient opportunity, I will send for you. -- acts 24:25
.
At the same time he hoped to get money from Paul, for which reason he continued to send for him and was in his company and conversed with him often. -- acts 24:26
.
But when two years had gone by, Felix was succeeded in office by Porcius Festus; and wishing to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul still a prisoner in chains. -- acts 24:27
.
NOW WHEN Festus had entered into his own province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem. -- acts 25:1
.
And [there] the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid charges before him against Paul, and they kept begging and urging him, -- acts 25:2
.
Asking as a favor that he would have him brought to Jerusalem; [meanwhile] they were planning an ambush to slay him on the way. -- acts 25:3
.
Festus answered that Paul was in custody in Caesarea and that he himself planned to leave for there soon. -- acts 25:4
.
So, said he, let those who are in a position of authority and are influential among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss or criminal about the man, let them so charge him. -- acts 25:5
.
So when Festus had remained among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, took his seat the next day on the judgment bench, and ordered Paul to be brought before him. -- acts 25:6
.
And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood all around him, bringing many grave accusations against him which they were not able to prove. -- acts 25:7
.
Paul declared in [his own] defense, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in any way. -- acts 25:8
.
But Festus, wishing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, answered Paul, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be put on trial [before the Jewish Sanhedrin] in my presence concerning these charges? -- acts 25:9
.
But Paul replied, I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you know better [than your question implies]. -- acts 25:10
.
If then I am a wrongdoer and a criminal and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not beg off and seek to escape death; but if there is no ground for their accusations against me, no one can give me up and make a present of me [give me up freely] to them. I appeal to Caesar. -- acts 25:11
.
Then Festus, when he had consulted with the [men who formed his] council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go. -- acts 25:12
.
Now after an interval of some days, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus [to welcome him and wish him well]. -- acts 25:13
.
And while they remained there for many days, Festus acquainted the king with Paul's case, telling him, There is a man left a prisoner in chains by Felix; -- acts 25:14
.
And when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him, petitioning for a judicial hearing and condemnation of him. -- acts 25:15
.
But I replied to them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up freely any man for punishment before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to defend himself concerning the charge brought against him. -- acts 25:16
.
So when they came here together, I did not delay, but on the morrow took my place on the judgment seat and ordered that the man be brought before me. -- acts 25:17
.
[But] when the accusers stood up, they brought forward no accusation [in his case] of any such misconduct as I was expecting. -- acts 25:18
.
Instead they had some points of controversy with him about their own religion or superstition and concerning one Jesus, Who had died but Whom Paul kept asserting [over and over] to be alive. -- acts 25:19
.
And I, being puzzled to know how to make inquiries into such questions, asked whether he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and there be tried regarding them. -- acts 25:20
.
But when Paul had appealed to have his case retained for examination and decision by the emperor, I ordered that he be detained until I could send him to Caesar. -- acts 25:21
.
Then Agrippa said to Festus, I also desire to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, [Festus] replied, you shall hear him. -- acts 25:22
.
So the next day Agrippa and Bernice approached with great display, and they went into the audience hall accompanied by the military commandants and the prominent citizens of the city. At the order of Festus Paul was brought in. -- acts 25:23
.
Then Festus said, King Agrippa and all the men present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people came to me and complained, both at Jerusalem and here, insisting and shouting that he ought not to live any longer. -- acts 25:24
.
But I found nothing that he had done deserving of death. Still, as he himself appealed to the emperor, I determined to send him to Rome. -- acts 25:25
.
[However] I have nothing in particular and definite to write to my lord concerning him. So I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after [further] examination has been made, I may have something to put in writing. -- acts 25:26
.
For it seems to me senseless and absurd to send a prisoner and not state the accusations against him. -- acts 25:27
.
THEN AGRIPPA said to Paul, You are permitted to speak on your own behalf. At that Paul stretched forth his hand and made his defense [as follows]: -- acts 26:1
.
I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that it is before you that I am to make my defense today in regard to all the charges brought against me by [the] Jews, -- acts 26:2
.
[Especially] because you are so fully and unusually conversant with all the Jewish customs and controversies; therefore, I beg you to hear me patiently. -- acts 26:3
.
My behavior and manner of living from my youth up is known by all the Jews; [they are aware] that from [its] commencement my youth was spent among my own race in Jerusalem. -- acts 26:4
.
They have had knowledge of me for a long time, if they are willing to testify to it, that in accordance with the strictest sect of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee. -- acts 26:5
.
And now I stand here on trial [to be judged on the ground] of the hope of that promise made to our forefathers by God, -- acts 26:6
.
Which hope [of the Messiah and the resurrection] our twelve tribes confidently expect to realize as they fervently worship [without ceasing] night and day. And for that hope, O king, I am accused by Jews and considered a criminal! -- acts 26:7
.
Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead? -- acts 26:8
.
I myself indeed was [once] persuaded that it was my duty to do many things contrary to and in defiance of the name of Jesus of Nazareth. -- acts 26:9
.
And that is what I did in Jerusalem; I [not only] locked up many of the [faithful] saints (holy ones) in prison by virtue of authority received from the chief priests, but when they were being condemned to death, I cast my vote against them. -- acts 26:10
.
And frequently I punished them in all the synagogues to make them blaspheme; and in my bitter fury against them, I harassed (troubled, molested, persecuted) and pursued them even to foreign cities. -- acts 26:11
.
Thus engaged I proceeded to Damascus with the authority and orders of the chief priests, -- acts 26:12
.
When on the road at midday, O king, I saw a light from heaven surpassing the brightness of the sun, flashing about me and those who were traveling with me. -- acts 26:13
.
And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice in the Hebrew tongue saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you continue to persecute Me [to harass and trouble and molest Me]? It is dangerous and turns out badly for you to keep kicking against the goads [to keep offering vain and perilous resistance]. -- acts 26:14
.
And I said, Who are You, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, Whom you are persecuting. -- acts 26:15
.
But arise and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, that I might appoint you to serve as [My] minister and to bear witness both to what you have seen of Me and to that in which I will appear to you, -- acts 26:16
.
Choosing you out [selecting you for Myself] and delivering you from among this [Jewish] people and the Gentiles to whom I am sending you-- -- acts 26:17
.
To open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may thus receive forgiveness and release from their sins and a place and portion among those who are consecrated and purified by faith in Me. -- acts 26:18
.
Wherefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision, -- acts 26:19
.
But made known openly first of all to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout the whole land of Judea, and also among the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works and live lives consistent with and worthy of their repentance. -- acts 26:20
.
Because of these things the Jews seized me in the temple [enclosure] and tried to do away with me. -- acts 26:21
.
[But] to this day I have had the help which comes from God [as my ally], and so I stand here testifying to small and great alike, asserting nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses declared would come to pass-- -- acts 26:22
.
That the Christ (the Anointed One) must suffer and that He, by being the first to rise from the dead, would declare and show light both to the [Jewish] people and to the Gentiles. -- acts 26:23
.
And as he thus proceeded with his defense, Festus called out loudly, Paul, you are mad! Your great learning is driving you insane! -- acts 26:24
.
But Paul replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but I am uttering the straight, sound truth. -- acts 26:25
.
For the king understands about these things well enough, and [therefore] to him I speak with bold frankness and confidence. I am convinced that not one of these things has escaped his notice, for all this did not take place in a corner [in secret]. -- acts 26:26
.
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? [Do you give credence to God's messengers and their words?] I perceive and know that you do believe. -- acts 26:27
.
Then Agrippa said to Paul, You think it a small task to make a Christian of me [just offhand to induce me with little ado and persuasion, at very short notice]. -- acts 26:28
.
And Paul replied, Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you, but also all who are listening to me today, might become such as I am, except for these chains. -- acts 26:29
.
Then the king arose, and the governor and Bernice and all those who were seated with them; -- acts 26:30
.
And after they had gone out, they said to one another, This man is doing nothing deserving of death or [even] of imprisonment. -- acts 26:31
.
And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar. -- acts 26:32
.
NOW WHEN it was determined that we [including Luke] should sail for Italy, they turned Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion of the imperial regiment named Julius. -- acts 27:1
.
And going aboard a ship from Adramyttium which was about to sail for the ports along the coast of [the province of] Asia, we put out to sea; and Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, accompanied us. -- acts 27:2
.
The following day we landed at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul in a loving way, with much consideration (kindness and care), permitting him to go to his friends [there] and be refreshed and be cared for. -- acts 27:3
.
After putting to sea from there we passed to the leeward (south side) of Cyprus [for protection], for the winds were contrary to us. -- acts 27:4
.
And when we had sailed over [the whole length] of sea which lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia. -- acts 27:5
.
There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy, and he transferred us to it. -- acts 27:6
.
For a number of days we made slow progress and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus; then, as the wind did not permit us to proceed, we went under the lee (shelter) of Crete off Salmone, -- acts 27:7
.
And coasting along it with difficulty, we arrived at a place called Fair Havens, near which is located the town of Lasea. -- acts 27:8
.
But as [the season was well advanced, for] much time had been lost and navigation was already dangerous, for the time for the Fast [the Day of Atonement, about the beginning of October] had already gone by, Paul warned and advised them, -- acts 27:9
.
Saying, Sirs, I perceive [after careful observation] that this voyage will be attended with disaster and much heavy loss, not only of the cargo and the ship but of our lives also. -- acts 27:10
.
However, the centurion paid greater attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. -- acts 27:11
.
And as the harbor was not well situated and so unsuitable to winter in, the majority favored the plan of putting to sea again from there, hoping somehow to reach Phoenice, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and winter there. -- acts 27:12
.
So when the south wind blew softly, supposing they were gaining their object, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, hugging the coast. -- acts 27:13
.
But soon afterward a violent wind [of the character of a typhoon], called a northeaster, came bursting down from the island. -- acts 27:14
.
And when the ship was caught and was unable to head against the wind, we gave up and, letting her drift, were borne along. -- acts 27:15
.
We ran under the shelter of a small island called Cauda, where we managed with [much] difficulty to draw the [ship's small] boat on deck and secure it. -- acts 27:16
.
After hoisting it on board, they used supports with ropes to undergird and brace the ship; then afraid that they would be driven into the Syrtis [quicksands off the north coast of Africa], they lowered the gear (sails and ropes) and so were driven along. -- acts 27:17
.
As we were being dangerously tossed about by the violence of the storm, the next day they began to throw the freight overboard; -- acts 27:18
.
And the third day they threw out with their own hands the ship's equipment (the tackle and the furniture). -- acts 27:19
.
And when neither sun nor stars were visible for many days and no small tempest kept raging about us, all hope of our being saved was finally abandoned. -- acts 27:20
.
Then as they had eaten nothing for a long time, Paul came forward into their midst and said, Men, you should have listened to me, and should not have put to sea from Crete and brought on this disaster and harm and misery and loss. -- acts 27:21
.
But [even] now I beg you to be in good spirits and take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you but only of the ship. -- acts 27:22
.
For this [very] night there stood by my side an angel of the God to Whom I belong and Whom I serve and worship, -- acts 27:23
.
And he said, Do not be frightened, Paul! It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar; and behold, God has given you all those who are sailing with you. -- acts 27:24
.
So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith (complete confidence) in God that it will be exactly as it was told me; -- acts 27:25
.
But we shall have to be stranded on some island. -- acts 27:26
.
The fourteenth night had come and we were drifting and being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near to some land. -- acts 27:27
.
So they took soundings and found twenty fathoms, and a little farther on they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms. -- acts 27:28
.
Then fearing that we might fall off [our course] onto rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and kept wishing for daybreak to come. -- acts 27:29
.
And as the sailors were trying to escape [secretly] from the ship and were lowering the small boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow, -- acts 27:30
.
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved. -- acts 27:31
.
Then the soldiers cut away the ropes that held the small boat, and let it fall and drift away. -- acts 27:32
.
While they waited until it should become day, Paul entreated them all to take some food, saying, This is the fourteenth day that you have been continually in suspense and on the alert without food, having eaten nothing. -- acts 27:33
.
So I urge (warn, exhort, encourage, advise) you to take some food [for your safety]--it will give you strength; for not a hair is to perish from the head of any one of you. -- acts 27:34
.
Having said these words, he took bread and, giving thanks to God before them all, he broke it and began to eat. -- acts 27:35
.
Then they all became more cheerful and were encouraged and took food themselves. -- acts 27:36
.
All told there were souls of us in the ship. -- acts 27:37
.
And after they had eaten sufficiently, [they proceeded] to lighten the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. -- acts 27:38
.
Now when it was day [and they saw the land], they did not recognize it, but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they [taking counsel] purposed to run the ship ashore if they possibly could. -- acts 27:39
.
So they cut the cables and severed the anchors and left them in the sea; at the same time unlashing the ropes that held the rudders and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they headed for the beach. -- acts 27:40
.
But striking a crosscurrent (a place open to two seas) they ran the ship aground. The prow stuck fast and remained immovable, and the stern began to break up under the violent force of the waves. -- acts 27:41
.
It was the counsel of the soldiers to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim to land and escape; -- acts 27:42
.
But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their purpose. He commanded those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and make for the shore, -- acts 27:43
.
And the rest on heavy boards or pieces of the vessel. And so it was that all escaped safely to land. -- acts 27:44
.
AFTER WE were safe on the island, we knew and recognized that it was called Malta. -- acts 28:1
.
And the natives showed us unusual and remarkable kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed and received us all, since it had begun to rain and was cold. -- acts 28:2
.
Now Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and he was laying them on the fire when a viper crawled out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand. -- acts 28:3
.
When the natives saw the little animal hanging from his hand, they said to one another, Doubtless this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice [the goddess of avenging] has not permitted that he should live. -- acts 28:4
.
Then [Paul simply] shook off the small creature into the fire and suffered no evil effects. -- acts 28:5
.
However, they were waiting, expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead; but when they had watched him a long time and saw nothing fatal or harmful come to him, they changed their minds and kept saying over and over that he was a god. -- acts 28:6
.
In the vicinity of that place there were estates belonging to the head man of the island, named Publius, who accepted and welcomed and entertained us with hearty hospitality for three days. -- acts 28:7
.
And it happened that the father of Publius was sick in bed with recurring attacks of fever and dysentery; and Paul went to see him, and after praying and laying his hands on him, he healed him. -- acts 28:8
.
After this had occurred, the other people on the island who had diseases also kept coming and were cured. -- acts 28:9
.
They showed us every respect and presented many gifts to us, honoring us with many honors; and when we sailed, they provided and put on [board our ship] everything we needed. -- acts 28:10
.
It was after three months' stay there that we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian ship with the Twin Brothers [Castor and Pollux] as its figurehead. -- acts 28:11
.
We landed at Syracuse and remained there three days, -- acts 28:12
.
And from there we made a circuit [following the coast] and reached Rhegium; and one day later a south wind sprang up, and the next day we arrived at Puteoli. -- acts 28:13
.
There we found some [Christian] brethren and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. -- acts 28:14
.
And the [Christian] brethren there, having had news of us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and received new courage. -- acts 28:15
.
When we arrived at Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was permitted to live by himself with the soldier who guarded him. -- acts 28:16
.
Three days after [our arrival], he called together the leading local Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people or against the customs of our forefathers, yet I was turned over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. -- acts 28:17
.
After they had examined me, they were ready to release me because I was innocent of any offense deserving the death penalty. -- acts 28:18
.
But when the Jews protested, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, though it was not because I had any charge to make against my nation. -- acts 28:19
.
This is the reason therefore why I have begged to see you and to talk with you, since it is because of the Hope of Israel (the Messiah) that I am bound with this chain. -- acts 28:20
.
And they answered him, We have not received any letters about you from Judea, and none of the [Jewish] brethren coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you. -- acts 28:21
.
But we think it fitting and are eager to hear from you what it is that you have in mind and believe and what your opinion is, for with regard to this sect it is known to all of us that it is everywhere denounced. -- acts 28:22
.
So when they had set a day with him, they came in large numbers to his lodging. And he fully set forth and explained the matter to them from morning until night, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets. -- acts 28:23
.
And some were convinced and believed what he said, and others did not believe. -- acts 28:24
.
And as they disagreed among themselves, they began to leave, [but not before] Paul had added one statement [more]: The Holy Spirit was right in saying through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers: -- acts 28:25
.
Go to this people and say to them, You will indeed hear and hear with your ears but will not understand, and you will indeed look and look with your eyes but will not see [not perceive, have knowledge of or become acquainted with what you look at, at all]. -- acts 28:26
.
For the heart (the understanding, the soul) of this people has grown dull (stupid, hardened, and calloused), and their ears are heavy and hard of hearing and they have shut tight their eyes, so that they may not perceive and have knowledge and become acquainted with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their souls and turn [to Me and be converted], that I may heal them. -- acts 28:27
.
So let it be understood by you then that [this message of] the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen [to it]! -- acts 28:28
.
And when he had said these things, the Jews went away, arguing and disputing among themselves. -- acts 28:29
.
After this Paul lived there for two entire years [at his own expense] in his own rented lodging, and he welcomed all who came to him, -- acts 28:30
.
Preaching to them the kingdom of God and teaching them about the Lord Jesus Christ with boldness and quite openly, and without being molested or hindered. -- acts 28:31
.
FROM PAUL, a bond servant of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) called to be an apostle, (a special messenger) set apart to [preach] the Gospel (good news) of and from God, -- romans 1:1
.
Which He promised in advance [long ago] through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures-- -- romans 1:2
.
[The Gospel] regarding His Son, Who as to the flesh (His human nature) was descended from David, -- romans 1:3
.
And [as to His divine nature] according to the Spirit of holiness was openly designated the Son of God in power [in a striking, triumphant and miraculous manner] by His resurrection from the dead, even Jesus Christ our Lord (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- romans 1:4
.
It is through Him that we have received grace (God's unmerited favor) and [our] apostleship to promote obedience to the faith and make disciples for His name's sake among all the nations, -- romans 1:5
.
And this includes you, called of Jesus Christ and invited [as you are] to belong to Him. -- romans 1:6
.
To [you then] all God's beloved ones in Rome, called to be saints and designated for a consecrated life: Grace and spiritual blessing and peace be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. -- romans 1:7
.
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because [the report of] your faith is made known to all the world and is commended everywhere. -- romans 1:8
.
For God is my witness, Whom I serve with my [whole] spirit [rendering priestly and spiritual service] in [preaching] the Gospel and [telling] the good news of His Son, how incessantly I always mention you when at my prayers. -- romans 1:9
.
I keep pleading that somehow by God's will I may now at last prosper and come to you. -- romans 1:10
.
For I am yearning to see you, that I may impart and share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen and establish you; -- romans 1:11
.
That is, that we may be mutually strengthened and encouraged and comforted by each other's faith, both yours and mine. -- romans 1:12
.
I want you to know, brethren, that many times I have planned and intended to come to you, though thus far I have been hindered and prevented, in order that I might have some fruit (some result of my labors) among you, as I have among the rest of the Gentiles. -- romans 1:13
.
Both to Greeks and to barbarians (to the cultured and to the uncultured), both to the wise and the foolish, I have an obligation to discharge and a duty to perform and a debt to pay. -- romans 1:14
.
So, for my part, I am willing and eagerly ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are in Rome. -- romans 1:15
.
For I am not ashamed of the Gospel (good news) of Christ, for it is God's power working unto salvation [for deliverance from eternal death] to everyone who believes with a personal trust and a confident surrender and firm reliance, to the Jew first and also to the Greek, -- romans 1:16
.
For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed, both springing from faith and leading to faith [disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith]. As it is written, The man who through faith is just and upright shall live and shall live by faith. -- romans 1:17
.
For God's [holy] wrath and indignation are revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who in their wickedness repress and hinder the truth and make it inoperative. -- romans 1:18
.
For that which is known about God is evident to them and made plain in their inner consciousness, because God [Himself] has shown it to them. -- romans 1:19
.
For ever since the creation of the world His invisible nature and attributes, that is, His eternal power and divinity, have been made intelligible and clearly discernible in and through the things that have been made (His handiworks). So [men] are without excuse [altogether without any defense or justification], -- romans 1:20
.
Because when they knew and recognized Him as God, they did not honor and glorify Him as God or give Him thanks. But instead they became futile and godless in their thinking [with vain imaginings, foolish reasoning, and stupid speculations] and their senseless minds were darkened. -- romans 1:21
.
Claiming to be wise, they became fools [professing to be smart, they made simpletons of themselves]. -- romans 1:22
.
And by them the glory and majesty and excellence of the immortal God were exchanged for and represented by images, resembling mortal man and birds and beasts and reptiles. -- romans 1:23
.
Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their [own] hearts to sexual impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves [abandoning them to the degrading power of sin], -- romans 1:24
.
Because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, Who is blessed forever! Amen (so be it). -- romans 1:25
.
For this reason God gave them over and abandoned them to vile affections and degrading passions. For their women exchanged their natural function for an unnatural and abnormal one, -- romans 1:26
.
And the men also turned from natural relations with women and were set ablaze (burning out, consumed) with lust for one another--men committing shameful acts with men and suffering in their own bodies and personalities the inevitable consequences and penalty of their wrong-doing and going astray, which was [their] fitting retribution. -- romans 1:27
.
And so, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God or approve of Him or consider Him worth the knowing, God gave them over to a base and condemned mind to do things not proper or decent but loathsome, -- romans 1:28
.
Until they were filled (permeated and saturated) with every kind of unrighteousness, iniquity, grasping and covetous greed, and malice. [They were] full of envy and jealousy, murder, strife, deceit and treachery, ill will and cruel ways. [They were] secret backbiters and gossipers, -- romans 1:29
.
Slanderers, hateful to and hating God, full of insolence, arrogance, [and] boasting; inventors of new forms of evil, disobedient and undutiful to parents. -- romans 1:30
.
[They were] without understanding, conscienceless and faithless, heartless and loveless [and] merciless. -- romans 1:31
.
Though they are fully aware of God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do them themselves but approve and applaud others who practice them. -- romans 1:32
.
THEREFORE YOU have no excuse or defense or justification, O man, whoever you are who judges and condemns another. For in posing as judge and passing sentence on another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge are habitually practicing the very same things [that you censure and denounce]. -- romans 2:1
.
[But] we know that the judgment (adverse verdict, sentence) of God falls justly and in accordance with truth upon those who practice such things. -- romans 2:2
.
And do you think or imagine, O man, when you judge and condemn those who practice such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape God's judgment and elude His sentence and adverse verdict? -- romans 2:3
.
Or are you [so blind as to] trifle with and presume upon and despise and underestimate the wealth of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering patience? Are you unmindful or actually ignorant [of the fact] that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repent (to change your mind and inner man to accept God's will)? -- romans 2:4
.
But by your callous stubbornness and impenitence of heart you are storing up wrath and indignation for yourself on the day of wrath and indignation, when God's righteous judgment (just doom) will be revealed. -- romans 2:5
.
For He will render to every man according to his works [justly, as his deeds deserve]: -- romans 2:6
.
To those who by patient persistence in well-doing [springing from piety] seek [unseen but sure] glory and honor and [the eternal blessedness of] immortality, He will give eternal life. -- romans 2:7
.
But for those who are self-seeking and self-willed and disobedient to the Truth but responsive to wickedness, there will be indignation and wrath. -- romans 2:8
.
[And] there will be tribulation and anguish and calamity and constraint for every soul of man who [habitually] does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek (Gentile). -- romans 2:9
.
But glory and honor and [heart] peace shall be awarded to everyone who [habitually] does good, the Jew first and also the Greek (Gentile). -- romans 2:10
.
For God shows no partiality [undue favor or unfairness; with Him one man is not different from another]. -- romans 2:11
.
All who have sinned without the Law will also perish without [regard to] the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged and condemned by the Law. -- romans 2:12
.
For it is not merely hearing the Law [read] that makes one righteous before God, but it is the doers of the Law who will be held guiltless and acquitted and justified. -- romans 2:13
.
When Gentiles who have not the [divine] Law do instinctively what the Law requires, they are a law to themselves, since they do not have the Law. -- romans 2:14
.
They show that the essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts and are operating there, with which their consciences (sense of right and wrong) also bear witness; and their [moral] decisions (their arguments of reason, their condemning or approving thoughts) will accuse or perhaps defend and excuse [them] -- romans 2:15
.
On that day when, as my Gospel proclaims, God by Jesus Christ will judge men in regard to the things which they conceal (their hidden thoughts). -- romans 2:16
.
But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law and pride yourselves in God and your relationship to Him, -- romans 2:17
.
And know and understand His will and discerningly approve the better things and have a sense of what is vital, because you are instructed by the Law; -- romans 2:18
.
And if you are confident that you [yourself] are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, and [that -- romans 2:19
.
You are] a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the childish, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth-- -- romans 2:20
.
Well then, you who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you teach against stealing, do you steal (take what does not really belong to you)? -- romans 2:21
.
You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery [are you unchaste in action or in thought]? You who abhor and loathe idols, do you rob temples [do you appropriate to your own use what is consecrated to God, thus robbing the sanctuary and doing sacrilege]? -- romans 2:22
.
You who boast in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law [by stealthily infringing upon or carelessly neglecting or openly breaking it]? -- romans 2:23
.
For, as it is written, The name of God is maligned and blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you! [The words to this effect are from your own Scriptures.] -- romans 2:24
.
Circumcision does indeed profit if you keep the Law; but if you habitually transgress the Law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision. -- romans 2:25
.
So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be credited to him as [equivalent to] circumcision? -- romans 2:26
.
Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the Law will condemn you who, although you have the code in writing and have circumcision, break the Law. -- romans 2:27
.
For he is not a [real] Jew who is only one outwardly and publicly, nor is [true] circumcision something external and physical. -- romans 2:28
.
But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and [true] circumcision is of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal [matter]. His praise is not from men but from God. -- romans 2:29
.
THEN WHAT advantage remains to the Jew? [How is he favored?] Or what is the value or benefit of circumcision? -- romans 3:1
.
Much in every way. To begin with, to the Jews were entrusted the oracles (the brief communications, the intentions, the utterances) of God. -- romans 3:2
.
What if some did not believe and were without faith? Does their lack of faith and their faithlessness nullify and make ineffective and void the faithfulness of God and His fidelity [to His Word]? -- romans 3:3
.
By no means! Let God be found true though every human being is false and a liar, as it is written, That You may be justified and shown to be upright in what You say, and prevail when You are judged [by sinful men]. -- romans 3:4
.
But if our unrighteousness thus establishes and exhibits the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust and wrong to inflict His wrath upon us [Jews]? I speak in a [purely] human way. -- romans 3:5
.
By no means! Otherwise, how could God judge the world? -- romans 3:6
.
But [you say] if through my falsehood God's integrity is magnified and advertised and abounds to His glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner? -- romans 3:7
.
And why should we not do evil that good may come?--as some slanderously charge us with teaching. Such [false teaching] is justly condemned by them. -- romans 3:8
.
Well then, are we [Jews] superior and better off than they? No, not at all. We have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles), are under sin [held down by and subject to its power and control]. -- romans 3:9
.
As it is written, None is righteous, just and truthful and upright and conscientious, no, not one. -- romans 3:10
.
No one understands [no one intelligently discerns or comprehends]; no one seeks out God. -- romans 3:11
.
All have turned aside; together they have gone wrong and have become unprofitable and worthless; no one does right, not even one! -- romans 3:12
.
Their throat is a yawning grave; they use their tongues to deceive (to mislead and to deal treacherously). The venom of asps is beneath their lips. -- romans 3:13
.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. -- romans 3:14
.
Their feet are swift to shed blood. -- romans 3:15
.
Destruction [as it dashes them to pieces] and misery mark their ways. -- romans 3:16
.
And they have no experience of the way of peace [they know nothing about peace, for a peaceful way they do not even recognize]. -- romans 3:17
.
There is no [reverential] fear of God before their eyes. -- romans 3:18
.
Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that [the murmurs and excuses of] every mouth may be hushed and all the world may be held accountable to God. -- romans 3:19
.
For no person will be justified (made righteous, acquitted, and judged acceptable) in His sight by observing the works prescribed by the Law. For [the real function of] the Law is to make men recognize and be conscious of sin [not mere perception, but an acquaintance with sin which works toward repentance, faith, and holy character]. -- romans 3:20
.
But now the righteousness of God has been revealed independently and altogether apart from the Law, although actually it is attested by the Law and the Prophets, -- romans 3:21
.
Namely, the righteousness of God which comes by believing with personal trust and confident reliance on Jesus Christ (the Messiah). [And it is meant] for all who believe. For there is no distinction, -- romans 3:22
.
Since all have sinned and are falling short of the honor and glory which God bestows and receives. -- romans 3:23
.
[All] are justified and made upright and in right standing with God, freely and gratuitously by His grace (His unmerited favor and mercy), through the redemption which is [provided] in Christ Jesus, -- romans 3:24
.
Whom God put forward [before the eyes of all] as a mercy seat and propitiation by His blood [the cleansing and life-giving sacrifice of atonement and reconciliation, to be received] through faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in His divine forbearance He had passed over and ignored former sins without punishment. -- romans 3:25
.
It was to demonstrate and prove at the present time (in the now season) that He Himself is righteous and that He justifies and accepts as righteous him who has [true] faith in Jesus. -- romans 3:26
.
Then what becomes of [our] pride and [our] boasting? It is excluded (banished, ruled out entirely). On what principle? [On the principle] of doing good deeds? No, but on the principle of faith. -- romans 3:27
.
For we hold that a man is justified and made upright by faith independent of and distinctly apart from good deeds (works of the Law). [The observance of the Law has nothing to do with justification.] -- romans 3:28
.
Or is God merely [the God] of Jews? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, -- romans 3:29
.
Since it is one and the same God Who will justify the circumcised by faith [which germinated from Abraham] and the uncircumcised through their [newly acquired] faith. [For it is the same trusting faith in both cases, a firmly relying faith in Jesus Christ]. -- romans 3:30
.
Do we then by [this] faith make the Law of no effect, overthrow it or make it a dead letter? Certainly not! On the contrary, we confirm and establish and uphold the Law. -- romans 3:31
.
[BUT] IF so, what shall we say about Abraham, our forefather humanly speaking--[what did he] find out? [How does this affect his position, and what was gained by him?] -- romans 4:1
.
For if Abraham was justified (established as just by acquittal from guilt) by good works [that he did, then] he has grounds for boasting. But not before God! -- romans 4:2
.
For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed in (trusted in) God, and it was credited to his account as righteousness (right living and right standing with God). -- romans 4:3
.
Now to a laborer, his wages are not counted as a favor or a gift, but as an obligation (something owed to him). -- romans 4:4
.
But to one who, not working [by the Law], trusts (believes fully) in Him Who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited to him as righteousness (the standing acceptable to God). -- romans 4:5
.
Thus David congratulates the man and pronounces a blessing on him to whom God credits righteousness apart from the works he does: -- romans 4:6
.
Blessed and happy and to be envied are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered up and completely buried. -- romans 4:7
.
Blessed and happy and to be envied is the person of whose sin the Lord will take no account nor reckon it against him. -- romans 4:8
.
Is this blessing (happiness) then meant only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness. -- romans 4:9
.
How then was it credited [to him]? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. -- romans 4:10
.
He received the mark of circumcision as a token or an evidence [and] seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised--[faith] so that he was to be made the father of all who [truly] believe, though without circumcision, and who thus have righteousness (right standing with God) imputed to them and credited to their account, -- romans 4:11
.
As well as [that he be made] the father of those circumcised persons who are not merely circumcised, but also walk in the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. -- romans 4:12
.
For the promise to Abraham or his posterity, that he should inherit the world, did not come through [observing the commands of] the Law but through the righteousness of faith. -- romans 4:13
.
If it is the adherents of the Law who are to be the heirs, then faith is made futile and empty of all meaning and the promise [of God] is made void (is annulled and has no power). -- romans 4:14
.
For the Law results in [divine] wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression [of it either]. -- romans 4:15
.
Therefore, [inheriting] the promise is the outcome of faith and depends [entirely] on faith, in order that it might be given as an act of grace (unmerited favor), to make it stable and valid and guaranteed to all his descendants--not only to the devotees and adherents of the Law, but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, who is [thus] the father of us all. -- romans 4:16
.
As it is written, I have made you the father of many nations. [He was appointed our father] in the sight of God in Whom he believed, Who gives life to the dead and speaks of the nonexistent things that [He has foretold and promised] as if they [already] existed. -- romans 4:17
.
[For Abraham, human reason for] hope being gone, hoped in faith that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been promised, So [numberless] shall your descendants be. -- romans 4:18
.
He did not weaken in faith when he considered the [utter] impotence of his own body, which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old, or [when he considered] the barrenness of Sarah's [deadened] womb. -- romans 4:19
.
No unbelief or distrust made him waver (doubtingly question) concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong and was empowered by faith as he gave praise and glory to God, -- romans 4:20
.
Fully satisfied and assured that God was able and mighty to keep His word and to do what He had promised. -- romans 4:21
.
That is why his faith was credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God). -- romans 4:22
.
But [the words], It was credited to him, were written not for his sake alone, -- romans 4:23
.
But [they were written] for our sakes too. [Righteousness, standing acceptable to God] will be granted and credited to us also who believe in (trust in, adhere to, and rely on) God, Who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, -- romans 4:24
.
Who was betrayed and put to death because of our misdeeds and was raised to secure our justification (our acquittal), [making our account balance and absolving us from all guilt before God]. -- romans 4:25
.
THEREFORE, SINCE we are justified (acquitted, declared righteous, and given a right standing with God) through faith, let us [grasp the fact that we] have [the peace of reconciliation to hold and to enjoy] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- romans 5:1
.
Through Him also we have [our] access (entrance, introduction) by faith into this grace (state of God's favor) in which we [firmly and safely] stand. And let us rejoice and exult in our hope of experiencing and enjoying the glory of God. -- romans 5:2
.
Moreover [let us also be full of joy now!] let us exult and triumph in our troubles and rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that pressure and affliction and hardship produce patient and unswerving endurance. -- romans 5:3
.
And endurance (fortitude) develops maturity of character (approved faith and tried integrity). And character [of this sort] produces [the habit of] joyful and confident hope of eternal salvation. -- romans 5:4
.
Such hope never disappoints or deludes or shames us, for God's love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who has been given to us. -- romans 5:5
.
While we were yet in weakness [powerless to help ourselves], at the fitting time Christ died for (in behalf of) the ungodly. -- romans 5:6
.
Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to give his life even for an upright man, though perhaps for a noble and lovable and generous benefactor someone might even dare to die. -- romans 5:7
.
But God shows and clearly proves His [own] love for us by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) died for us. -- romans 5:8
.
Therefore, since we are now justified (acquitted, made righteous, and brought into right relationship with God) by Christ's blood, how much more [certain is it that] we shall be saved by Him from the indignation and wrath of God. -- romans 5:9
.
For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, it is much more [certain], now that we are reconciled, that we shall be saved (daily delivered from sin's dominion) through His [resurrection] life. -- romans 5:10
.
Not only so, but we also rejoice and exultingly glory in God [in His love and perfection] through our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom we have now received and enjoy [our] reconciliation. -- romans 5:11
.
Therefore, as sin came into the world through one man, and death as the result of sin, so death spread to all men, [no one being able to stop it or to escape its power] because all men sinned. -- romans 5:12
.
[To be sure] sin was in the world before ever the Law was given, but sin is not charged to men's account where there is no law [to transgress]. -- romans 5:13
.
Yet death held sway from Adam to Moses [the Lawgiver], even over those who did not themselves transgress [a positive command] as Adam did. Adam was a type (prefigure) of the One Who was to come [in reverse, the former destructive, the Latter saving]. -- romans 5:14
.
But God's free gift is not at all to be compared to the trespass [His grace is out of all proportion to the fall of man]. For if many died through one man's falling away (his lapse, his offense), much more profusely did God's grace and the free gift [that comes] through the undeserved favor of the one Man Jesus Christ abound and overflow to and for [the benefit of] many. -- romans 5:15
.
Nor is the free gift at all to be compared to the effect of that one [man's] sin. For the sentence [following the trespass] of one [man] brought condemnation, whereas the free gift [following] many transgressions brings justification (an act of righteousness). -- romans 5:16
.
For if because of one man's trespass (lapse, offense) death reigned through that one, much more surely will those who receive [God's] overflowing grace (unmerited favor) and the free gift of righteousness [putting them into right standing with Himself] reign as kings in life through the one Man Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- romans 5:17
.
Well then, as one man's trespass [one man's false step and falling away led] to condemnation for all men, so one Man's act of righteousness [leads] to acquittal and right standing with God and life for all men. -- romans 5:18
.
For just as by one man's disobedience (failing to hear, heedlessness, and carelessness) the many were constituted sinners, so by one Man's obedience the many will be constituted righteous (made acceptable to God, brought into right standing with Him). -- romans 5:19
.
But then Law came in, [only] to expand and increase the trespass [making it more apparent and exciting opposition]. But where sin increased and abounded, grace (God's unmerited favor) has surpassed it and increased the more and superabounded, -- romans 5:20
.
So that, [just] as sin has reigned in death, [so] grace (His unearned and undeserved favor) might reign also through righteousness (right standing with God) which issues in eternal life through Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) our Lord. -- romans 5:21
.
WHAT SHALL we say [to all this]? Are we to remain in sin in order that God's grace (favor and mercy) may multiply and overflow? -- romans 6:1
.
Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer? -- romans 6:2
.
Are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? -- romans 6:3
.
We were buried therefore with Him by the baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious [power] of the Father, so we too might [habitually] live and behave in newness of life. -- romans 6:4
.
For if we have become one with Him by sharing a death like His, we shall also be [one with Him in sharing] His resurrection [by a new life lived for God]. -- romans 6:5
.
We know that our old (unrenewed) self was nailed to the cross with Him in order that [our] body [which is the instrument] of sin might be made ineffective and inactive for evil, that we might no longer be the slaves of sin. -- romans 6:6
.
For when a man dies, he is freed (loosed, delivered) from [the power of] sin [among men]. -- romans 6:7
.
Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, -- romans 6:8
.
Because we know that Christ (the Anointed One), being once raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has power over Him. -- romans 6:9
.
For by the death He died, He died to sin [ending His relation to it] once for all; and the life that He lives, He is living to God [in unbroken fellowship with Him]. -- romans 6:10
.
Even so consider yourselves also dead to sin and your relation to it broken, but alive to God [living in unbroken fellowship with Him] in Christ Jesus. -- romans 6:11
.
Let not sin therefore rule as king in your mortal (short-lived, perishable) bodies, to make you yield to its cravings and be subject to its lusts and evil passions. -- romans 6:12
.
Do not continue offering or yielding your bodily members [and faculties] to sin as instruments (tools) of wickedness. But offer and yield yourselves to God as though you have been raised from the dead to [perpetual] life, and your bodily members [and faculties] to God, presenting them as implements of righteousness. -- romans 6:13
.
For sin shall not [any longer] exert dominion over you, since now you are not under Law [as slaves], but under grace [as subjects of God's favor and mercy]. -- romans 6:14
.
What then [are we to conclude]? Shall we sin because we live not under Law but under God's favor and mercy? Certainly not! -- romans 6:15
.
Do you not know that if you continually surrender yourselves to anyone to do his will, you are the slaves of him whom you obey, whether that be to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience which leads to righteousness (right doing and right standing with God)? -- romans 6:16
.
But thank God, though you were once slaves of sin, you have become obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed and to which you were committed. -- romans 6:17
.
And having been set free from sin, you have become the servants of righteousness (of conformity to the divine will in thought, purpose, and action). -- romans 6:18
.
I am speaking in familiar human terms because of your natural limitations. For as you yielded your bodily members [and faculties] as servants to impurity and ever increasing lawlessness, so now yield your bodily members [and faculties] once for all as servants to righteousness (right being and doing) [which leads] to sanctification. -- romans 6:19
.
For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. -- romans 6:20
.
But then what benefit (return) did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? [None] for the end of those things is death. -- romans 6:21
.
But now since you have been set free from sin and have become the slaves of God, you have your present reward in holiness and its end is eternal life. -- romans 6:22
.
For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord. -- romans 6:23
.
DO YOU not know, brethren--for I am speaking to men who are acquainted with the Law--that legal claims have power over a person only for as long as he is alive? -- romans 7:1
.
For [instance] a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies, she is loosed and discharged from the law concerning her husband. -- romans 7:2
.
Accordingly, she will be held an adulteress if she unites herself to another man while her husband lives. But if her husband dies, the marriage law no longer is binding on her [she is free from that law]; and if she unites herself to another man, she is not an adulteress. -- romans 7:3
.
Likewise, my brethren, you have undergone death as to the Law through the [crucified] body of Christ, so that now you may belong to Another, to Him Who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God. -- romans 7:4
.
When we were living in the flesh (mere physical lives), the sinful passions that were awakened and aroused up by [what] the Law [makes sin] were constantly operating in our natural powers (in our bodily organs, in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh), so that we bore fruit for death. -- romans 7:5
.
But now we are discharged from the Law and have terminated all intercourse with it, having died to what once restrained and held us captive. So now we serve not under [obedience to] the old code of written regulations, but [under obedience to the promptings] of the Spirit in newness [of life]. -- romans 7:6
.
What then do we conclude? Is the Law identical with sin? Certainly not! Nevertheless, if it had not been for the Law, I should not have recognized sin or have known its meaning. [For instance] I would not have known about covetousness [would have had no consciousness of sin or sense of guilt] if the Law had not [repeatedly] said, You shall not covet and have an evil desire [for one thing and another]. -- romans 7:7
.
But sin, finding opportunity in the commandment [to express itself], got a hold on me and aroused and stimulated all kinds of forbidden desires (lust, covetousness). For without the Law sin is dead [the sense of it is inactive and a lifeless thing]. -- romans 7:8
.
Once I was alive, but quite apart from and unconscious of the Law. But when the commandment came, sin lived again and I died (was sentenced by the Law to death). -- romans 7:9
.
And the very legal ordinance which was designed and intended to bring life actually proved [to mean to me] death. -- romans 7:10
.
For sin, seizing the opportunity and getting a hold on me [by taking its incentive] from the commandment, beguiled and entrapped and cheated me, and using it [as a weapon], killed me. -- romans 7:11
.
The Law therefore is holy, and [each] commandment is holy and just and good. -- romans 7:12
.
Did that which is good then prove fatal [bringing death] to me? Certainly not! It was sin, working death in me by using this good thing [as a weapon], in order that through the commandment sin might be shown up clearly to be sin, that the extreme malignity and immeasurable sinfulness of sin might plainly appear. -- romans 7:13
.
We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am a creature of the flesh [carnal, unspiritual], having been sold into slavery under [the control of] sin. -- romans 7:14
.
For I do not understand my own actions [I am baffled, bewildered]. I do not practice or accomplish what I wish, but I do the very thing that I loathe [which my moral instinct condemns]. -- romans 7:15
.
Now if I do [habitually] what is contrary to my desire, [that means that] I acknowledge and agree that the Law is good (morally excellent) and that I take sides with it. -- romans 7:16
.
However, it is no longer I who do the deed, but the sin [principle] which is at home in me and has possession of me. -- romans 7:17
.
For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot perform it. [I have the intention and urge to do what is right, but no power to carry it out.] -- romans 7:18
.
For I fail to practice the good deeds I desire to do, but the evil deeds that I do not desire to do are what I am [ever] doing. -- romans 7:19
.
Now if I do what I do not desire to do, it is no longer I doing it [it is not myself that acts], but the sin [principle] which dwells within me [fixed and operating in my soul]. -- romans 7:20
.
So I find it to be a law (rule of action of my being) that when I want to do what is right and good, evil is ever present with me and I am subject to its insistent demands. -- romans 7:21
.
For I endorse and delight in the Law of God in my inmost self [with my new nature]. -- romans 7:22
.
But I discern in my bodily members [in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh] a different law (rule of action) at war against the law of my mind (my reason) and making me a prisoner to the law of sin that dwells in my bodily organs [in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh]. -- romans 7:23
.
O unhappy and pitiable and wretched man that I am! Who will release and deliver me from [the shackles of] this body of death? -- romans 7:24
.
O thank God! [He will!] through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) our Lord! So then indeed I, of myself with the mind and heart, serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin. -- romans 7:25
.
THEREFORE, [there is] now no condemnation (no adjudging guilty of wrong) for those who are in Christ Jesus, who live [and] walk not after the dictates of the flesh, but after the dictates of the Spirit. -- romans 8:1
.
For the law of the Spirit of life [which is] in Christ Jesus [the law of our new being] has freed me from the law of sin and of death. -- romans 8:2
.
For God has done what the Law could not do, [its power] being weakened by the flesh [the entire nature of man without the Holy Spirit]. Sending His own Son in the guise of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, [God] condemned sin in the flesh [subdued, overcame, deprived it of its power over all who accept that sacrifice], -- romans 8:3
.
So that the righteous and just requirement of the Law might be fully met in us who live and move not in the ways of the flesh but in the ways of the Spirit [our lives governed not by the standards and according to the dictates of the flesh, but controlled by the Holy Spirit]. -- romans 8:4
.
For those who are according to the flesh and are controlled by its unholy desires set their minds on and pursue those things which gratify the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit and are controlled by the desires of the Spirit set their minds on and seek those things which gratify the [Holy] Spirit. -- romans 8:5
.
Now the mind of the flesh [which is sense and reason without the Holy Spirit] is death [death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin, both here and hereafter]. But the mind of the [Holy] Spirit is life and [soul] peace [both now and forever]. -- romans 8:6
.
[That is] because the mind of the flesh [with its carnal thoughts and purposes] is hostile to God, for it does not submit itself to God's Law; indeed it cannot. -- romans 8:7
.
So then those who are living the life of the flesh [catering to the appetites and impulses of their carnal nature] cannot please or satisfy God, or be acceptable to Him. -- romans 8:8
.
But you are not living the life of the flesh, you are living the life of the Spirit, if the [Holy] Spirit of God [really] dwells within you [directs and controls you]. But if anyone does not possess the [Holy] Spirit of Christ, he is none of His [he does not belong to Christ, is not truly a child of God]. -- romans 8:9
.
But if Christ lives in you, [then although] your [natural] body is dead by reason of sin and guilt, the spirit is alive because of [the] righteousness [that He imputes to you]. -- romans 8:10
.
And if the Spirit of Him Who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, [then] He Who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also restore to life your mortal (short-lived, perishable) bodies through His Spirit Who dwells in you. -- romans 8:11
.
So then, brethren, we are debtors, but not to the flesh [we are not obligated to our carnal nature], to live [a life ruled by the standards set up by the dictates] of the flesh. -- romans 8:12
.
For if you live according to [the dictates of] the flesh, you will surely die. But if through the power of the [Holy] Spirit you are [habitually] putting to death (making extinct, deadening) the [evil] deeds prompted by the body, you shall [really and genuinely] live forever. -- romans 8:13
.
For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. -- romans 8:14
.
For [the Spirit which] you have now received [is] not a spirit of slavery to put you once more in bondage to fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption [the Spirit producing sonship] in [the bliss of] which we cry, Abba (Father)! Father! -- romans 8:15
.
The Spirit Himself [thus] testifies together with our own spirit, [assuring us] that we are children of God. -- romans 8:16
.
And if we are [His] children, then we are [His] heirs also: heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [sharing His inheritance with Him]; only we must share His suffering if we are to share His glory. -- romans 8:17
.
[But what of that?] For I consider that the sufferings of this present time (this present life) are not worth being compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us and in us and for us and conferred on us! -- romans 8:18
.
For [even the whole] creation (all nature) waits expectantly and longs earnestly for God's sons to be made known [waits for the revealing, the disclosing of their sonship]. -- romans 8:19
.
For the creation (nature) was subjected to frailty (to futility, condemned to frustration), not because of some intentional fault on its part, but by the will of Him Who so subjected it--[yet] with the hope -- romans 8:20
.
That nature (creation) itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and corruption [and gain an entrance] into the glorious freedom of God's children. -- romans 8:21
.
We know that the whole creation [of irrational creatures] has been moaning together in the pains of labor until now. -- romans 8:22
.
And not only the creation, but we ourselves too, who have and enjoy the firstfruits of the [Holy] Spirit [a foretaste of the blissful things to come] groan inwardly as we wait for the redemption of our bodies [from sensuality and the grave, which will reveal] our adoption (our manifestation as God's sons). -- romans 8:23
.
For in [this] hope we were saved. But hope [the object of] which is seen is not hope. For how can one hope for what he already sees? -- romans 8:24
.
But if we hope for what is still unseen by us, we wait for it with patience and composure. -- romans 8:25
.
So too the [Holy] Spirit comes to our aid and bears us up in our weakness; for we do not know what prayer to offer nor how to offer it worthily as we ought, but the Spirit Himself goes to meet our supplication and pleads in our behalf with unspeakable yearnings and groanings too deep for utterance. -- romans 8:26
.
And He Who searches the hearts of men knows what is in the mind of the [Holy] Spirit [what His intent is], because the Spirit intercedes and pleads [before God] in behalf of the saints according to and in harmony with God's will. -- romans 8:27
.
We are assured and know that [God being a partner in their labor] all things work together and are [fitting into a plan] for good to and for those who love God and are called according to [His] design and purpose. -- romans 8:28
.
For those whom He foreknew [of whom He was aware and loved beforehand], He also destined from the beginning [foreordaining them] to be molded into the image of His Son [and share inwardly His likeness], that He might become the firstborn among many brethren. -- romans 8:29
.
And those whom He thus foreordained, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified (acquitted, made righteous, putting them into right standing with Himself). And those whom He justified, He also glorified [raising them to a heavenly dignity and condition or state of being]. -- romans 8:30
.
What then shall we say to [all] this? If God is for us, who [can be] against us? [Who can be our foe, if God is on our side?] -- romans 8:31
.
He who did not withhold or spare [even] His own Son but gave Him up for us all, will He not also with Him freely and graciously give us all [other] things? -- romans 8:32
.
Who shall bring any charge against God's elect [when it is] God Who justifies [that is, Who puts us in right relation to Himself? Who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom God has chosen? Will God, Who acquits us?] -- romans 8:33
.
Who is there to condemn [us]? Will Christ Jesus (the Messiah), Who died, or rather Who was raised from the dead, Who is at the right hand of God actually pleading as He intercedes for us? -- romans 8:34
.
Who shall ever separate us from Christ's love? Shall suffering and affliction and tribulation? Or calamity and distress? Or persecution or hunger or destitution or peril or sword? -- romans 8:35
.
Even as it is written, For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we are regarded and counted as sheep for the slaughter. -- romans 8:36
.
Yet amid all these things we are more than conquerors and gain a surpassing victory through Him Who loved us. -- romans 8:37
.
For I am persuaded beyond doubt (am sure) that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things impending and threatening nor things to come, nor powers, -- romans 8:38
.
Nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- romans 8:39
.
I AM speaking the truth in Christ. I am not lying; my conscience [enlightened and prompted] by the Holy Spirit bearing witness with me -- romans 9:1
.
That I have bitter grief and incessant anguish in my heart. -- romans 9:2
.
For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off and banished from Christ for the sake of my brethren and instead of them, my natural kinsmen and my fellow countrymen. -- romans 9:3
.
For they are Israelites, and to them belong God's adoption [as a nation] and the glorious Presence (Shekinah). With them were the special covenants made, to them was the Law given. To them [the temple] worship was revealed and [God's own] promises announced. -- romans 9:4
.
To them belong the patriarchs, and as far as His natural descent was concerned, from them is the Christ, Who is exalted and supreme over all, God, blessed forever! Amen (so let it be). -- romans 9:5
.
However, it is not as though God's Word had failed [coming to nothing]. For it is not everybody who is a descendant of Jacob (Israel) who belongs to [the true] Israel. -- romans 9:6
.
And they are not all the children of Abraham because they are by blood his descendants. No, [the promise was] Your descendants will be called and counted through the line of Isaac [though Abraham had an older son]. -- romans 9:7
.
That is to say, it is not the children of the body [of Abraham] who are made God's children, but it is the offspring to whom the promise applies that shall be counted [as Abraham's true] descendants. -- romans 9:8
.
For this is what the promise said, About this time [next year] will I return and Sarah shall have a son. -- romans 9:9
.
And not only that, but this too: Rebecca conceived [two sons under exactly the same circumstances] by our forefather Isaac, -- romans 9:10
.
And the children were yet unborn and had so far done nothing either good or evil. Even so, in order further to carry out God's purpose of selection (election, choice), which depends not on works or what men can do, but on Him Who calls [them], -- romans 9:11
.
It was said to her that the elder [son] should serve the younger [son]. -- romans 9:12
.
As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated (held in relative disregard in comparison with My feeling for Jacob). -- romans 9:13
.
What shall we conclude then? Is there injustice upon God's part? Certainly not! -- romans 9:14
.
For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion (pity) on whom I will have compassion. -- romans 9:15
.
So then [God's gift] is not a question of human will and human effort, but of God's mercy. [It depends not on one's own willingness nor on his strenuous exertion as in running a race, but on God's having mercy on him.] -- romans 9:16
.
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, I have raised you up for this very purpose of displaying My power in [dealing with] you, so that My name may be proclaimed the whole world over. -- romans 9:17
.
So then He has mercy on whomever He wills (chooses) and He hardens (makes stubborn and unyielding the heart of) whomever He wills. -- romans 9:18
.
You will say to me, Why then does He still find fault and blame us [for sinning]? For who can resist and withstand His will? -- romans 9:19
.
But who are you, a mere man, to criticize and contradict and answer back to God? Will what is formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus? -- romans 9:20
.
Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same mass (lump) one vessel for beauty and distinction and honorable use, and another for menial or ignoble and dishonorable use? -- romans 9:21
.
What if God, although fully intending to show [the awfulness of] His wrath and to make known His power and authority, has tolerated with much patience the vessels (objects) of [His] anger which are ripe for destruction? -- romans 9:22
.
And [what if] He thus purposes to make known and show the wealth of His glory in [dealing with] the vessels (objects) of His mercy which He has prepared beforehand for glory, -- romans 9:23
.
Even including ourselves whom He has called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles (heathen)? -- romans 9:24
.
Just as He says in Hosea, Those who were not My people I will call My people, and her who was not beloved [I will call] My beloved. -- romans 9:25
.
And it shall be that in the very place where it was said to them, You are not My people, they shall be called sons of the living God. -- romans 9:26
.
And Isaiah calls out (solemnly cries aloud) over Israel: Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, only the remnant (a small part of them) will be saved [from perdition, condemnation, judgment]! -- romans 9:27
.
For the Lord will execute His sentence upon the earth [He will conclude and close His account with men completely and without delay], rigorously cutting it short in His justice. -- romans 9:28
.
It is as Isaiah predicted, If the Lord of hosts had not left us a seed [from which to propagate descendants], we [Israel] would have fared like Sodom and have been made like Gomorrah. -- romans 9:29
.
What shall we say then? That Gentiles who did not follow after righteousness [who did not seek salvation by right relationship to God] have attained it by faith [a righteousness imputed by God, based on and produced by faith], -- romans 9:30
.
Whereas Israel, though ever in pursuit of a law [for the securing] of righteousness (right standing with God), actually did not succeed in fulfilling the Law. -- romans 9:31
.
For what reason? Because [they pursued it] not through faith, relying [instead] on the merit of their works [they did not depend on faith but on what they could do]. They have stumbled over the Stumbling Stone. -- romans 9:32
.
As it is written, Behold I am laying in Zion a Stone that will make men stumble, a Rock that will make them fall; but he who believes in Him [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him] shall not be put to shame nor be disappointed in his expectations. -- romans 9:33
.
BRETHREN, [with all] my heart's desire and goodwill for [Israel], I long and pray to God that they may be saved. -- romans 10:1
.
I bear them witness that they have a [certain] zeal and enthusiasm for God, but it is not enlightened and according to [correct and vital] knowledge. -- romans 10:2
.
For being ignorant of the righteousness that God ascribes [which makes one acceptable to Him in word, thought, and deed] and seeking to establish a righteousness (a means of salvation) of their own, they did not obey or submit themselves to God's righteousness. -- romans 10:3
.
For Christ is the end of the Law [the limit at which it ceases to be, for the Law leads up to Him Who is the fulfillment of its types, and in Him the purpose which it was designed to accomplish is fulfilled. That is, the purpose of the Law is fulfilled in Him] as the means of righteousness (right relationship to God) for everyone who trusts in and adheres to and relies on Him. -- romans 10:4
.
For Moses writes that the man who [can] practice the righteousness (perfect conformity to God's will) which is based on the Law [with all its intricate demands] shall live by it. -- romans 10:5
.
But the righteousness based on faith [imputed by God and bringing right relationship with Him] says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into Heaven? that is, to bring Christ down; -- romans 10:6
.
Or who will descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ up from the dead [as if we could be saved by our own efforts]. -- romans 10:7
.
But what does it say? The Word (God's message in Christ) is near you, on your lips and in your heart; that is, the Word (the message, the basis and object) of faith which we preach, -- romans 10:8
.
Because if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe (adhere to, trust in, and rely on the truth) that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. -- romans 10:9
.
For with the heart a person believes (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Christ) and so is justified (declared righteous, acceptable to God), and with the mouth he confesses (declares openly and speaks out freely his faith) and confirms [his] salvation. -- romans 10:10
.
The Scripture says, No man who believes in Him [who adheres to, relies on, and trusts in Him] will [ever] be put to shame or be disappointed. -- romans 10:11
.
[No one] for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. The same Lord is Lord over all [of us] and He generously bestows His riches upon all who call upon Him [in faith]. -- romans 10:12
.
For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord [invoking Him as Lord] will be saved. -- romans 10:13
.
But how are people to call upon Him Whom they have not believed [in Whom they have no faith, on Whom they have no reliance]? And how are they to believe in Him [adhere to, trust in, and rely upon Him] of Whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher? -- romans 10:14
.
And how can men [be expected to] preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings! [How welcome is the coming of those who preach the good news of His good things!] -- romans 10:15
.
But they have not all heeded the Gospel; for Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed (had faith in) what he has heard from us? -- romans 10:16
.
So faith comes by hearing [what is told], and what is heard comes by the preaching [of the message that came from the lips] of Christ (the Messiah Himself). -- romans 10:17
.
But I ask, Have they not heard? Indeed they have; [for the Scripture says] Their voice [that of nature bearing God's message] has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the far bounds of the world. -- romans 10:18
.
Again I ask, Did Israel not understand? [Did the Jews have no warning that the Gospel was to go forth to the Gentiles, to all the earth?] First, there is Moses who says, I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry. -- romans 10:19
.
Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, I have been found by those who did not seek Me; I have shown (revealed) Myself to those who did not [consciously] ask for Me. -- romans 10:20
.
But of Israel he says, All day long I have stretched out My hands to a people unyielding and disobedient and self-willed [to a faultfinding, contrary, and contradicting people]. -- romans 10:21
.
I ASK then: Has God totally rejected and disowned His people? Of course not! Why, I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin! [I Sam. 12:22; Jer. 31:37; 33:24-26; Phil. 3:5.] -- romans 11:1
.
No, God has not rejected and disowned His people [whose destiny] He had marked out and appointed and foreknown from the beginning. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? -- romans 11:2
.
Lord, they have killed Your prophets; they have demolished Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life. -- romans 11:3
.
But what is God's reply to him? I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal! [I Kings 19:18.] -- romans 11:4
.
So too at the present time there is a remnant (a small believing minority), selected (chosen) by grace (by God's unmerited favor and graciousness). -- romans 11:5
.
But if it is by grace (His unmerited favor and graciousness), it is no longer conditioned on works or anything men have done. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace [it would be meaningless]. -- romans 11:6
.
What then [shall we conclude]? Israel failed to obtain what it sought [God's favor by obedience to the Law]. Only the elect (those chosen few) obtained it, while the rest of them became callously indifferent (blinded, hardened, and made insensible to it). -- romans 11:7
.
As it is written, God gave them a spirit (an attitude) of stupor, eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear, [that has continued] down to this very day. -- romans 11:8
.
And David says, Let their table (their feasting, banqueting) become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a just retribution [rebounding like a boomerang upon them]; -- romans 11:9
.
Let their eyes be darkened (dimmed) so that they cannot see, and make them bend their back [stooping beneath their burden] forever. -- romans 11:10
.
So I ask, Have they stumbled so as to fall [to their utter spiritual ruin, irretrievably]? By no means! But through their false step and transgression salvation [has come] to the Gentiles, so as to arouse Israel [to see and feel what they forfeited] and so to make them jealous. -- romans 11:11
.
Now if their stumbling (their lapse, their transgression) has so enriched the world [at large], and if [Israel's] failure means such riches for the Gentiles, think what an enrichment and greater advantage will follow their full reinstatement! -- romans 11:12
.
But now I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I lay great stress on my ministry and magnify my office, -- romans 11:13
.
In the hope of making my fellow Jews jealous [in order to stir them up to imitate, copy, and appropriate], and thus managing to save some of them. -- romans 11:14
.
For if their rejection and exclusion from the benefits of salvation were [overruled] for the reconciliation of a world to God, what will their acceptance and admission mean? [It will be nothing short of] life from the dead! -- romans 11:15
.
Now if the first handful of dough offered as the firstfruits [Abraham and the patriarchs] is consecrated (holy), so is the whole mass [the nation of Israel]; and if the root [Abraham] is consecrated (holy), so are the branches. -- romans 11:16
.
But if some of the branches were broken off, while you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them to share the richness [of the root and sap] of the olive tree, -- romans 11:17
.
Do not boast over the branches and pride yourself at their expense. If you do boast and feel superior, remember it is not you that support the root, but the root [that supports] you. -- romans 11:18
.
You will say then, Branches were broken (pruned) off so that I might be grafted in! -- romans 11:19
.
That is true. But they were broken (pruned) off because of their unbelief (their lack of real faith), and you are established through faith [because you do believe]. So do not become proud and conceited, but rather stand in awe and be reverently afraid. -- romans 11:20
.
For if God did not spare the natural branches [because of unbelief], neither will He spare you [if you are guilty of the same offense]. -- romans 11:21
.
Then note and appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's gracious kindness to you--provided you continue in His grace and abide in His kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off (pruned away). -- romans 11:22
.
And even those others [the fallen branches, Jews], if they do not persist in [clinging to] their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. -- romans 11:23
.
For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and against nature grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much easier will it be to graft these natural [branches] back on [the original parent stock of] their own olive tree. -- romans 11:24
.
Lest you be self-opinionated (wise in your own conceits), I do not want you to miss this hidden truth and mystery, brethren: a hardening (insensibility) has [temporarily] befallen a part of Israel [to last] until the full number of the ingathering of the Gentiles has come in, -- romans 11:25
.
And so all Israel will be saved. As it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, He will banish ungodliness from Jacob. -- romans 11:26
.
And this will be My covenant (My agreement) with them when I shall take away their sins. -- romans 11:27
.
From the point of view of the Gospel (good news), they [the Jews, at present] are enemies [of God], which is for your advantage and benefit. But from the point of view of God's choice (of election, of divine selection), they are still the beloved (dear to Him) for the sake of their forefathers. -- romans 11:28
.
For God's gifts and His call are irrevocable. [He never withdraws them when once they are given, and He does not change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call.] -- romans 11:29
.
Just as you were once disobedient and rebellious toward God but now have obtained [His] mercy, through their disobedience, -- romans 11:30
.
So they also now are being disobedient [when you are receiving mercy], that they in turn may one day, through the mercy you are enjoying, also receive mercy [that they may share the mercy which has been shown to you--through you as messengers of the Gospel to them]. -- romans 11:31
.
For God has consigned (penned up) all men to disobedience, only that He may have mercy on them all [alike]. -- romans 11:32
.
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unfathomable (inscrutable, unsearchable) are His judgments (His decisions)! And how untraceable (mysterious, undiscoverable) are His ways (His methods, His paths)! -- romans 11:33
.
For who has known the mind of the Lord and who has understood His thoughts, or who has [ever] been His counselor? -- romans 11:34
.
Or who has first given God anything that he might be paid back or that he could claim a recompense? -- romans 11:35
.
For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. [For all things originate with Him and come from Him; all things live through Him, and all things center in and tend to consummate and to end in Him.] To Him be glory forever! Amen (so be it). -- romans 11:36
.
I APPEAL to you therefore, brethren, and beg of you in view of [all] the mercies of God, to make a decisive dedication of your bodies [presenting all your members and faculties] as a living sacrifice, holy (devoted, consecrated) and well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable (rational, intelligent) service and spiritual worship. -- romans 12:1
.
Do not be conformed to this world (this age), [fashioned after and adapted to its external, superficial customs], but be transformed (changed) by the [entire] renewal of your mind [by its new ideals and its new attitude], so that you may prove [for yourselves] what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God, even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His sight for you]. -- romans 12:2
.
For by the grace (unmerited favor of God) given to me I warn everyone among you not to estimate and think of himself more highly than he ought [not to have an exaggerated opinion of his own importance], but to rate his ability with sober judgment, each according to the degree of faith apportioned by God to him. -- romans 12:3
.
For as in one physical body we have many parts (organs, members) and all of these parts do not have the same function or use, -- romans 12:4
.
So we, numerous as we are, are one body in Christ (the Messiah) and individually we are parts one of another [mutually dependent on one another]. -- romans 12:5
.
Having gifts (faculties, talents, qualities) that differ according to the grace given us, let us use them: [He whose gift is] prophecy, [let him prophesy] according to the proportion of his faith; -- romans 12:6
.
[He whose gift is] practical service, let him give himself to serving; he who teaches, to his teaching; -- romans 12:7
.
He who exhorts (encourages), to his exhortation; he who contributes, let him do it in simplicity and liberality; he who gives aid and superintends, with zeal and singleness of mind; he who does acts of mercy, with genuine cheerfulness and joyful eagerness. -- romans 12:8
.
[Let your] love be sincere (a real thing); hate what is evil [loathe all ungodliness, turn in horror from wickedness], but hold fast to that which is good. -- romans 12:9
.
Love one another with brotherly affection [as members of one family], giving precedence and showing honor to one another. -- romans 12:10
.
Never lag in zeal and in earnest endeavor; be aglow and burning with the Spirit, serving the Lord. -- romans 12:11
.
Rejoice and exult in hope; be steadfast and patient in suffering and tribulation; be constant in prayer. -- romans 12:12
.
Contribute to the needs of God's people [sharing in the necessities of the saints]; pursue the practice of hospitality. -- romans 12:13
.
Bless those who persecute you [who are cruel in their attitude toward you]; bless and do not curse them. -- romans 12:14
.
Rejoice with those who rejoice [sharing others' joy], and weep with those who weep [sharing others' grief]. -- romans 12:15
.
Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty (snobbish, high-minded, exclusive), but readily adjust yourself to [people, things] and give yourselves to humble tasks. Never overestimate yourself or be wise in your own conceits. -- romans 12:16
.
Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is honest and proper and noble [aiming to be above reproach] in the sight of everyone. -- romans 12:17
.
If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. -- romans 12:18
.
Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave the way open for [God's] wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay (requite), says the Lord. -- romans 12:19
.
But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head. -- romans 12:20
.
Do not let yourself be overcome by evil, but overcome (master) evil with good. -- romans 12:21
.
LET EVERY person be loyally subject to the governing (civil) authorities. For there is no authority except from God [by His permission, His sanction], and those that exist do so by God's appointment. -- romans 13:1
.
Therefore he who resists and sets himself up against the authorities resists what God has appointed and arranged [in divine order]. And those who resist will bring down judgment upon themselves [receiving the penalty due them]. -- romans 13:2
.
For civil authorities are not a terror to [people of] good conduct, but to [those of] bad behavior. Would you have no dread of him who is in authority? Then do what is right and you will receive his approval and commendation. -- romans 13:3
.
For he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, [you should dread him and] be afraid, for he does not bear and wear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant to execute His wrath (punishment, vengeance) on the wrongdoer. -- romans 13:4
.
Therefore one must be subject, not only to avoid God's wrath and escape punishment, but also as a matter of principle and for the sake of conscience. -- romans 13:5
.
For this same reason you pay taxes, for [the civil authorities] are official servants under God, devoting themselves to attending to this very service. -- romans 13:6
.
Render to all men their dues. [Pay] taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, and honor to whom honor is due. -- romans 13:7
.
Keep out of debt and owe no man anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor [who practices loving others] has fulfilled the Law [relating to one's fellowmen, meeting all its requirements]. -- romans 13:8
.
The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet (have an evil desire), and any other commandment, are summed up in the single command, You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself. -- romans 13:9
.
Love does no wrong to one's neighbor [it never hurts anybody]. Therefore love meets all the requirements and is the fulfilling of the Law. -- romans 13:10
.
Besides this you know what [a critical] hour this is, how it is high time now for you to wake up out of your sleep (rouse to reality). For salvation (final deliverance) is nearer to us now than when we first believed (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Christ, the Messiah). -- romans 13:11
.
The night is far gone and the day is almost here. Let us then drop (fling away) the works and deeds of darkness and put on the [full] armor of light. -- romans 13:12
.
Let us live and conduct ourselves honorably and becomingly as in the [open light of] day, not in reveling (carousing) and drunkenness, not in immorality and debauchery (sensuality and licentiousness), not in quarreling and jealousy. -- romans 13:13
.
But clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah), and make no provision for [indulging] the flesh [put a stop to thinking about the evil cravings of your physical nature] to [gratify its] desires (lusts). -- romans 13:14
.
AS FOR the man who is a weak believer, welcome him [into your fellowship], but not to criticize his opinions or pass judgment on his scruples or perplex him with discussions. -- romans 14:1
.
One [man's faith permits him to] believe he may eat anything, while a weaker one [limits his] eating to vegetables. -- romans 14:2
.
Let not him who eats look down on or despise him who abstains, and let not him who abstains criticize and pass judgment on him who eats; for God has accepted and welcomed him. -- romans 14:3
.
Who are you to pass judgment on and censure another's household servant? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he shall stand and be upheld, for the Master (the Lord) is mighty to support him and make him stand. -- romans 14:4
.
One man esteems one day as better than another, while another man esteems all days alike [sacred]. Let everyone be fully convinced (satisfied) in his own mind. -- romans 14:5
.
He who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. He also who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; while he who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. -- romans 14:6
.
None of us lives to himself [but to the Lord], and none of us dies to himself [but to the Lord, for] -- romans 14:7
.
If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or we die, we belong to the Lord. -- romans 14:8
.
For Christ died and lived again for this very purpose, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living. -- romans 14:9
.
Why do you criticize and pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you look down upon or despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God. -- romans 14:10
.
For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God [acknowledge Him to His honor and to His praise]. -- romans 14:11
.
And so each of us shall give an account of himself [give an answer in reference to judgment] to God. -- romans 14:12
.
Then let us no more criticize and blame and pass judgment on one another, but rather decide and endeavor never to put a stumbling block or an obstacle or a hindrance in the way of a brother. -- romans 14:13
.
I know and am convinced (persuaded) as one in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is [forbidden as] essentially unclean (defiled and unholy in itself). But [none the less] it is unclean (defiled and unholy) to anyone who thinks it is unclean. -- romans 14:14
.
But if your brother is being pained or his feelings hurt or if he is being injured by what you eat, [then] you are no longer walking in love. [You have ceased to be living and conducting yourself by the standard of love toward him.] Do not let what you eat hurt or cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died! -- romans 14:15
.
Do not therefore let what seems good to you be considered an evil thing [by someone else]. [In other words, do not give occasion for others to criticize that which is justifiable for you.] -- romans 14:16
.
[After all] the kingdom of God is not a matter of [getting the] food and drink [one likes], but instead it is righteousness (that state which makes a person acceptable to God) and [heart] peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. -- romans 14:17
.
He who serves Christ in this way is acceptable and pleasing to God and is approved by men. -- romans 14:18
.
So let us then definitely aim for and eagerly pursue what makes for harmony and for mutual upbuilding (edification and development) of one another. -- romans 14:19
.
You must not, for the sake of food, undo and break down and destroy the work of God! Everything is indeed [ceremonially] clean and pure, but it is wrong for anyone to hurt the conscience of others or to make them fall by what he eats. -- romans 14:20
.
The right thing is to eat no meat or drink no wine [at all], or [do anything else] if it makes your brother stumble or hurts his conscience or offends or weakens him. -- romans 14:21
.
Your personal convictions [on such matters]--exercise [them] as in God's presence, keeping them to yourself [striving only to know the truth and obey His will]. Blessed (happy, to be envied) is he who has no reason to judge himself for what he approves [who does not convict himself by what he chooses to do]. -- romans 14:22
.
But the man who has doubts (misgivings, an uneasy conscience) about eating, and then eats [perhaps because of you], stands condemned [before God], because he is not true to his convictions and he does not act from faith. For whatever does not originate and proceed from faith is sin [whatever is done without a conviction of its approval by God is sinful]. -- romans 14:23
.
WE WHO are strong [in our convictions and of robust faith] ought to bear with the failings and the frailties and the tender scruples of the weak; [we ought to help carry the doubts and qualms of others] and not to please ourselves. -- romans 15:1
.
Let each one of us make it a practice to please (make happy) his neighbor for his good and for his true welfare, to edify him [to strengthen him and build him up spiritually]. -- romans 15:2
.
For Christ did not please Himself [gave no thought to His own interests]; but, as it is written, The reproaches and abuses of those who reproached and abused you fell on Me. -- romans 15:3
.
For whatever was thus written in former days was written for our instruction, that by [our steadfast and patient] endurance and the encouragement [drawn] from the Scriptures we might hold fast to and cherish hope. -- romans 15:4
.
Now may the God Who gives the power of patient endurance (steadfastness) and Who supplies encouragement, grant you to live in such mutual harmony and such full sympathy with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, -- romans 15:5
.
That together you may [unanimously] with united hearts and one voice, praise and glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- romans 15:6
.
Welcome and receive [to your hearts] one another, then, even as Christ has welcomed and received you, for the glory of God. -- romans 15:7
.
For I tell you that Christ (the Messiah) became a servant and a minister to the circumcised (the Jews) in order to show God's truthfulness and honesty by confirming (verifying) the promises [given] to our fathers, -- romans 15:8
.
And [also in order] that the Gentiles (nations) might glorify God for His mercy [not covenanted] to them. As it is written, Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles and sing praises to Your name. -- romans 15:9
.
Again it is said, Rejoice (exult), O Gentiles, along with His [own] people; -- romans 15:10
.
And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise Him! -- romans 15:11
.
And further Isaiah says, There shall be a Sprout from the Root of Jesse, He Who rises to rule over the Gentiles; in Him shall the Gentiles hope. -- romans 15:12
.
May the God of your hope so fill you with all joy and peace in believing [through the experience of your faith] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound and be overflowing (bubbling over) with hope. -- romans 15:13
.
Personally I am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are rich in goodness, amply filled with all [spiritual] knowledge and competent to admonish and counsel and instruct one another also. -- romans 15:14
.
Still on some points I have written to you the more boldly and unreservedly by way of reminder. [I have done so] because of the grace (the unmerited favor) bestowed on me by God -- romans 15:15
.
In making me a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I act in the priestly service of the Gospel (the good news) of God, in order that the sacrificial offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable [to God], consecrated and made holy by the Holy Spirit. -- romans 15:16
.
In Christ Jesus, then, I have legitimate reason to glory (exult) in my work for God [in what through Christ Jesus I have accomplished concerning the things of God]. -- romans 15:17
.
For [of course] I will not venture (presume) to speak thus of any work except what Christ has actually done through me [as an instrument in His hands] to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed, -- romans 15:18
.
[Even as my preaching has been accompanied] with the power of signs and wonders, [and all of it] by the power of the Holy Spirit. [The result is] that starting from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum, I have fully preached the Gospel [faithfully executing, accomplishing, carrying out to the full the good news] of Christ (the Messiah) in its entirety. -- romans 15:19
.
Thus my ambition has been to preach the Gospel, not where Christ's name has already been known, lest I build on another man's foundation; -- romans 15:20
.
But [instead I would act on the principle] as it is written, They shall see who have never been told of Him, and they shall understand who have never heard [of Him]. -- romans 15:21
.
This [ambition] is the reason why I have so frequently been hindered from coming to visit you. -- romans 15:22
.
But now since I have no further opportunity for work in these regions, and since I have longed for enough years to come to you, -- romans 15:23
.
I hope to see you in passing [through Rome] as I go [on my intended trip] to Spain, and to be aided on my journey there by you, after I have enjoyed your company for a little while. -- romans 15:24
.
For the present, however, I am going to Jerusalem to bring aid (relief) for the saints (God's people there). -- romans 15:25
.
For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make some contribution for the poor among the saints of Jerusalem. -- romans 15:26
.
They were pleased to do it; and surely they are in debt to them, for if these Gentiles have come to share in their [the Jerusalem Jews'] spiritual blessings, then they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings. -- romans 15:27
.
When therefore I have completed this mission and have delivered to them [at Jerusalem] what has been raised, I shall go on by way of you to Spain. -- romans 15:28
.
And I know that when I do come to you, I shall come in the abundant blessing of the Gospel of Christ. -- romans 15:29
.
I appeal to you [I entreat you], brethren, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love [given by] the Spirit, to unite with me in earnest wrestling in prayer to God in my behalf. -- romans 15:30
.
[Pray] that I may be delivered (rescued) from the unbelievers in Judea and that my mission of relief to Jerusalem may be acceptable and graciously received by the saints (God's people there), -- romans 15:31
.
So that by God's will I may subsequently come to you with joy (with a happy heart) and be refreshed [by the interval of rest] in your company. -- romans 15:32
.
May [our] peace-giving God be with you all! Amen (so be it). -- romans 15:33
.
NOW I introduce and commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deaconess of the church at Cenchreae, -- romans 16:1
.
That you may receive her in the Lord [with a Christian welcome], as saints (God's people) ought to receive one another. And help her in whatever matter she may require assistance from you, for she has been a helper of many including myself [shielding us from suffering]. -- romans 16:2
.
Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, -- romans 16:3
.
Who risked their lives [endangering their very necks] for my life. To them not only I but also all the churches among the Gentiles give thanks. -- romans 16:4
.
[Remember me] also to the church [that meets] in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was a firstfruit (first convert) to Christ in Asia. -- romans 16:5
.
Greet Mary, who has worked so hard among you. -- romans 16:6
.
Remember me to Andronicus and Junias, my tribal kinsmen and once my fellow prisoners. They are men held in high esteem among the apostles, who also were in Christ before I was. -- romans 16:7
.
Remember me to Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. -- romans 16:8
.
Salute Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear Stachys. -- romans 16:9
.
Greet Apelles, that one tried and approved in Christ (the Messiah). Remember me to those who belong to the household of Aristobulus. -- romans 16:10
.
Greet my tribal kinsman Herodion, and those in the Lord who belong to the household of Narcissus. -- romans 16:11
.
Salute those workers in the Lord, Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Greet my dear Persis, who has worked so hard in the Lord. -- romans 16:12
.
Remember me to Rufus, eminent in the Lord, also to his mother [who has been] a mother to me as well. -- romans 16:13
.
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren who are with them. -- romans 16:14
.
Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. -- romans 16:15
.
Greet one another with a holy (consecrated) kiss. All the churches of Christ (the Messiah) wish to be remembered to you. -- romans 16:16
.
I appeal to you, brethren, to be on your guard concerning those who create dissensions and difficulties and cause divisions, in opposition to the doctrine (the teaching) which you have been taught. [I warn you to turn aside from them, to] avoid them. -- romans 16:17
.
For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites and base desires, and by ingratiating and flattering speech, they beguile the hearts of the unsuspecting and simpleminded [people]. -- romans 16:18
.
For while your loyalty and obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, I would have you well versed and wise as to what is good and innocent and guileless as to what is evil. -- romans 16:19
.
And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you. -- romans 16:20
.
Timothy, my fellow worker, wishes to be remembered to you, as do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my tribal kinsmen. -- romans 16:21
.
I, Tertius, the writer of this letter, greet you in the Lord. -- romans 16:22
.
Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church here, greets you. So do Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus. -- romans 16:23
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it). -- romans 16:24
.
Now to Him Who is able to strengthen you in the faith which is in accordance with my Gospel and the preaching of (concerning) Jesus Christ (the Messiah), according to the revelation (the unveiling) of the mystery of the plan of redemption which was kept in silence and secret for long ages, -- romans 16:25
.
But is now disclosed and through the prophetic Scriptures is made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, [to win them] to obedience to the faith, -- romans 16:26
.
To [the] only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One)! Amen (so be it). -- romans 16:27
.
PAUL, SUMMONED by the will and purpose of God to be an apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes, -- 1 corinthians 1:1
.
To the church (assembly) of God which is in Corinth, to those consecrated and purified and made holy in Christ Jesus, [who are] selected and called to be saints (God's people), together with all those who in any place call upon and give honor to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours: -- 1 corinthians 1:2
.
Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) be to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 1:3
.
I thank my God at all times for you because of the grace (the favor and spiritual blessing) of God which was bestowed on you in Christ Jesus, -- 1 corinthians 1:4
.
[So] that in Him in every respect you were enriched, in full power and readiness of speech [to speak of your faith] and complete knowledge and illumination [to give you full insight into its meaning]. -- 1 corinthians 1:5
.
In this way [our] witnessing concerning Christ (the Messiah) was so confirmed and established and made sure in you -- 1 corinthians 1:6
.
That you are not [consciously] falling behind or lacking in any special spiritual endowment or Christian grace [the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating in your souls by the Holy Spirit], while you wait and watch [constantly living in hope] for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and [His] being made visible to all. -- 1 corinthians 1:7
.
And He will establish you to the end [keep you steadfast, give you strength, and guarantee your vindication; He will be your warrant against all accusation or indictment so that you will be] guiltless and irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- 1 corinthians 1:8
.
God is faithful (reliable, trustworthy, and therefore ever true to His promise, and He can be depended on); by Him you were called into companionship and participation with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. -- 1 corinthians 1:9
.
But I urge and entreat you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in perfect harmony and full agreement in what you say, and that there be no dissensions or factions or divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding and in your opinions and judgments. -- 1 corinthians 1:10
.
For it has been made clear to me, my brethren, by those of Chloe's household, that there are contentions and wrangling and factions among you. -- 1 corinthians 1:11
.
What I mean is this, that each one of you [either] says, I belong to Paul, or I belong to Apollos, or I belong to Cephas (Peter), or I belong to Christ. -- 1 corinthians 1:12
.
Is Christ (the Messiah) divided into parts? Was Paul crucified on behalf of you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? -- 1 corinthians 1:13
.
I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, -- 1 corinthians 1:14
.
Lest anyone should say that I baptized in my own name. -- 1 corinthians 1:15
.
[Yes] I did baptize the household of Stephanas also. More than these, I do not remember that I baptized anyone. -- 1 corinthians 1:16
.
For Christ (the Messiah) sent me out not to baptize but [to evangelize by] preaching the glad tidings (the Gospel), and that not with verbal eloquence, lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of force and emptied of its power and rendered vain (fruitless, void of value, and of no effect). -- 1 corinthians 1:17
.
For the story and message of the cross is sheer absurdity and folly to those who are perishing and on their way to perdition, but to us who are being saved it is the [manifestation of] the power of God. -- 1 corinthians 1:18
.
For it is written, I will baffle and render useless and destroy the learning of the learned and the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever and the discernment of the discerning; I will frustrate and nullify [them] and bring [them] to nothing. -- 1 corinthians 1:19
.
Where is the wise man (the philosopher)? Where is the scribe (the scholar)? Where is the investigator (the logician, the debater) of this present time and age? Has not God shown up the nonsense and the folly of this world's wisdom? -- 1 corinthians 1:20
.
For when the world with all its earthly wisdom failed to perceive and recognize and know God by means of its own philosophy, God in His wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching [salvation, procured by Christ and to be had through Him], to save those who believed (who clung to and trusted in and relied on Him). -- 1 corinthians 1:21
.
For while Jews [demandingly] ask for signs and miracles and Greeks pursue philosophy and wisdom, -- 1 corinthians 1:22
.
We preach Christ (the Messiah) crucified, [preaching which] to the Jews is a scandal and an offensive stumbling block [that springs a snare or trap], and to the Gentiles it is absurd and utterly unphilosophical nonsense. -- 1 corinthians 1:23
.
But to those who are called, whether Jew or Greek (Gentile), Christ [is] the Power of God and the Wisdom of God. -- 1 corinthians 1:24
.
[This is] because the foolish thing [that has its source in] God is wiser than men, and the weak thing [that springs] from God is stronger than men. -- 1 corinthians 1:25
.
For [simply] consider your own call, brethren; not many [of you were considered to be] wise according to human estimates and standards, not many influential and powerful, not many of high and noble birth. -- 1 corinthians 1:26
.
[No] for God selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame, and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame. -- 1 corinthians 1:27
.
And God also selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is lowborn and insignificant and branded and treated with contempt, even the things that are nothing, that He might depose and bring to nothing the things that are, -- 1 corinthians 1:28
.
So that no mortal man should [have pretense for glorying and] boast in the presence of God. -- 1 corinthians 1:29
.
But it is from Him that you have your life in Christ Jesus, Whom God made our Wisdom from God, [revealed to us a knowledge of the divine plan of salvation previously hidden, manifesting itself as] our Righteousness [thus making us upright and putting us in right standing with God], and our Consecration [making us pure and holy], and our Redemption [providing our ransom from eternal penalty for sin]. -- 1 corinthians 1:30
.
So then, as it is written, Let him who boasts and proudly rejoices and glories, boast and proudly rejoice and glory in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 1:31
.
AS FOR myself, brethren, when I came to you, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony and evidence or mystery and secret of God [concerning what He has done through Christ for the salvation of men] in lofty words of eloquence or human philosophy and wisdom; -- 1 corinthians 2:1
.
For I resolved to know nothing (to be acquainted with nothing, to make a display of the knowledge of nothing, and to be conscious of nothing) among you except Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and Him crucified. -- 1 corinthians 2:2
.
And I was in (passed into a state of) weakness and fear (dread) and great trembling [after I had come] among you. -- 1 corinthians 2:3
.
And my language and my message were not set forth in persuasive (enticing and plausible) words of wisdom, but they were in demonstration of the [Holy] Spirit and power [a proof by the Spirit and power of God, operating on me and stirring in the minds of my hearers the most holy emotions and thus persuading them], -- 1 corinthians 2:4
.
So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men (human philosophy), but in the power of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:5
.
Yet when we are among the full-grown (spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding), we do impart a [higher] wisdom (the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden); but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age or of this world nor of the leaders and rulers of this age, who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away. -- 1 corinthians 2:6
.
But rather what we are setting forth is a wisdom of God once hidden [from the human understanding] and now revealed to us by God--[that wisdom] which God devised and decreed before the ages for our glorification [to lift us into the glory of His presence]. -- 1 corinthians 2:7
.
None of the rulers of this age or world perceived and recognized and understood this, for if they had, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory. -- 1 corinthians 2:8
.
But, on the contrary, as the Scripture says, What eye has not seen and ear has not heard and has not entered into the heart of man, [all that] God has prepared (made and keeps ready) for those who love Him [who hold Him in affectionate reverence, promptly obeying Him and gratefully recognizing the benefits He has bestowed]. -- 1 corinthians 2:9
.
Yet to us God has unveiled and revealed them by and through His Spirit, for the [Holy] Spirit searches diligently, exploring and examining everything, even sounding the profound and bottomless things of God [the divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man's scrutiny]. -- 1 corinthians 2:10
.
For what person perceives (knows and understands) what passes through a man's thoughts except the man's own spirit within him? Just so no one discerns (comes to know and comprehend) the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:11
.
Now we have not received the spirit [that belongs to] the world, but the [Holy] Spirit Who is from God, [given to us] that we might realize and comprehend and appreciate the gifts [of divine favor and blessing so freely and lavishly] bestowed on us by God. -- 1 corinthians 2:12
.
And we are setting these truths forth in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the [Holy] Spirit, combining and interpreting spiritual truths with spiritual language [to those who possess the Holy Spirit]. -- 1 corinthians 2:13
.
But the natural, nonspiritual man does not accept or welcome or admit into his heart the gifts and teachings and revelations of the Spirit of God, for they are folly (meaningless nonsense) to him; and he is incapable of knowing them [of progressively recognizing, understanding, and becoming better acquainted with them] because they are spiritually discerned and estimated and appreciated. -- 1 corinthians 2:14
.
But the spiritual man tries all things [he examines, investigates, inquires into, questions, and discerns all things], yet is himself to be put on trial and judged by no one [he can read the meaning of everything, but no one can properly discern or appraise or get an insight into him]. -- 1 corinthians 2:15
.
For who has known or understood the mind (the counsels and purposes) of the Lord so as to guide and instruct Him and give Him knowledge? But we have the mind of Christ (the Messiah) and do hold the thoughts (feelings and purposes) of His heart. -- 1 corinthians 2:16
.
HOWEVER, BRETHREN, I could not talk to you as to spiritual [men], but as to nonspiritual [men of the flesh, in whom the carnal nature predominates], as to mere infants [in the new life] in Christ [unable to talk yet!] -- 1 corinthians 3:1
.
I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not yet strong enough [to be ready for it]; but even yet you are not strong enough [to be ready for it], -- 1 corinthians 3:2
.
For you are still [unspiritual, having the nature] of the flesh [under the control of ordinary impulses]. For as long as [there are] envying and jealousy and wrangling and factions among you, are you not unspiritual and of the flesh, behaving yourselves after a human standard and like mere (unchanged) men? -- 1 corinthians 3:3
.
For when one says, I belong to Paul, and another, I belong to Apollos, are you not [proving yourselves] ordinary (unchanged) men? -- 1 corinthians 3:4
.
What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Ministering servants [not heads of parties] through whom you believed, even as the Lord appointed to each his task: -- 1 corinthians 3:5
.
I planted, Apollos watered, but God [all the while] was making it grow and [He] gave the increase. -- 1 corinthians 3:6
.
So neither he who plants is anything nor he who waters, but [only] God Who makes it grow and become greater. -- 1 corinthians 3:7
.
He who plants and he who waters are equal (one in aim, of the same importance and esteem), yet each shall receive his own reward (wages), according to his own labor. -- 1 corinthians 3:8
.
For we are fellow workmen (joint promoters, laborers together) with and for God; you are God's garden and vineyard and field under cultivation, [you are] God's building. -- 1 corinthians 3:9
.
According to the grace (the special endowment for my task) of God bestowed on me, like a skillful architect and master builder I laid [the] foundation, and now another [man] is building upon it. But let each [man] be careful how he builds upon it, -- 1 corinthians 3:10
.
For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is [already] laid, which is Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- 1 corinthians 3:11
.
But if anyone builds upon the Foundation, whether it be with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, -- 1 corinthians 3:12
.
The work of each [one] will become [plainly, openly] known (shown for what it is); for the day [of Christ] will disclose and declare it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test and critically appraise the character and worth of the work each person has done. -- 1 corinthians 3:13
.
If the work which any person has built on this Foundation [any product of his efforts whatever] survives [this test], he will get his reward. -- 1 corinthians 3:14
.
But if any person's work is burned up [under the test], he will suffer the loss [of it all, losing his reward], though he himself will be saved, but only as [one who has passed] through fire. -- 1 corinthians 3:15
.
Do you not discern and understand that you [the whole church at Corinth] are God's temple (His sanctuary), and that God's Spirit has His permanent dwelling in you [to be at home in you, collectively as a church and also individually]? -- 1 corinthians 3:16
.
If anyone does hurt to God's temple or corrupts it [with false doctrines] or destroys it, God will do hurt to him and bring him to the corruption of death and destroy him. For the temple of God is holy (sacred to Him) and that [temple] you [the believing church and its individual believers] are. -- 1 corinthians 3:17
.
Let no person deceive himself. If anyone among you supposes that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool [let him discard his worldly discernment and recognize himself as dull, stupid, and foolish, without true learning and scholarship], that he may become [really] wise. -- 1 corinthians 3:18
.
For this world's wisdom is foolishness (absurdity and stupidity) with God, for it is written, He lays hold of the wise in their [own] craftiness; -- 1 corinthians 3:19
.
And again, The Lord knows the thoughts and reasonings of the [humanly] wise and recognizes how futile they are. -- 1 corinthians 3:20
.
So let no one exult proudly concerning men [boasting of having this or that man as a leader], for all things are yours, -- 1 corinthians 3:21
.
Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter), or the universe or life or death, or the immediate and threatening present or the [subsequent and uncertain] future--all are yours, -- 1 corinthians 3:22
.
And you are Christ's, and Christ is God's. -- 1 corinthians 3:23
.
SO THEN, let us [apostles] be looked upon as ministering servants of Christ and stewards (trustees) of the mysteries (the secret purposes) of God. -- 1 corinthians 4:1
.
Moreover, it is [essentially] required of stewards that a man should be found faithful [proving himself worthy of trust]. -- 1 corinthians 4:2
.
But [as for me personally] it matters very little to me that I should be put on trial by you [on this point], and that you or any other human tribunal should investigate and question and cross-question me. I do not even put myself on trial and judge myself. -- 1 corinthians 4:3
.
I am not conscious of anything against myself, and I feel blameless; but I am not vindicated and acquitted before God on that account. It is the Lord [Himself] Who examines and judges me. -- 1 corinthians 4:4
.
So do not make any hasty or premature judgments before the time when the Lord comes [again], for He will both bring to light the secret things that are [now hidden] in darkness and disclose and expose the [secret] aims (motives and purposes) of hearts. Then every man will receive his [due] commendation from God. -- 1 corinthians 4:5
.
Now I have applied all this [about parties and factions] to myself and Apollos for your sakes, brethren, so that from what I have said of us [as illustrations], you may learn [to think of men in accordance with Scripture and] not to go beyond that which is written, that none of you may be puffed up and inflated with pride and boast in favor of one [minister and teacher] against another. -- 1 corinthians 4:6
.
For who separates you from the others [as a faction leader]? [Who makes you superior and sets you apart from another, giving you the preeminence?] What have you that was not given to you? If then you received it [from someone], why do you boast as if you had not received [but had gained it by your own efforts]? -- 1 corinthians 4:7
.
[You behave as if] you are already filled and think you have enough [you are full and content, feeling no need of anything more]! Already you have become rich [in spiritual gifts and graces]! [Without any counsel or instruction from us, in your conceit], you have ascended your thrones and come into your kingdom without including us! And would that it were true and that you did reign, so that we might be sharing the kingdom with you! -- 1 corinthians 4:8
.
For it seems to me that God has made an exhibit of us apostles, exposing us to view last [of all, like men in a triumphal procession who are] sentenced to death [and displayed at the end of the line]. For we have become a spectacle to the world [a show in the world's amphitheater] with both men and angels [as spectators]. -- 1 corinthians 4:9
.
We are [looked upon as] fools on account of Christ and for His sake, but you are [supposedly] so amazingly wise and prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are [so very] strong! You are highly esteemed, but we are in disrepute and contempt! -- 1 corinthians 4:10
.
To this hour we have gone both hungry and thirsty; we [habitually] wear but one undergarment [and shiver in the cold]; we are roughly knocked about and wander around homeless. -- 1 corinthians 4:11
.
And we still toil unto weariness [for our living], working hard with our own hands. When men revile us [wound us with an accursed sting], we bless them. When we are persecuted, we take it patiently and endure it. -- 1 corinthians 4:12
.
When we are slandered and defamed, we [try to] answer softly and bring comfort. We have been made and are now the rubbish and filth of the world [the offscouring of all things, the scum of the earth]. -- 1 corinthians 4:13
.
I do not write this to shame you, but to warn and counsel you as my beloved children. -- 1 corinthians 4:14
.
After all, though you should have ten thousand teachers (guides to direct you) in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the glad tidings (the Gospel). -- 1 corinthians 4:15
.
So I urge and implore you, be imitators of me. -- 1 corinthians 4:16
.
For this very cause I sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord, who will recall to your minds my methods of proceeding and course of conduct and way of life in Christ, such as I teach everywhere in each of the churches. -- 1 corinthians 4:17
.
Some of you have become conceited and arrogant and pretentious, counting on my not coming to you. -- 1 corinthians 4:18
.
But I will come to you [and] shortly, if the Lord is willing, and then I will perceive and understand not what the talk of these puffed up and arrogant spirits amount to, but their force (the moral power and excellence of soul they really possess). -- 1 corinthians 4:19
.
For the kingdom of God consists of and is based on not talk but power (moral power and excellence of soul). -- 1 corinthians 4:20
.
Now which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of correction, or with love and in a spirit of gentleness? -- 1 corinthians 4:21
.
IT IS actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, impurity of a sort that is condemned and does not occur even among the heathen; for a man has [his own] father's wife. -- 1 corinthians 5:1
.
And you are proud and arrogant! And you ought rather to mourn (bow in sorrow and in shame) until the person who has done this [shameful] thing is removed from your fellowship and your midst! -- 1 corinthians 5:2
.
As for my attitude, though I am absent [from you] in body, I am present in spirit, and I have already decided and passed judgment, as if actually present, -- 1 corinthians 5:3
.
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, on the man who has committed such a deed. When you and my own spirit are met together with the power of our Lord Jesus, -- 1 corinthians 5:4
.
You are to deliver this man over to Satan for physical discipline [to destroy carnal lusts which prompted him to incest], that [his] spirit may [yet] be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. -- 1 corinthians 5:5
.
[About the condition of your church] your boasting is not good [indeed, it is most unseemly and entirely out of place]. Do you not know that [just] a little leaven will ferment the whole lump [of dough]? -- 1 corinthians 5:6
.
Purge (clean out) the old leaven that you may be fresh (new) dough, still uncontaminated [as you are], for Christ, our Passover [Lamb], has been sacrificed. -- 1 corinthians 5:7
.
Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of vice and malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened [bread] of purity (nobility, honor) and sincerity and [unadulterated] truth. -- 1 corinthians 5:8
.
I wrote you in my [previous] letter not to associate [closely and habitually] with unchaste (impure) people-- -- 1 corinthians 5:9
.
Not [meaning of course that you must] altogether shun the immoral people of this world, or the greedy graspers and cheats and thieves or idolaters, since otherwise you would need to get out of the world and human society altogether! -- 1 corinthians 5:10
.
But now I write to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of [Christian] brother if he is known to be guilty of immorality or greed, or is an idolater [whose soul is devoted to any object that usurps the place of God], or is a person with a foul tongue [railing, abusing, reviling, slandering], or is a drunkard or a swindler or a robber. [No] you must not so much as eat with such a person. -- 1 corinthians 5:11
.
What [business] of mine is it and what right have I to judge outsiders? Is it not those inside [the church] upon whom you are to pass disciplinary judgment [passing censuring sentence on them as the facts require]? -- 1 corinthians 5:12
.
God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside. Drive out that wicked one from among you [expel him from your church]. -- 1 corinthians 5:13
.
DOES ANY of you dare, when he has a matter of complaint against another [brother], to go to law before unrighteous men [men neither upright nor right with God, laying it before them] instead of before the saints (the people of God)? -- 1 corinthians 6:1
.
Do you not know that the saints (the believers) will [one day] judge and govern the world? And if the world [itself] is to be judged and ruled by you, are you unworthy and incompetent to try [such petty matters] of the smallest courts of justice? -- 1 corinthians 6:2
.
Do you not know also that we [Christians] are to judge the [very] angels and pronounce opinion between right and wrong [for them]? How much more then [as to] matters pertaining to this world and of this life only! -- 1 corinthians 6:3
.
If then you do have such cases of everyday life to decide, why do you appoint [as judges to lay them before] those who [from the standpoint] of the church count for least and are without standing? -- 1 corinthians 6:4
.
I say this to move you to shame. Can it be that there really is not one man among you who [in action is governed by piety and integrity and] is wise and competent enough to decide [the private grievances, disputes, and quarrels] between members of the brotherhood, -- 1 corinthians 6:5
.
But brother goes to law against brother, and that before [Gentile judges who are] unbelievers [without faith or trust in the Gospel of Christ]? -- 1 corinthians 6:6
.
Why, the very fact of your having lawsuits with one another at all is a defect (a defeat, an evidence of positive moral loss for you). Why not rather let yourselves suffer wrong and be deprived of what is your due? Why not rather be cheated (defrauded and robbed)? -- 1 corinthians 6:7
.
But [instead it is you] yourselves who wrong and defraud, and that even your own brethren [by so treating them]! -- 1 corinthians 6:8
.
Do you not know that the unrighteous and the wrongdoers will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived (misled): neither the impure and immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who participate in homosexuality, -- 1 corinthians 6:9
.
Nor cheats (swindlers and thieves), nor greedy graspers, nor drunkards, nor foulmouthed revilers and slanderers, nor extortioners and robbers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God. -- 1 corinthians 6:10
.
And such some of you were [once]. But you were washed clean (purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin), and you were consecrated (set apart, hallowed), and you were justified [pronounced righteous, by trusting] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God. -- 1 corinthians 6:11
.
Everything is permissible (allowable and lawful) for me; but not all things are helpful (good for me to do, expedient and profitable when considered with other things). Everything is lawful for me, but I will not become the slave of anything or be brought under its power. -- 1 corinthians 6:12
.
Food [is intended] for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will finally end [the functions of] both and bring them to nothing. The body is not intended for sexual immorality, but [is intended] for the Lord, and the Lord [is intended] for the body [to save, sanctify, and raise it again]. -- 1 corinthians 6:13
.
And God both raised the Lord to life and will also raise us up by His power. -- 1 corinthians 6:14
.
Do you not see and know that your bodies are members (bodily parts) of Christ (the Messiah)? Am I therefore to take the parts of Christ and make [them] parts of a prostitute? Never! Never! -- 1 corinthians 6:15
.
Or do you not know and realize that when a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? The two, it is written, shall become one flesh. -- 1 corinthians 6:16
.
But the person who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him. -- 1 corinthians 6:17
.
Shun immorality and all sexual looseness [flee from impurity in thought, word, or deed]. Any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. -- 1 corinthians 6:18
.
Do you not know that your body is the temple (the very sanctuary) of the Holy Spirit Who lives within you, Whom you have received [as a Gift] from God? You are not your own, -- 1 corinthians 6:19
.
You were bought with a price [purchased with a preciousness and paid for, made His own]. So then, honor God and bring glory to Him in your body. -- 1 corinthians 6:20
.
NOW AS to the matters of which you wrote me. It is well [and by that I mean advantageous, expedient, profitable, and wholesome] for a man not to touch a woman [to cohabit with her] but to remain unmarried. -- 1 corinthians 7:1
.
But because of the temptation to impurity and to avoid immorality, let each [man] have his own wife and let each [woman] have her own husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:2
.
The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights (goodwill, kindness, and what is due her as his wife), and likewise the wife to her husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:3
.
For the wife does not have [exclusive] authority and control over her own body, but the husband [has his rights]; likewise also the husband does not have [exclusive] authority and control over his body, but the wife [has her rights]. -- 1 corinthians 7:4
.
Do not refuse and deprive and defraud each other [of your due marital rights], except perhaps by mutual consent for a time, so that you may devote yourselves unhindered to prayer. But afterwards resume marital relations, lest Satan tempt you [to sin] through your lack of restraint of sexual desire. -- 1 corinthians 7:5
.
But I am saying this more as a matter of permission and concession, not as a command or regulation. -- 1 corinthians 7:6
.
I wish that all men were like I myself am [in this matter of self-control]. But each has his own special gift from God, one of this kind and one of another. -- 1 corinthians 7:7
.
But to the unmarried people and to the widows, I declare that it is well (good, advantageous, expedient, and wholesome) for them to remain [single] even as I do. -- 1 corinthians 7:8
.
But if they have not self-control (restraint of their passions), they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame [with passion and tortured continually with ungratified desire]. -- 1 corinthians 7:9
.
But to the married people I give charge--not I but the Lord--that the wife is not to separate from her husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:10
.
But if she does [separate from and divorce him], let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband. And [I charge] the husband [also] that he should not put away or divorce his wife. -- 1 corinthians 7:11
.
To the rest I declare--I, not the Lord [for Jesus did not discuss this]--that if any brother has a wife who does not believe [in Christ] and she consents to live with him, he should not leave or divorce her. -- 1 corinthians 7:12
.
And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she should not leave or divorce him. -- 1 corinthians 7:13
.
For the unbelieving husband is set apart (separated, withdrawn from heathen contamination, and affiliated with the Christian people) by union with his consecrated (set-apart) wife, and the unbelieving wife is set apart and separated through union with her consecrated husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean (unblessed heathen, outside the Christian covenant), but as it is they are prepared for God [pure and clean]. -- 1 corinthians 7:14
.
But if the unbelieving partner [actually] leaves, let him do so; in such [cases the remaining] brother or sister is not morally bound. But God has called us to peace. -- 1 corinthians 7:15
.
For, wife, how can you be sure of converting and saving your husband? Husband, how can you be sure of converting and saving your wife? -- 1 corinthians 7:16
.
Only, let each one [seek to conduct himself and regulate his affairs so as to] lead the life which the Lord has allotted and imparted to him and to which God has invited and summoned him. This is my order in all the churches. -- 1 corinthians 7:17
.
Was anyone at the time of his summons [from God] already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the evidence of circumcision. Was anyone at the time [God] called him uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised. -- 1 corinthians 7:18
.
For circumcision is nothing and counts for nothing, neither does uncircumcision, but [what counts is] keeping the commandments of God. -- 1 corinthians 7:19
.
Everyone should remain after God calls him in the station or condition of life in which the summons found him. -- 1 corinthians 7:20
.
Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. But if you are able to gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity. -- 1 corinthians 7:21
.
For he who as a slave was summoned in [to union with] the Lord is a freedman of the Lord, just so he who was free when he was called is a bond servant of Christ (the Messiah). -- 1 corinthians 7:22
.
You were bought with a price [purchased with a preciousness and paid for by Christ]; then do not yield yourselves up to become [in your own estimation] slaves to men [but consider yourselves slaves to Christ]. -- 1 corinthians 7:23
.
So, brethren, in whatever station or state or condition of life each one was when he was called, there let him continue with and close to God. -- 1 corinthians 7:24
.
Now concerning the virgins (the marriageable maidens) I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion and advice as one who by the Lord's mercy is rendered trustworthy and faithful. -- 1 corinthians 7:25
.
I think then, because of the impending distress [that is even now setting in], it is well (expedient, profitable, and wholesome) for a person to remain as he or she is. -- 1 corinthians 7:26
.
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. -- 1 corinthians 7:27
.
But if you do marry, you do not sin [in doing so], and if a virgin marries, she does not sin [in doing so]. Yet those who marry will have physical and earthly troubles, and I would like to spare you that. -- 1 corinthians 7:28
.
I mean, brethren, the appointed time has been winding down and it has grown very short. From now on, let even those who have wives be as if they had none, -- 1 corinthians 7:29
.
And those who weep and mourn as though they were not weeping and mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not possess anything, -- 1 corinthians 7:30
.
And those who deal with this world [overusing the enjoyments of this life] as though they were not absorbed by it and as if they had no dealings with it. For the outward form of this world (the present world order) is passing away. -- 1 corinthians 7:31
.
My desire is to have you free from all anxiety and distressing care. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord--how he may please the Lord; -- 1 corinthians 7:32
.
But the married man is anxious about worldly matters--how he may please his wife-- -- 1 corinthians 7:33
.
And he is drawn in diverging directions [his interests are divided and he is distracted from his devotion to God]. And the unmarried woman or girl is concerned and anxious about the matters of the Lord, how to be wholly separated and set apart in body and spirit; but the married woman has her cares [centered] in earthly affairs--how she may please her husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:34
.
Now I say this for your own welfare and profit, not to put [a halter of] restraint upon you, but to promote what is seemly and in good order and to secure your undistracted and undivided devotion to the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 7:35
.
But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward and in regard to his virgin [that he is preparing disgrace for her or incurring reproach], in case she is passing the bloom of her youth and if there is need for it, let him do what to him seems right; he does not sin; let them marry. -- 1 corinthians 7:36
.
But whoever is firmly established in his heart [strong in mind and purpose], not being forced by necessity but having control over his own will and desire, and has resolved this in his heart to keep his own virginity, he is doing well. -- 1 corinthians 7:37
.
So also then, he [the father] who gives his virgin (his daughter) in marriage does well, and he [the father] who does not give [her] in marriage does better. -- 1 corinthians 7:38
.
A wife is bound to her husband by law as long as he lives. If the husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she will, only [provided that he too is] in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 7:39
.
But in my opinion [a widow] is happier (more blessed and to be envied) if she does not remarry. And also I think I have the Spirit of God. -- 1 corinthians 7:40
.
NOW ABOUT food offered to idols: of course we know that all of us possess knowledge [concerning these matters. Yet mere] knowledge causes people to be puffed up (to bear themselves loftily and be proud), but love (affection and goodwill and benevolence) edifies and builds up and encourages one to grow [to his full stature]. -- 1 corinthians 8:1
.
If anyone imagines that he has come to know and understand much [of divine things, without love], he does not yet perceive and recognize and understand as strongly and clearly, nor has he become as intimately acquainted with anything as he ought or as is necessary. -- 1 corinthians 8:2
.
But if one loves God truly [with affectionate reverence, prompt obedience, and grateful recognition of His blessing], he is known by God [recognized as worthy of His intimacy and love, and he is owned by Him]. -- 1 corinthians 8:3
.
In this matter, then, of eating food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing (has no real existence) and that there is no God but one. -- 1 corinthians 8:4
.
For although there may be so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many of them, both of gods and of lords and masters, -- 1 corinthians 8:5
.
Yet for us there is [only] one God, the Father, Who is the Source of all things and for Whom we [have life], and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through and by Whom are all things and through and by Whom we [ourselves exist]. -- 1 corinthians 8:6
.
Nevertheless, not all [believers] possess this knowledge. But some, through being all their lives until now accustomed to [thinking of] idols [as real and living], still consider the food [offered to an idol] as that sacrificed to an [actual] god; and their weak consciences become defiled and injured if they eat [it]. -- 1 corinthians 8:7
.
Now food [itself] will not cause our acceptance by God nor commend us to Him. Eating [food offered to idols] gives us no advantage; neither do we come short or become any worse if we do not eat [it]. -- 1 corinthians 8:8
.
Only be careful that this power of choice (this permission and liberty to do as you please) which is yours, does not [somehow] become a hindrance (cause of stumbling) to the weak or overscrupulous [giving them an impulse to sin]. -- 1 corinthians 8:9
.
For suppose someone sees you, a man having knowledge [of God, with an intelligent view of this subject and] reclining at table in an idol's temple, might he not be encouraged and emboldened [to violate his own conscientious scruples] if he is weak and uncertain, and eat what [to him] is for the purpose of idol worship? -- 1 corinthians 8:10
.
And so by your enlightenment (your knowledge of spiritual things), this weak man is ruined (is lost and perishes)--the brother for whom Christ (the Messiah) died! -- 1 corinthians 8:11
.
And when you sin against your brethren in this way, wounding and damaging their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. -- 1 corinthians 8:12
.
Therefore, if [my eating a] food is a cause of my brother's falling or of hindering [his spiritual advancement], I will not eat [such] flesh forever, lest I cause my brother to be tripped up and fall and to be offended. -- 1 corinthians 8:13
.
AM I not an apostle (a special messenger)? Am I not free (unrestrained and exempt from any obligation)? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you [yourselves] not [the product and proof of] my workmanship in the Lord? -- 1 corinthians 9:1
.
Even if I am not considered an apostle (a special messenger) by others, at least I am one to you; for you are the seal (the certificate, the living evidence) of my apostleship in the Lord [confirming and authenticating it]. -- 1 corinthians 9:2
.
This is my [real ground of] defense (my vindication of myself) to those who would put me on trial and cross-examine me. -- 1 corinthians 9:3
.
Have we not the right to our food and drink [at the expense of the churches]? -- 1 corinthians 9:4
.
Have we not the right also to take along with us a Christian sister as wife, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas (Peter)? -- 1 corinthians 9:5
.
Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from doing manual labor for a livelihood [in order to go about the work of the ministry]? -- 1 corinthians 9:6
.
[Consider this:] What soldier at any time serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of the fruit of it? Who tends a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock? -- 1 corinthians 9:7
.
Do I say this only on human authority and as a man reasons? Does not the Law endorse the same principle? -- 1 corinthians 9:8
.
For in the Law of Moses it is written, You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn. Is it [only] for oxen that God cares? -- 1 corinthians 9:9
.
Or does He speak certainly and entirely for our sakes? [Assuredly] it is written for our sakes, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher ought to thresh in expectation of partaking of the harvest. -- 1 corinthians 9:10
.
If we have sown [the seed of] spiritual good among you, [is it too] much if we reap from your material benefits? -- 1 corinthians 9:11
.
If others share in this rightful claim upon you, do not we [have a still better and greater claim]? However, we have never exercised this right, but we endure everything rather than put a hindrance in the way [of the spread] of the good news (the Gospel) of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 9:12
.
Do you not know that those men who are employed in the services of the temple get their food from the temple? And that those who tend the altar share with the altar [in the offerings brought]? -- 1 corinthians 9:13
.
[On the same principle] the Lord directed that those who publish the good news (the Gospel) should live (get their maintenance) by the Gospel. -- 1 corinthians 9:14
.
But I have not made use of any of these privileges, nor am I writing this [to suggest] that any such provision be made for me [now]. For it would be better for me to die than to have anyone make void and deprive me of my [ground for] glorifying [in this matter]. -- 1 corinthians 9:15
.
For if I [merely] preach the Gospel, that gives me no reason to boast, for I feel compelled of necessity to do it. Woe is me if I do not preach the glad tidings (the Gospel)! -- 1 corinthians 9:16
.
For if I do this work of my own free will, then I have my pay (my reward); but if it is not of my own will, but is done reluctantly and under compulsion, I am [still] entrusted with a [sacred] trusteeship and commission. -- 1 corinthians 9:17
.
What then is the [actual] reward that I get? Just this: that in my preaching the good news (the Gospel), I may offer it [absolutely] free of expense [to anybody], not taking advantage of my rights and privileges [as a preacher] of the Gospel. -- 1 corinthians 9:18
.
For although I am free in every way from anyone's control, I have made myself a bond servant to everyone, so that I might gain the more [for Christ]. -- 1 corinthians 9:19
.
To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to men under the Law, [I became] as one under the Law, though not myself being under the Law, that I might win those under the Law. -- 1 corinthians 9:20
.
To those without (outside) law I became as one without law, not that I am without the law of God and lawless toward Him, but that I am [especially keeping] within and committed to the law of Christ, that I might win those who are without law. -- 1 corinthians 9:21
.
To the weak (wanting in discernment) I have become weak (wanting in discernment) that I might win the weak and overscrupulous. I have [in short] become all things to all men, that I might by all means (at all costs and in any and every way) save some [by winning them to faith in Jesus Christ]. -- 1 corinthians 9:22
.
And I do this for the sake of the good news (the Gospel), in order that I may become a participator in it and share in its [blessings along with you]. -- 1 corinthians 9:23
.
Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but [only] one receives the prize? So run [your race] that you may lay hold [of the prize] and make it yours. -- 1 corinthians 9:24
.
Now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperately and restricts himself in all things. They do it to win a wreath that will soon wither, but we [do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness] that cannot wither. -- 1 corinthians 9:25
.
Therefore I do not run uncertainly (without definite aim). I do not box like one beating the air and striking without an adversary. -- 1 corinthians 9:26
.
But [like a boxer] I buffet my body [handle it roughly, discipline it by hardships] and subdue it, for fear that after proclaiming to others the Gospel and things pertaining to it, I myself should become unfit [not stand the test, be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit]. -- 1 corinthians 9:27
.
FOR I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, that our forefathers were all under and protected by the cloud [in which God's Presence went before them], and every one of them passed safely through the [Red] Sea, -- 1 corinthians 10:1
.
And each one of them [allowed himself also] to be baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea [they were thus brought under obligation to the Law, to Moses, and to the covenant, consecrated and set apart to the service of God]; -- 1 corinthians 10:2
.
And all [of them] ate the same spiritual (supernaturally given) food, -- 1 corinthians 10:3
.
And they all drank the same spiritual (supernaturally given) drink. For they drank from a spiritual Rock which followed them [produced by the sole power of God Himself without natural instrumentality], and the Rock was Christ. -- 1 corinthians 10:4
.
Nevertheless, God was not pleased with the great majority of them, for they were overthrown and strewn down along [the ground] in the wilderness. -- 1 corinthians 10:5
.
Now these things are examples (warnings and admonitions) for us not to desire or crave or covet or lust after evil and carnal things as they did. -- 1 corinthians 10:6
.
Do not be worshipers of false gods as some of them were, as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink [the sacrifices offered to the golden calf at Horeb] and rose to sport (to dance and give way to jesting and hilarity). -- 1 corinthians 10:7
.
We must not gratify evil desire and indulge in immorality as some of them did--and twenty-three thousand [suddenly] fell dead in a single day! -- 1 corinthians 10:8
.
We should not tempt the Lord [try His patience, become a trial to Him, critically appraise Him, and exploit His goodness] as some of them did--and were killed by poisonous serpents; -- 1 corinthians 10:9
.
Nor discontentedly complain as some of them did--and were put out of the way entirely by the destroyer (death). -- 1 corinthians 10:10
.
Now these things befell them by way of a figure [as an example and warning to us]; they were written to admonish and fit us for right action by good instruction, we in whose days the ages have reached their climax (their consummation and concluding period). -- 1 corinthians 10:11
.
Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands [who feels sure that he has a steadfast mind and is standing firm], take heed lest he fall [into sin]. -- 1 corinthians 10:12
.
For no temptation (no trial regarded as enticing to sin), [no matter how it comes or where it leads] has overtaken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man [that is, no temptation or trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance and that is not adjusted and adapted and belonging to human experience, and such as man can bear]. But God is faithful [to His Word and to His compassionate nature], and He [can be trusted] not to let you be tempted and tried and assayed beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure, but with the temptation He will [always] also provide the way out (the means of escape to a landing place), that you may be capable and strong and powerful to bear up under it patiently. -- 1 corinthians 10:13
.
Therefore, my dearly beloved, shun (keep clear away from, avoid by flight if need be) any sort of idolatry (of loving or venerating anything more than God). -- 1 corinthians 10:14
.
I am speaking as to intelligent (sensible) men. Think over and make up your minds [for yourselves] about what I say. [I appeal to your reason and your discernment in these matters.] -- 1 corinthians 10:15
.
The cup of blessing [of wine at the Lord's Supper] upon which we ask [God's] blessing, does it not mean [that in drinking it] we participate in and share a fellowship (a communion) in the blood of Christ (the Messiah)? The bread which we break, does it not mean [that in eating it] we participate in and share a fellowship (a communion) in the body of Christ? -- 1 corinthians 10:16
.
For we [no matter how] numerous we are, are one body, because we all partake of the one Bread [the One Whom the communion bread represents]. -- 1 corinthians 10:17
.
Consider those [physically] people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners of the altar [united in their worship of the same God]? -- 1 corinthians 10:18
.
What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is [intrinsically changed by the fact and amounts to] anything or that an idol itself is a [living] thing? -- 1 corinthians 10:19
.
No, I am suggesting that what the pagans sacrifice they offer [in effect] to demons (to evil spiritual powers) and not to God [at all]. I do not want you to fellowship and be partners with diabolical spirits [by eating at their feasts]. -- 1 corinthians 10:20
.
You cannot drink the Lord's cup and the demons' cup. You cannot partake of the Lord's table and the demons' table. -- 1 corinthians 10:21
.
Shall we thus provoke the Lord to jealousy and anger and indignation? Are we stronger than He [that we should defy Him]? -- 1 corinthians 10:22
.
All things are legitimate [permissible--and we are free to do anything we please], but not all things are helpful (expedient, profitable, and wholesome). All things are legitimate, but not all things are constructive [to character] and edifying [to spiritual life]. -- 1 corinthians 10:23
.
Let no one then seek his own good and advantage and profit, but [rather] each one of the other [let him seek the welfare of his neighbor]. -- 1 corinthians 10:24
.
[As to meat offered to idols] eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising any question or investigating on the grounds of conscientious scruples, -- 1 corinthians 10:25
.
For the [whole] earth is the Lord's and everything that is in it. -- 1 corinthians 10:26
.
In case one of the unbelievers invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is served to you without examining into its source because of conscientious scruples. -- 1 corinthians 10:27
.
But if someone tells you, This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol, do not eat it, out of consideration for the person who informed you, and for conscience's sake-- -- 1 corinthians 10:28
.
I mean for the sake of his conscience, not yours, [do not eat it]. For why should another man's scruples apply to me and my liberty of action be determined by his conscience? -- 1 corinthians 10:29
.
If I partake [of my food] with thankfulness, why am I accused and spoken evil of because of that for which I give thanks? -- 1 corinthians 10:30
.
So then, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you may do, do all for the honor and glory of God. -- 1 corinthians 10:31
.
Do not let yourselves be [hindrances by giving] an offense to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God [do not lead others into sin by your mode of life]; -- 1 corinthians 10:32
.
Just as I myself strive to please [to accommodate myself to the opinions, desires, and interests of others, adapting myself to] all men in everything I do, not aiming at or considering my own profit and advantage, but that of the many in order that they may be saved. -- 1 corinthians 10:33
.
PATTERN YOURSELVES after me [follow my example], as I imitate and follow Christ (the Messiah). -- 1 corinthians 11:1
.
I appreciate and commend you because you always remember me in everything and keep firm possession of the traditions (the substance of my instructions), just as I have [verbally] passed them on to you. -- 1 corinthians 11:2
.
But I want you to know and realize that Christ is the Head of every man, the head of a woman is her husband, and the Head of Christ is God. -- 1 corinthians 11:3
.
Any man who prays or prophesies (teaches, refutes, reproves, admonishes, and comforts) with his head covered dishonors his Head (Christ). -- 1 corinthians 11:4
.
And any woman who [publicly] prays or prophesies (teaches, refutes, reproves, admonishes, or comforts) when she is bareheaded dishonors her head (her husband); it is the same as [if her head were] shaved. -- 1 corinthians 11:5
.
For if a woman will not wear [a head] covering, then she should cut off her hair too; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaven, let her cover [her head]. -- 1 corinthians 11:6
.
For a man ought not to wear anything on his head [in church], for he is the image and [reflected] glory of God [his function of government reflects the majesty of the divine Rule]; but woman is [the expression of] man's glory (majesty, preeminence). -- 1 corinthians 11:7
.
For man was not [created] from woman, but woman from man; -- 1 corinthians 11:8
.
Neither was man created on account of or for the benefit of woman, but woman on account of and for the benefit of man. -- 1 corinthians 11:9
.
Therefore she should [be subject to his authority and should] have a covering on her head [as a token, a symbol, of her submission to authority, that she may show reverence as do] the angels [and not displease them]. -- 1 corinthians 11:10
.
Nevertheless, in [the plan of] the Lord and from His point of view woman is not apart from and independent of man, nor is man aloof from and independent of woman; -- 1 corinthians 11:11
.
For as woman was made from man, even so man is also born of woman; and all [whether male or female go forth] from God [as their Author]. -- 1 corinthians 11:12
.
Consider for yourselves; is it proper and decent [according to your customs] for a woman to offer prayer to God [publicly] with her head uncovered? -- 1 corinthians 11:13
.
Does not the native sense of propriety (experience, common sense, reason) itself teach you that for a man to wear long hair is a dishonor [humiliating and degrading] to him, -- 1 corinthians 11:14
.
But if a woman has long hair, it is her ornament and glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. -- 1 corinthians 11:15
.
Now if anyone is disposed to be argumentative and contentious about this, we hold to and recognize no other custom [in worship] than this, nor do the churches of God generally. -- 1 corinthians 11:16
.
But in what I instruct [you] next I do not commend [you], because when you meet together, it is not for the better but for the worse. -- 1 corinthians 11:17
.
For in the first place, when you assemble as a congregation, I hear that there are cliques (divisions and factions) among you; and I in part believe it, -- 1 corinthians 11:18
.
For doubtless there have to be factions or parties among you in order that they who are genuine and of approved fitness may become evident and plainly recognized among you. -- 1 corinthians 11:19
.
So when you gather for your meetings, it is not the supper instituted by the Lord that you eat, -- 1 corinthians 11:20
.
For in eating each one [hurries] to get his own supper first [not waiting for the poor], and one goes hungry while another gets drunk. -- 1 corinthians 11:21
.
What! Do you have no houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and mean to show contempt for it, while you humiliate those who are poor (have no homes and have brought no food)? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, [most certainly] I will not! -- 1 corinthians 11:22
.
For I received from the Lord Himself that which I passed on to you [it was given to me personally], that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was treacherously delivered up and while His betrayal was in progress took bread, -- 1 corinthians 11:23
.
And when He had given thanks, He broke [it] and said, Take, eat. This is My body, which is broken for you. Do this to call Me [affectionately] to remembrance. -- 1 corinthians 11:24
.
Similarly when supper was ended, He took the cup also, saying, This cup is the new covenant [ratified and established] in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink [it], to call Me [affectionately] to remembrance. -- 1 corinthians 11:25
.
For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are representing and signifying and proclaiming the fact of the Lord's death until He comes [again]. -- 1 corinthians 11:26
.
So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [of Him] will be guilty of [profaning and sinning against] the body and blood of the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 11:27
.
Let a man [thoroughly] examine himself, and [only when he has done] so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup. -- 1 corinthians 11:28
.
For anyone who eats and drinks without discriminating and recognizing with due appreciation that [it is Christ's] body, eats and drinks a sentence (a verdict of judgment) upon himself. -- 1 corinthians 11:29
.
That [careless and unworthy participation] is the reason many of you are weak and sickly, and quite enough of you have fallen into the sleep of death. -- 1 corinthians 11:30
.
For if we searchingly examined ourselves [detecting our shortcomings and recognizing our own condition], we should not be judged and penalty decreed [by the divine judgment]. -- 1 corinthians 11:31
.
But when we [fall short and] are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined and chastened, so that we may not [finally] be condemned [to eternal punishment along] with the world. -- 1 corinthians 11:32
.
So then, my brothers, when you gather together to eat [the Lord's Supper], wait for one another. -- 1 corinthians 11:33
.
If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together to bring judgment [on yourselves]. About the other matters, I will give you directions [personally] when I come. -- 1 corinthians 11:34
.
NOW ABOUT the spiritual gifts (the special endowments of supernatural energy), brethren, I do not want you to be misinformed. -- 1 corinthians 12:1
.
You know that when you were heathen, you were led off after idols that could not speak [habitually] as impulse directed and whenever the occasion might arise. -- 1 corinthians 12:2
.
Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking under the power and influence of the [Holy] Spirit of God can [ever] say, Jesus be cursed! And no one can [really] say, Jesus is [my] Lord, except by and under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit. -- 1 corinthians 12:3
.
Now there are distinctive varieties and distributions of endowments (gifts, extraordinary powers distinguishing certain Christians, due to the power of divine grace operating in their souls by the Holy Spirit) and they vary, but the [Holy] Spirit remains the same. -- 1 corinthians 12:4
.
And there are distinctive varieties of service and ministration, but it is the same Lord [Who is served]. -- 1 corinthians 12:5
.
And there are distinctive varieties of operation [of working to accomplish things], but it is the same God Who inspires and energizes them all in all. -- 1 corinthians 12:6
.
But to each one is given the manifestation of the [Holy] Spirit [the evidence, the spiritual illumination of the Spirit] for good and profit. -- 1 corinthians 12:7
.
To one is given in and through the [Holy] Spirit [the power to speak] a message of wisdom, and to another [the power to express] a word of knowledge and understanding according to the same [Holy] Spirit; -- 1 corinthians 12:8
.
To another [wonder-working] faith by the same [Holy] Spirit, to another the extraordinary powers of healing by the one Spirit; -- 1 corinthians 12:9
.
To another the working of miracles, to another prophetic insight (the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose); to another the ability to discern and distinguish between [the utterances of true] spirits [and false ones], to another various kinds of [unknown] tongues, to another the ability to interpret [such] tongues. -- 1 corinthians 12:10
.
All these [gifts, achievements, abilities] are inspired and brought to pass by one and the same [Holy] Spirit, Who apportions to each person individually [exactly] as He chooses. -- 1 corinthians 12:11
.
For just as the body is a unity and yet has many parts, and all the parts, though many, form [only] one body, so it is with Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- 1 corinthians 12:12
.
For by [means of the personal agency of] one [Holy] Spirit we were all, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, baptized [and by baptism united together] into one body, and all made to drink of one [Holy] Spirit. -- 1 corinthians 12:13
.
For the body does not consist of one limb or organ but of many. -- 1 corinthians 12:14
.
If the foot should say, Because I am not the hand, I do not belong to the body, would it be therefore not [a part] of the body? -- 1 corinthians 12:15
.
If the ear should say, Because I am not the eye, I do not belong to the body, would it be therefore not [a part] of the body? -- 1 corinthians 12:16
.
If the whole body were an eye, where [would be the sense of] hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where [would be the sense of] smell? -- 1 corinthians 12:17
.
But as it is, God has placed and arranged the limbs and organs in the body, each [particular one] of them, just as He wished and saw fit and with the best adaptation. -- 1 corinthians 12:18
.
But if [the whole] were all a single organ, where would the body be? -- 1 corinthians 12:19
.
And now there are [certainly] many limbs and organs, but a single body. -- 1 corinthians 12:20
.
And the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you, nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. -- 1 corinthians 12:21
.
But instead, there is [absolute] necessity for the parts of the body that are considered the more weak. -- 1 corinthians 12:22
.
And those [parts] of the body which we consider rather ignoble are [the very parts] which we invest with additional honor, and our unseemly parts and those unsuitable for exposure are treated with seemliness (modesty and decorum), -- 1 corinthians 12:23
.
Which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so adjusted (mingled, harmonized, and subtly proportioned the parts of) the whole body, giving the greater honor and richer endowment to the inferior parts which lack [apparent importance], -- 1 corinthians 12:24
.
So that there should be no division or discord or lack of adaptation [of the parts of the body to each other], but the members all alike should have a mutual interest in and care for one another. -- 1 corinthians 12:25
.
And if one member suffers, all the parts [share] the suffering; if one member is honored, all the members [share in] the enjoyment of it. -- 1 corinthians 12:26
.
Now you [collectively] are Christ's body and [individually] you are members of it, each part severally and distinct [each with his own place and function]. -- 1 corinthians 12:27
.
So God has appointed some in the church [for His own use]: first apostles (special messengers); second prophets (inspired preachers and expounders); third teachers; then wonder-workers; then those with ability to heal the sick; helpers; administrators; [speakers in] different (unknown) tongues. -- 1 corinthians 12:28
.
Are all apostles (special messengers)? Are all prophets (inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God)? Are all teachers? Do all have the power of performing miracles? -- 1 corinthians 12:29
.
Do all possess extraordinary powers of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? -- 1 corinthians 12:30
.
But earnestly desire and zealously cultivate the greatest and best gifts and graces (the higher gifts and the choicest graces). And yet I will show you a still more excellent way [one that is better by far and the highest of them all--love]. -- 1 corinthians 12:31
.
IF I [can] speak in the tongues of men and [even] of angels, but have not love (that reasoning, intentional, spiritual devotion such as is inspired by God's love for and in us), I am only a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. -- 1 corinthians 13:1
.
And if I have prophetic powers (the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose), and understand all the secret truths and mysteries and possess all knowledge, and if I have [sufficient] faith so that I can remove mountains, but have not love (God's love in me) I am nothing (a useless nobody). -- 1 corinthians 13:2
.
Even if I dole out all that I have [to the poor in providing] food, and if I surrender my body to be burned or in order that I may glory, but have not love (God's love in me), I gain nothing. -- 1 corinthians 13:3
.
Love endures long and is patient and kind; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy, is not boastful or vainglorious, does not display itself haughtily. -- 1 corinthians 13:4
.
It is not conceited (arrogant and inflated with pride); it is not rude (unmannerly) and does not act unbecomingly. Love (God's love in us) does not insist on its own rights or its own way, for it is not self-seeking; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it [it pays no attention to a suffered wrong]. -- 1 corinthians 13:5
.
It does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness, but rejoices when right and truth prevail. -- 1 corinthians 13:6
.
Love bears up under anything and everything that comes, is ever ready to believe the best of every person, its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances, and it endures everything [without weakening]. -- 1 corinthians 13:7
.
Love never fails [never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end]. As for prophecy (the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose), it will be fulfilled and pass away; as for tongues, they will be destroyed and cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away [it will lose its value and be superseded by truth]. -- 1 corinthians 13:8
.
For our knowledge is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect), and our prophecy (our teaching) is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect). -- 1 corinthians 13:9
.
But when the complete and perfect (total) comes, the incomplete and imperfect will vanish away (become antiquated, void, and superseded). -- 1 corinthians 13:10
.
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; now that I have become a man, I am done with childish ways and have put them aside. -- 1 corinthians 13:11
.
For now we are looking in a mirror that gives only a dim (blurred) reflection [of reality as in a riddle or enigma], but then [when perfection comes] we shall see in reality and face to face! Now I know in part (imperfectly), but then I shall know and understand fully and clearly, even in the same manner as I have been fully and clearly known and understood [by God]. -- 1 corinthians 13:12
.
And so faith, hope, love abide [faith--conviction and belief respecting man's relation to God and divine things; hope--joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation; love--true affection for God and man, growing out of God's love for and in us], these three; but the greatest of these is love. -- 1 corinthians 13:13
.
EAGERLY PURSUE and seek to acquire [this] love [make it your aim, your great quest]; and earnestly desire and cultivate the spiritual endowments (gifts), especially that you may prophesy (interpret the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching). -- 1 corinthians 14:1
.
For one who speaks in an [unknown] tongue speaks not to men but to God, for no one understands or catches his meaning, because in the [Holy] Spirit he utters secret truths and hidden things [not obvious to the understanding]. -- 1 corinthians 14:2
.
But [on the other hand], the one who prophesies [who interprets the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching] speaks to men for their upbuilding and constructive spiritual progress and encouragement and consolation. -- 1 corinthians 14:3
.
He who speaks in a [strange] tongue edifies and improves himself, but he who prophesies [interpreting the divine will and purpose and teaching with inspiration] edifies and improves the church and promotes growth [in Christian wisdom, piety, holiness, and happiness]. -- 1 corinthians 14:4
.
Now I wish that you might all speak in [unknown] tongues, but more especially [I want you] to prophesy (to be inspired to preach and interpret the divine will and purpose). He who prophesies [who is inspired to preach and teach] is greater (more useful and more important) than he who speaks in [unknown] tongues, unless he should interpret [what he says], so that the church may be edified and receive good [from it]. -- 1 corinthians 14:5
.
Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in [unknown] tongues, how shall I make it to your advantage unless I speak to you either in revelation (disclosure of God's will to man) in knowledge or in prophecy or in instruction? -- 1 corinthians 14:6
.
If even inanimate musical instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone [listening] know or understand what is played? -- 1 corinthians 14:7
.
And if the war bugle gives an uncertain (indistinct) call, who will prepare for battle? -- 1 corinthians 14:8
.
Just so it is with you; if you in the [unknown] tongue speak words that are not intelligible, how will anyone understand what you are saying? For you will be talking into empty space! -- 1 corinthians 14:9
.
There are, I suppose, all these many [to us unknown] tongues in the world [somewhere], and none is destitute of [its own power of] expression and meaning. -- 1 corinthians 14:10
.
But if I do not know the force and significance of the speech (language), I shall seem to be a foreigner to the one who speaks [to me], and the speaker who addresses [me] will seem a foreigner to me. -- 1 corinthians 14:11
.
So it is with yourselves; since you are so eager and ambitious to possess spiritual endowments and manifestations of the [Holy] Spirit, [concentrate on] striving to excel and to abound [in them] in ways that will build up the church. -- 1 corinthians 14:12
.
Therefore, the person who speaks in an [unknown] tongue should pray [for the power] to interpret and explain what he says. -- 1 corinthians 14:13
.
For if I pray in an [unknown] tongue, my spirit [by the Holy Spirit within me] prays, but my mind is unproductive [it bears no fruit and helps nobody]. -- 1 corinthians 14:14
.
Then what am I to do? I will pray with my spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me], but I will also pray [intelligently] with my mind and understanding; I will sing with my spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me], but I will sing [intelligently] with my mind and understanding also. -- 1 corinthians 14:15
.
Otherwise, if you bless and render thanks with [your] spirit [thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit], how can anyone in the position of an outsider or he who is not gifted with [interpreting of unknown] tongues, say the Amen to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? [I Chron. 16:36; Ps. 106:48.] -- 1 corinthians 14:16
.
To be sure, you may give thanks well (nobly), but the bystander is not edified [it does him no good]. -- 1 corinthians 14:17
.
I thank God that I speak in [strange] tongues (languages) more than any of you or all of you put together; -- 1 corinthians 14:18
.
Nevertheless, in public worship, I would rather say five words with my understanding and intelligently in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a [strange] tongue (language). -- 1 corinthians 14:19
.
Brethren, do not be children [immature] in your thinking; continue to be babes in [matters of] evil, but in your minds be mature [men]. -- 1 corinthians 14:20
.
It is written in the Law, By men of strange languages and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and not even then will they listen to Me, says the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 14:21
.
Thus [unknown] tongues are meant for a [supernatural] sign, not for believers but for unbelievers [on the point of believing], while prophecy (inspired preaching and teaching, interpreting the divine will and purpose) is not for unbelievers [on the point of believing] but for believers. -- 1 corinthians 14:22
.
Therefore, if the whole church assembles and all of you speak in [unknown] tongues, and the ungifted and uninitiated or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are demented? -- 1 corinthians 14:23
.
But if all prophesy [giving inspired testimony and interpreting the divine will and purpose] and an unbeliever or untaught outsider comes in, he is told of his sin and reproved and convicted and convinced by all, and his defects and needs are examined (estimated, determined) and he is called to account by all, -- 1 corinthians 14:24
.
The secrets of his heart are laid bare; and so, falling on [his] face, he will worship God, declaring that God is among you in very truth. -- 1 corinthians 14:25
.
What then, brethren, is [the right course]? When you meet together, each one has a hymn, a teaching, a disclosure of special knowledge or information, an utterance in a [strange] tongue, or an interpretation of it. [But] let everything be constructive and edifying and for the good of all. -- 1 corinthians 14:26
.
If some speak in a [strange] tongue, let the number be limited to two or at the most three, and each one [taking his] turn, and let one interpret and explain [what is said]. -- 1 corinthians 14:27
.
But if there is no one to do the interpreting, let each of them keep still in church and talk to himself and to God. -- 1 corinthians 14:28
.
So let two or three prophets speak [those inspired to preach or teach], while the rest pay attention and weigh and discern what is said. -- 1 corinthians 14:29
.
But if an inspired revelation comes to another who is sitting by, then let the first one be silent. -- 1 corinthians 14:30
.
For in this way you can give testimony [prophesying and thus interpreting the divine will and purpose] one by one, so that all may be instructed and all may be stimulated and encouraged; -- 1 corinthians 14:31
.
For the spirits of the prophets (the speakers in tongues) are under the speaker's control [and subject to being silenced as may be necessary], -- 1 corinthians 14:32
.
For He [Who is the source of their prophesying] is not a God of confusion and disorder but of peace and order. As [is the practice] in all the churches of the saints (God's people), -- 1 corinthians 14:33
.
The women should keep quiet in the churches, for they are not authorized to speak, but should take a secondary and subordinate place, just as the Law also says. -- 1 corinthians 14:34
.
But if there is anything they want to learn, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to talk in church [for her to usurp and exercise authority over men in the church]. -- 1 corinthians 14:35
.
What! Did the word of the Lord originate with you [Corinthians], or has it reached only you? -- 1 corinthians 14:36
.
If anyone thinks and claims that he is a prophet [filled with and governed by the Holy Spirit of God and inspired to interpret the divine will and purpose in preaching or teaching] or has any other spiritual endowment, let him understand (recognize and acknowledge) that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 14:37
.
But if anyone disregards or does not recognize [that it is a command of the Lord], he is disregarded and not recognized [he is one whom God knows not]. -- 1 corinthians 14:38
.
So [to conclude], my brethren, earnestly desire and set your hearts on prophesying (on being inspired to preach and teach and to interpret God's will and purpose), and do not forbid or hinder speaking in [unknown] tongues. -- 1 corinthians 14:39
.
But all things should be done with regard to decency and propriety and in an orderly fashion. -- 1 corinthians 14:40
.
AND NOW let me remind you [since it seems to have escaped you], brethren, of the Gospel (the glad tidings of salvation) which I proclaimed to you, which you welcomed and accepted and upon which your faith rests, -- 1 corinthians 15:1
.
And by which you are saved, if you hold fast and keep firmly what I preached to you, unless you believed at first without effect and all for nothing. -- 1 corinthians 15:2
.
For I passed on to you first of all what I also had received, that Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) died for our sins in accordance with [what] the Scriptures [foretold], -- 1 corinthians 15:3
.
That He was buried, that He arose on the third day as the Scriptures foretold, -- 1 corinthians 15:4
.
And [also] that He appeared to Cephas (Peter), then to the Twelve. -- 1 corinthians 15:5
.
Then later He showed Himself to more than five hundred brethren at one time, the majority of whom are still alive, but some have fallen asleep [in death]. -- 1 corinthians 15:6
.
Afterward He was seen by James, then by all the apostles (the special messengers), -- 1 corinthians 15:7
.
And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one prematurely and born dead [no better than an unperfected fetus among living men]. -- 1 corinthians 15:8
.
For I am the least [worthy] of the apostles, who am not fit or deserving to be called an apostle, because I once wronged and pursued and molested the church of God [oppressing it with cruelty and violence]. -- 1 corinthians 15:9
.
But by the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not [found to be] for nothing (fruitless and without effect). In fact, I worked harder than all of them [the apostles], though it was not really I, but the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God which was with me. -- 1 corinthians 15:10
.
So, whether then it was I or they, this is what we preach and this is what you believed [what you adhered to, trusted in, and relied on]. -- 1 corinthians 15:11
.
But now if Christ (the Messiah) is preached as raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? -- 1 corinthians 15:12
.
But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not risen; -- 1 corinthians 15:13
.
And if Christ has not risen, then our preaching is in vain [it amounts to nothing] and your faith is devoid of truth and is fruitless (without effect, empty, imaginary, and unfounded). -- 1 corinthians 15:14
.
We are even discovered to be misrepresenting God, for we testified of Him that He raised Christ, Whom He did not raise in case it is true that the dead are not raised. -- 1 corinthians 15:15
.
For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised; -- 1 corinthians 15:16
.
And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is mere delusion [futile, fruitless], and you are still in your sins [under the control and penalty of sin]; -- 1 corinthians 15:17
.
And further, those who have died in [spiritual fellowship and union with] Christ have perished (are lost)! -- 1 corinthians 15:18
.
If we who are [abiding] in Christ have hope only in this life and that is all, then we are of all people most miserable and to be pitied. -- 1 corinthians 15:19
.
But the fact is that Christ (the Messiah) has been raised from the dead, and He became the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep [in death]. -- 1 corinthians 15:20
.
For since [it was] through a man that death [came into the world, it is] also through a Man that the resurrection of the dead [has come]. -- 1 corinthians 15:21
.
For just as [because of their union of nature] in Adam all people die, so also [by virtue of their union of nature] shall all in Christ be made alive. -- 1 corinthians 15:22
.
But each in his own rank and turn: Christ (the Messiah) [is] the firstfruits, then those who are Christ's [own will be resurrected] at His coming. -- 1 corinthians 15:23
.
After that comes the end (the completion), when He delivers over the kingdom to God the Father after rendering inoperative and abolishing every [other] rule and every authority and power. -- 1 corinthians 15:24
.
For [Christ] must be King and reign until He has put all [His] enemies under His feet. -- 1 corinthians 15:25
.
The last enemy to be subdued and abolished is death. -- 1 corinthians 15:26
.
For He [the Father] has put all things in subjection under His [Christ's] feet. But when it says, All things are put in subjection [under Him], it is evident that He [Himself] is excepted Who does the subjecting of all things to Him. -- 1 corinthians 15:27
.
However, when everything is subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also subject Himself to [the Father] Who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all [be everything to everyone, supreme, the indwelling and controlling factor of life]. -- 1 corinthians 15:28
.
Otherwise, what do people mean by being [themselves] baptized in behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? -- 1 corinthians 15:29
.
[For that matter], why do I live [dangerously as I do, running such risks that I am] in peril every hour? -- 1 corinthians 15:30
.
[I assure you] by the pride which I have in you in [your fellowship and union with] Christ Jesus our Lord, that I die daily [I face death every day and die to self]. -- 1 corinthians 15:31
.
What do I gain if, merely from the human point of view, I fought with [wild] beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised [at all], let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will be dead. -- 1 corinthians 15:32
.
Do not be so deceived and misled! Evil companionships (communion, associations) corrupt and deprave good manners and morals and character. -- 1 corinthians 15:33
.
Awake [from your drunken stupor and return] to sober sense and your right minds, and sin no more. For some of you have not the knowledge of God [you are utterly and willfully and disgracefully ignorant, and continue to be so, lacking the sense of God's presence and all true knowledge of Him]. I say this to your shame. -- 1 corinthians 15:34
.
But someone will say, How can the dead be raised? With what [kind of] body will they come forth? -- 1 corinthians 15:35
.
You foolish man! Every time you plant seed, you sow something that does not come to life [germinating, springing up, and growing] unless it dies first. -- 1 corinthians 15:36
.
Nor is the seed you sow then the body which it is going to have [later], but it is a naked kernel, perhaps of wheat or some of the rest of the grains. -- 1 corinthians 15:37
.
But God gives to it the body that He plans and sees fit, and to each kind of seed a body of its own. -- 1 corinthians 15:38
.
For all flesh is not the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fish. -- 1 corinthians 15:39
.
There are heavenly bodies (sun, moon, and stars) and there are earthly bodies (men, animals, and plants), but the beauty and glory of the heavenly bodies is of one kind, while the beauty and glory of earthly bodies is a different kind. -- 1 corinthians 15:40
.
The sun is glorious in one way, the moon is glorious in another way, and the stars are glorious in their own [distinctive] way; for one star differs from and surpasses another in its beauty and brilliance. -- 1 corinthians 15:41
.
So it is with the resurrection of the dead. [The body] that is sown is perishable and decays, but [the body] that is resurrected is imperishable (immune to decay, immortal). -- 1 corinthians 15:42
.
It is sown in dishonor and humiliation; it is raised in honor and glory. It is sown in infirmity and weakness; it is resurrected in strength and endued with power. -- 1 corinthians 15:43
.
It is sown a natural (physical) body; it is raised a supernatural (a spiritual) body. [As surely as] there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. -- 1 corinthians 15:44
.
Thus it is written, The first man Adam became a living being (an individual personality); the last Adam (Christ) became a life-giving Spirit [restoring the dead to life]. -- 1 corinthians 15:45
.
But it is not the spiritual life which came first, but the physical and then the spiritual. -- 1 corinthians 15:46
.
The first man [was] from out of earth, made of dust (earthly-minded); the second Man [is] the Lord from out of heaven. -- 1 corinthians 15:47
.
Now those who are made of the dust are like him who was first made of the dust (earthly-minded); and as is [the Man] from heaven, so also [are those] who are of heaven (heavenly-minded). -- 1 corinthians 15:48
.
And just as we have borne the image [of the man] of dust, so shall we and so let us also bear the image [of the Man] of heaven. -- 1 corinthians 15:49
.
But I tell you this, brethren, flesh and blood cannot [become partakers of eternal salvation and] inherit or share in the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable (that which is decaying) inherit or share in the imperishable (the immortal). -- 1 corinthians 15:50
.
Take notice! I tell you a mystery (a secret truth, an event decreed by the hidden purpose or counsel of God). We shall not all fall asleep [in death], but we shall all be changed (transformed) -- 1 corinthians 15:51
.
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the [sound of the] last trumpet call. For a trumpet will sound, and the dead [in Christ] will be raised imperishable (free and immune from decay), and we shall be changed (transformed). -- 1 corinthians 15:52
.
For this perishable [part of us] must put on the imperishable [nature], and this mortal [part of us, this nature that is capable of dying] must put on immortality (freedom from death). -- 1 corinthians 15:53
.
And when this perishable puts on the imperishable and this that was capable of dying puts on freedom from death, then shall be fulfilled the Scripture that says, Death is swallowed up (utterly vanquished forever) in and unto victory. -- 1 corinthians 15:54
.
O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? -- 1 corinthians 15:55
.
Now sin is the sting of death, and sin exercises its power [upon the soul] through [the abuse of] the Law. -- 1 corinthians 15:56
.
But thanks be to God, Who gives us the victory [making us conquerors] through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 15:57
.
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be firm (steadfast), immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord [always being superior, excelling, doing more than enough in the service of the Lord], knowing and being continually aware that your labor in the Lord is not futile [it is never wasted or to no purpose]. -- 1 corinthians 15:58
.
NOW CONCERNING the money contributed for [the relief of] the saints (God's people): you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia to do. -- 1 corinthians 16:1
.
On the first [day] of each week, let each one of you [personally] put aside something and save it up as he has prospered [in proportion to what he is given], so that no collections will need to be taken after I come. -- 1 corinthians 16:2
.
And when I arrive, I will send on those whom you approve and authorize with credentials to carry your gift [of charity] to Jerusalem. -- 1 corinthians 16:3
.
If it seems worthwhile that I should go too, they will accompany me. -- 1 corinthians 16:4
.
After passing through Macedonia, I will visit you, for I intend [only] to pass through Macedonia; -- 1 corinthians 16:5
.
But it may be that I will stay with you [for a while], perhaps even spend the winter, so that you may bring me forward [on my journey] to wherever I may go. -- 1 corinthians 16:6
.
For I am unwilling to see you right now [just] in passing, but I hope later to remain for some time with you, if the Lord permits. -- 1 corinthians 16:7
.
I will remain in Ephesus [however] until Pentecost, -- 1 corinthians 16:8
.
For a wide door of opportunity for effectual [service] has opened to me [there, a great and promising one], and [there are] many adversaries. -- 1 corinthians 16:9
.
When Timothy arrives, see to it that [you put him at ease, so that] he may be fearless among you, for he is [devotedly] doing the Lord's work, just as I am. -- 1 corinthians 16:10
.
So [see to it that] no one despises him or treats him as if he were of no account or slights him. But send him off [cordially, speed him on his way] in peace, that he may come to me, for I am expecting him [to come along] with the other brethren. -- 1 corinthians 16:11
.
As for our brother Apollos, I have urgently encouraged him to visit you with the other brethren, but it was not at all his will or God's will that he should go now. He will come when he has opportunity. -- 1 corinthians 16:12
.
Be alert and on your guard; stand firm in your faith (your conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things, keeping the trust and holy fervor born of faith and a part of it). Act like men and be courageous; grow in strength! -- 1 corinthians 16:13
.
Let everything you do be done in love (true love to God and man as inspired by God's love for us). -- 1 corinthians 16:14
.
Now, brethren, you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts and our firstfruits in Achaia (most of Greece), and how they have consecrated and devoted themselves to the service of the saints (God's people). -- 1 corinthians 16:15
.
I urge you to pay all deference to such leaders and to enlist under them and be subject to them, as well as to everyone who joins and cooperates [with you] and labors earnestly. -- 1 corinthians 16:16
.
I am happy because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come [to me], for they have made up for your absence. -- 1 corinthians 16:17
.
For they gave me respite from labor and rested me and refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Deeply appreciate and thoroughly know and fully recognize such men. -- 1 corinthians 16:18
.
The churches of Asia send greetings and best wishes. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church [that meets] in their house, send you their hearty greetings in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 16:19
.
All the brethren wish to be remembered to you and wish you well. Greet one another with a holy kiss. -- 1 corinthians 16:20
.
I, Paul, [add this final] greeting with my own hand. -- 1 corinthians 16:21
.
If anyone does not love the Lord [does not have a friendly affection for Him and is not kindly disposed toward Him], he shall be accursed! Our Lord will come! (Maranatha!) -- 1 corinthians 16:22
.
The grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. -- 1 corinthians 16:23
.
My love (that true love growing out of sincere devotion to God) be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen (so be it). -- 1 corinthians 16:24
.
PAUL, AN apostle (a special messenger) of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, to the church (assembly) of God which is at Corinth, and to all the saints (the people of God) throughout Achaia (most of Greece): -- 2 corinthians 1:1
.
Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- 2 corinthians 1:2
.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of sympathy (pity and mercy) and the God [Who is the Source] of every comfort (consolation and encouragement), -- 2 corinthians 1:3
.
Who comforts (consoles and encourages) us in every trouble (calamity and affliction), so that we may also be able to comfort (console and encourage) those who are in any kind of trouble or distress, with the comfort (consolation and encouragement) with which we ourselves are comforted (consoled and encouraged) by God. -- 2 corinthians 1:4
.
For just as Christ's [own] sufferings fall to our lot [as they overflow upon His disciples, and we share and experience them] abundantly, so through Christ comfort (consolation and encouragement) is also [shared and experienced] abundantly by us. -- 2 corinthians 1:5
.
But if we are troubled (afflicted and distressed), it is for your comfort (consolation and encouragement) and [for your] salvation; and if we are comforted (consoled and encouraged), it is for your comfort (consolation and encouragement), which works [in you] when you patiently endure the same evils (misfortunes and calamities) that we also suffer and undergo. -- 2 corinthians 1:6
.
And our hope for you [our joyful and confident expectation of good for you] is ever unwavering (assured and unshaken); for we know that just as you share and are partners in [our] sufferings and calamities, you also share and are partners in [our] comfort (consolation and encouragement). -- 2 corinthians 1:7
.
For we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about the affliction and oppressing distress which befell us in [the province of] Asia, how we were so utterly and unbearably weighed down and crushed that we despaired even of life [itself]. -- 2 corinthians 1:8
.
Indeed, we felt within ourselves that we had received the [very] sentence of death, but that was to keep us from trusting in and depending on ourselves instead of on God Who raises the dead. -- 2 corinthians 1:9
.
[For it is He] Who rescued and saved us from such a perilous death, and He will still rescue and save us; in and on Him we have set our hope (our joyful and confident expectation) that He will again deliver us [from danger and destruction and draw us to Himself], -- 2 corinthians 1:10
.
While you also cooperate by your prayers for us [helping and laboring together with us]. Thus [the lips of] many persons [turned toward God will eventually] give thanks on our behalf for the grace (the blessing of deliverance) granted us at the request of the many who have prayed. -- 2 corinthians 1:11
.
It is a reason for pride and exultation to which our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world [generally] and especially toward you, with devout and pure motives and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God (the unmerited favor and merciful kindness by which God, exerting His holy influence upon souls, turns them to Christ, and keeps, strengthens, and increases them in Christian virtues). -- 2 corinthians 1:12
.
For we write you nothing else but simply what you can read and understand [there is no double meaning to what we say], and I hope that you will become thoroughly acquainted [with divine things] and know and understand [them] accurately and well to the end, -- 2 corinthians 1:13
.
[Just] as you have [already] partially known and understood and acknowledged us and recognized that you can [honestly] be proud of us, even as we [can be proud] of you on the day of our Lord Jesus. -- 2 corinthians 1:14
.
It was with assurance of this that I wanted and planned to visit you first [of all], so that you might have a double favor and token of grace (goodwill). -- 2 corinthians 1:15
.
[I wanted] to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and [then] to come again to you [on my return trip] from Macedonia and have you send me forward on my way to Judea. -- 2 corinthians 1:16
.
Now because I changed my original plan, was I being unstable and capricious? Or what I plan, do I plan according to the flesh [like a worldly man], ready to say Yes, yes, [when it may mean] No, no? -- 2 corinthians 1:17
.
As surely as God is trustworthy and faithful and means what He says, our speech and message to you have not been Yes [that might mean] No. -- 2 corinthians 1:18
.
For the Son of God, Christ Jesus (the Messiah), Who has been preached among you by us, by myself, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not Yes and No; but in Him it is [always the divine] Yes. -- 2 corinthians 1:19
.
For as many as are the promises of God, they all find their Yes [answer] in Him [Christ]. For this reason we also utter the Amen (so be it) to God through Him [in His Person and by His agency] to the glory of God. -- 2 corinthians 1:20
.
But it is God Who confirms and makes us steadfast and establishes us [in joint fellowship] with you in Christ, and has consecrated and anointed us [enduing us with the gifts of the Holy Spirit]; -- 2 corinthians 1:21
.
[He has also appropriated and acknowledged us as His by] putting His seal upon us and giving us His [Holy] Spirit in our hearts as the security deposit and guarantee [of the fulfillment of His promise]. -- 2 corinthians 1:22
.
But I call upon God as my soul's witness: it was to avoid hurting you that I refrained from coming to Corinth-- -- 2 corinthians 1:23
.
Not that we have dominion [over you] and lord it over your faith, but [rather that we work with you as] fellow laborers [to promote] your joy, for in [your] faith (in your strong and welcome conviction or belief that Jesus is the Messiah, through Whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of God) you stand firm. -- 2 corinthians 1:24
.
BUT I definitely made up my mind not to grieve you with another painful and distressing visit. -- 2 corinthians 2:1
.
For if I cause you pain [with merited rebuke], who is there to provide me enjoyment but the [very] one whom I have grieved and made sad? -- 2 corinthians 2:2
.
And I wrote the same to you so that when I came, I might not be myself pained by those who are the [very] ones who ought to make me glad, for I trusted in you all and felt confident that my joy would be shared by all of you. -- 2 corinthians 2:3
.
For I wrote you out of great sorrow and deep distress [with mental torture and anxiety] of heart, [yes, and] with many tears, not to cause you pain but in order to make you realize the overflowing love that I continue increasingly to have for you. -- 2 corinthians 2:4
.
But if someone [the one among you who committed incest] has caused [all this] grief and pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure, not to put it too severely, [he has distressed] all of you. -- 2 corinthians 2:5
.
For such a one this censure by the majority [which he has received is] sufficient [punishment]. -- 2 corinthians 2:6
.
So [instead of further rebuke, now] you should rather turn and [graciously] forgive and comfort and encourage [him], to keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive sorrow and despair. -- 2 corinthians 2:7
.
I therefore beg you to reinstate him in your affections and assure him of your love for him; -- 2 corinthians 2:8
.
For this was my purpose in writing you, to test your attitude and see if you would stand the test, whether you are obedient and altogether agreeable [to following my orders] in everything. -- 2 corinthians 2:9
.
If you forgive anyone anything, I too forgive that one; and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sakes in the presence [and with the approval] of Christ (the Messiah), -- 2 corinthians 2:10
.
To keep Satan from getting the advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his wiles and intentions. -- 2 corinthians 2:11
.
Now when I arrived at Troas [to preach] the good news (the Gospel) of Christ, a door of opportunity was opened for me in the Lord, -- 2 corinthians 2:12
.
Yet my spirit could not rest (relax, get relief) because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave from them and departed for Macedonia. -- 2 corinthians 2:13
.
But thanks be to God, Who in Christ always leads us in triumph [as trophies of Christ's victory] and through us spreads and makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere, -- 2 corinthians 2:14
.
For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ [which exhales] unto God, [discernible alike] among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing: -- 2 corinthians 2:15
.
To the latter it is an aroma [wafted] from death to death [a fatal odor, the smell of doom]; to the former it is an aroma from life to life [a vital fragrance, living and fresh]. And who is qualified (fit and sufficient) for these things? [Who is able for such a ministry? We?] -- 2 corinthians 2:16
.
For we are not, like so many, [like hucksters making a trade of] peddling God's Word [shortchanging and adulterating the divine message]; but like [men] of sincerity and the purest motive, as [commissioned and sent] by God, we speak [His message] in Christ (the Messiah), in the [very] sight and presence of God. -- 2 corinthians 2:17
.
ARE WE starting to commend ourselves again? Or we do not, like some [false teachers], need written credentials or letters of recommendation to you or from you, [do we]? -- 2 corinthians 3:1
.
[No] you yourselves are our letter of recommendation (our credentials), written in your hearts, to be known (perceived, recognized) and read by everybody. -- 2 corinthians 3:2
.
You show and make obvious that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, not written with ink but with [the] Spirit of [the] living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. -- 2 corinthians 3:3
.
Such is the reliance and confidence that we have through Christ toward and with reference to God. -- 2 corinthians 3:4
.
Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us, but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God. -- 2 corinthians 3:5
.
[It is He] Who has qualified us [making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ], not [ministers] of the letter (of legally written code) but of the Spirit; for the code [of the Law] kills, but the [Holy] Spirit makes alive. -- 2 corinthians 3:6
.
Now if the dispensation of death engraved in letters on stone [the ministration of the Law], was inaugurated with such glory and splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its brilliance, [a glory] that was to fade and pass away, -- 2 corinthians 3:7
.
Why should not the dispensation of the Spirit [this spiritual ministry whose task it is to cause men to obtain and be governed by the Holy Spirit] be attended with much greater and more splendid glory? -- 2 corinthians 3:8
.
For if the service that condemns [the ministration of doom] had glory, how infinitely more abounding in splendor and glory must be the service that makes righteous [the ministry that produces and fosters righteous living and right standing with God]! -- 2 corinthians 3:9
.
Indeed, in view of this fact, what once had splendor [the glory of the Law in the face of Moses] has come to have no splendor at all, because of the overwhelming glory that exceeds and excels it [the glory of the Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ]. -- 2 corinthians 3:10
.
For if that which was but passing and fading away came with splendor, how much more must that which remains and is permanent abide in glory and splendor! -- 2 corinthians 3:11
.
Since we have such [glorious] hope (such joyful and confident expectation), we speak very freely and openly and fearlessly. -- 2 corinthians 3:12
.
Nor [do we act] like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze upon the finish of the vanishing [splendor which had been upon it]. -- 2 corinthians 3:13
.
In fact, their minds were grown hard and calloused [they had become dull and had lost the power of understanding]; for until this present day, when the Old Testament (the old covenant) is being read, that same veil still lies [on their hearts], not being lifted [to reveal] that in Christ it is made void and done away. -- 2 corinthians 3:14
.
Yes, down to this [very] day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their minds and hearts. -- 2 corinthians 3:15
.
But whenever a person turns [in repentance] to the Lord, the veil is stripped off and taken away. -- 2 corinthians 3:16
.
Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (emancipation from bondage, freedom). -- 2 corinthians 3:17
.
And all of us, as with unveiled face, [because we] continued to behold [in the Word of God] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are constantly being transfigured into His very own image in ever increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another; [for this comes] from the Lord [Who is] the Spirit. -- 2 corinthians 3:18
.
THEREFORE, SINCE we do hold and engage in this ministry by the mercy of God [granting us favor, benefits, opportunities, and especially salvation], we do not get discouraged (spiritless and despondent with fear) or become faint with weariness and exhaustion. -- 2 corinthians 4:1
.
We have renounced disgraceful ways (secret thoughts, feelings, desires and underhandedness, the methods and arts that men hide through shame); we refuse to deal craftily (to practice trickery and cunning) or to adulterate or handle dishonestly the Word of God, but we state the truth openly (clearly and candidly). And so we commend ourselves in the sight and presence of God to every man's conscience. -- 2 corinthians 4:2
.
But even if our Gospel (the glad tidings) also be hidden (obscured and covered up with a veil that hinders the knowledge of God), it is hidden [only] to those who are perishing and obscured [only] to those who are spiritually dying and veiled [only] to those who are lost. -- 2 corinthians 4:3
.
For the god of this world has blinded the unbelievers' minds [that they should not discern the truth], preventing them from seeing the illuminating light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ (the Messiah), Who is the Image and Likeness of God. -- 2 corinthians 4:4
.
For what we preach is not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves [merely] as your servants (slaves) for Jesus' sake. -- 2 corinthians 4:5
.
For God Who said, Let light shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts so as [to beam forth] the Light for the illumination of the knowledge of the majesty and glory of God [as it is manifest in the Person and is revealed] in the face of Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- 2 corinthians 4:6
.
However, we possess this precious treasure [the divine Light of the Gospel] in [frail, human] vessels of earth, that the grandeur and exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from God and not from ourselves. -- 2 corinthians 4:7
.
We are hedged in (pressed) on every side [troubled and oppressed in every way], but not cramped or crushed; we suffer embarrassments and are perplexed and unable to find a way out, but not driven to despair; -- 2 corinthians 4:8
.
We are pursued (persecuted and hard driven), but not deserted [to stand alone]; we are struck down to the ground, but never struck out and destroyed; -- 2 corinthians 4:9
.
Always carrying about in the body the liability and exposure to the same putting to death that the Lord Jesus suffered, so that the [resurrection] life of Jesus also may be shown forth by and in our bodies. -- 2 corinthians 4:10
.
For we who live are constantly [experiencing] being handed over to death for Jesus' sake, that the [resurrection] life of Jesus also may be evidenced through our flesh which is liable to death. -- 2 corinthians 4:11
.
Thus death is actively at work in us, but [it is in order that our] life [may be actively at work] in you. -- 2 corinthians 4:12
.
Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, I have believed, and therefore have I spoken. We too believe, and therefore we speak, -- 2 corinthians 4:13
.
Assured that He Who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and bring us [along] with you into His presence. -- 2 corinthians 4:14
.
For all [these] things are [taking place] for your sake, so that the more grace (divine favor and spiritual blessing) extends to more and more people and multiplies through the many, the more thanksgiving may increase [and redound] to the glory of God. -- 2 corinthians 4:15
.
Therefore we do not become discouraged (utterly spiritless, exhausted, and wearied out through fear). Though our outer man is [progressively] decaying and wasting away, yet our inner self is being [progressively] renewed day after day. -- 2 corinthians 4:16
.
For our light, momentary affliction (this slight distress of the passing hour) is ever more and more abundantly preparing and producing and achieving for us an everlasting weight of glory [beyond all measure, excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations, a vast and transcendent glory and blessedness never to cease!], -- 2 corinthians 4:17
.
Since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are visible are temporal (brief and fleeting), but the things that are invisible are deathless and everlasting. -- 2 corinthians 4:18
.
FOR WE know that if the tent which is our earthly home is destroyed (dissolved), we have from God a building, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. -- 2 corinthians 5:1
.
Here indeed, in this [present abode, body], we sigh and groan inwardly, because we yearn to be clothed over [we yearn to put on our celestial body like a garment, to be fitted out] with our heavenly dwelling, -- 2 corinthians 5:2
.
So that by putting it on we may not be found naked (without a body). -- 2 corinthians 5:3
.
For while we are still in this tent, we groan under the burden and sigh deeply (weighed down, depressed, oppressed)--not that we want to put off the body (the clothing of the spirit), but rather that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal (our dying body) may be swallowed up by life [after the resurrection]. -- 2 corinthians 5:4
.
Now He Who has fashioned us [preparing and making us fit] for this very thing is God, Who also has given us the [Holy] Spirit as a guarantee [of the fulfillment of His promise]. -- 2 corinthians 5:5
.
So then, we are always full of good and hopeful and confident courage; we know that while we are at home in the body, we are abroad from the home with the Lord [that is promised us]. -- 2 corinthians 5:6
.
For we walk by faith [we regulate our lives and conduct ourselves by our conviction or belief respecting man's relationship to God and divine things, with trust and holy fervor; thus we walk] not by sight or appearance. -- 2 corinthians 5:7
.
[Yes] we have confident and hopeful courage and are pleased rather to be away from home out of the body and be at home with the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 5:8
.
Therefore, whether we are at home [on earth away from Him] or away from home [and with Him], we are constantly ambitious and strive earnestly to be pleasing to Him. -- 2 corinthians 5:9
.
For we must all appear and be revealed as we are before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive [his pay] according to what he has done in the body, whether good or evil [considering what his purpose and motive have been, and what he has achieved, been busy with, and given himself and his attention to accomplishing]. -- 2 corinthians 5:10
.
Therefore, being conscious of fearing the Lord with respect and reverence, we seek to win people over [to persuade them]. But what sort of persons we are is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood by God, and I hope that it is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood also by your consciences (your inborn discernment). -- 2 corinthians 5:11
.
We are not commending ourselves to you again, but we are providing you with an occasion and incentive to be [rightfully] proud of us, so that you may have a reply for those who pride themselves on surface appearances [on the virtues they only appear to have], although their heart is devoid of them. -- 2 corinthians 5:12
.
For if we are beside ourselves [mad, as some say], it is for God and concerns Him; if we are in our right mind, it is for your benefit, -- 2 corinthians 5:13
.
For the love of Christ controls and urges and impels us, because we are of the opinion and conviction that [if] One died for all, then all died; -- 2 corinthians 5:14
.
And He died for all, so that all those who live might live no longer to and for themselves, but to and for Him Who died and was raised again for their sake. -- 2 corinthians 5:15
.
Consequently, from now on we estimate and regard no one from a [purely] human point of view [in terms of natural standards of value]. [No] even though we once did estimate Christ from a human viewpoint and as a man, yet now [we have such knowledge of Him that] we know Him no longer [in terms of the flesh]. -- 2 corinthians 5:16
.
Therefore if any person is [ingrafted] in Christ (the Messiah) he is a new creation (a new creature altogether); the old [previous moral and spiritual condition] has passed away. Behold, the fresh and new has come! -- 2 corinthians 5:17
.
But all things are from God, Who through Jesus Christ reconciled us to Himself [received us into favor, brought us into harmony with Himself] and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation [that by word and deed we might aim to bring others into harmony with Him]. -- 2 corinthians 5:18
.
It was God [personally present] in Christ, reconciling and restoring the world to favor with Himself, not counting up and holding against [men] their trespasses [but cancelling them], and committing to us the message of reconciliation (of the restoration to favor). -- 2 corinthians 5:19
.
So we are Christ's ambassadors, God making His appeal as it were through us. We [as Christ's personal representatives] beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [now offered you] and be reconciled to God. -- 2 corinthians 5:20
.
For our sake He made Christ [virtually] to be sin Who knew no sin, so that in and through Him we might become [endued with, viewed as being in, and examples of] the righteousness of God [what we ought to be, approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him, by His goodness]. -- 2 corinthians 5:21
.
LABORING TOGETHER [as God's fellow workers] with Him then, we beg of you not to receive the grace of God in vain [that merciful kindness by which God exerts His holy influence on souls and turns them to Christ, keeping and strengthening them--do not receive it to no purpose]. -- 2 corinthians 6:1
.
For He says, In the time of favor (of an assured welcome) I have listened to and heeded your call, and I have helped you on the day of deliverance (the day of salvation). Behold, now is truly the time for a gracious welcome and acceptance [of you from God]; behold, now is the day of salvation! -- 2 corinthians 6:2
.
We put no obstruction in anybody's way [we give no offense in anything], so that no fault may be found and [our] ministry blamed and discredited. -- 2 corinthians 6:3
.
But we commend ourselves in every way as [true] servants of God: through great endurance, in tribulation and suffering, in hardships and privations, in sore straits and calamities, -- 2 corinthians 6:4
.
In beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless watching, hunger; -- 2 corinthians 6:5
.
By innocence and purity, knowledge and spiritual insight, longsuffering and patience, kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love; -- 2 corinthians 6:6
.
By [speaking] the word of truth, in the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [to attack] and for the left hand [to defend]; -- 2 corinthians 6:7
.
Amid honor and dishonor; in defaming and evil report and in praise and good report. [We are branded] as deceivers (impostors), and [yet vindicated as] truthful and honest. -- 2 corinthians 6:8
.
[We are treated] as unknown and ignored [by the world], and [yet we are] well-known and recognized [by God and His people]; as dying, and yet here we are alive; as chastened by suffering and [yet] not killed; -- 2 corinthians 6:9
.
As grieved and mourning, yet [we are] always rejoicing; as poor [ourselves, yet] bestowing riches on many; as having nothing, and [yet in reality] possessing all things. -- 2 corinthians 6:10
.
Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians [we are hiding nothing, keeping nothing back], and our heart is expanded wide [for you]! -- 2 corinthians 6:11
.
There is no lack of room for you in [our hearts], but you lack room in your own affections [for us]. -- 2 corinthians 6:12
.
By way of return then, do this for me--I speak as to children--open wide your hearts also [to us]. -- 2 corinthians 6:13
.
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers [do not make mismated alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them, inconsistent with your faith]. For what partnership have right living and right standing with God with iniquity and lawlessness? Or how can light have fellowship with darkness? -- 2 corinthians 6:14
.
What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial [the devil]? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? -- 2 corinthians 6:15
.
What agreement [can there be between] a temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in and with and among them and will walk in and with and among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. -- 2 corinthians 6:16
.
So, come out from among [unbelievers], and separate (sever) yourselves from them, says the Lord, and touch not [any] unclean thing; then I will receive you kindly and treat you with favor, -- 2 corinthians 6:17
.
And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty. -- 2 corinthians 6:18
.
THEREFORE, SINCE these [great] promises are ours, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates and defiles body and spirit, and bring [our] consecration to completeness in the [reverential] fear of God. -- 2 corinthians 7:1
.
Do open your hearts to us again [enlarge them to take us in]. We have wronged no one, we have betrayed or corrupted no one, we have cheated or taken advantage of no one. -- 2 corinthians 7:2
.
I do not say this to reproach or condemn [you], for I have said before that you are [nested] in our hearts, [and you will remain there] together [with us], whether we die or live. -- 2 corinthians 7:3
.
I have great boldness and free and fearless confidence and cheerful courage toward you; my pride in you is great. I am filled [brimful] with the comfort [of it]; with all our tribulation and in spite of it, [I am filled with comfort] I am overflowing with joy. -- 2 corinthians 7:4
.
For even when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies had no ease or rest, but we were oppressed in every way and afflicted at every turn--fighting and contentions without, dread and fears within [us]. -- 2 corinthians 7:5
.
But God, Who comforts and encourages and refreshes and cheers the depressed and the sinking, comforted and encouraged and refreshed and cheered us by the arrival of Titus. -- 2 corinthians 7:6
.
[Yes] and not only by his coming but also by [his account of] the comfort with which he was encouraged and refreshed and cheered as to you, while he told us of your yearning affection, of how sorry you were [for me] and how eagerly you took my part, so that I rejoiced still more. -- 2 corinthians 7:7
.
For even though I did grieve you with my letter, I do not regret [it now], though I did regret it; for I see that that letter did pain you, though only for a little while; -- 2 corinthians 7:8
.
Yet I am glad now, not because you were pained, but because you were pained into repentance [and so turned back to God]; for you felt a grief such as God meant you to feel, so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us or harm for what we did. -- 2 corinthians 7:9
.
For godly grief and the pain God is permitted to direct, produce a repentance that leads and contributes to salvation and deliverance from evil, and it never brings regret; but worldly grief (the hopeless sorrow that is characteristic of the pagan world) is deadly [breeding and ending in death]. -- 2 corinthians 7:10
.
For [you can look back now and] observe what this same godly sorrow has done for you and has produced in you: what eagerness and earnest care to explain and clear yourselves [of all complicity in the condoning of incest], what indignation [at the sin], what alarm, what yearning, what zeal [to do justice to all concerned], what readiness to mete out punishment [to the offender]! At every point you have proved yourselves cleared and guiltless in the matter. [I Cor. 5.] -- 2 corinthians 7:11
.
So although I did write to you [as I did], it was not for the sake and because of the one who did [the] wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered [the] wrong, but in order that you might realize before God [that your readiness to accept our authority revealed] how zealously you do care for us. -- 2 corinthians 7:12
.
Therefore we are relieved and comforted and encouraged [at the result]. And in addition to our own [personal] consolation, we were especially delighted at the joy of Titus, because you have all set his mind at rest, soothing and refreshing his spirit. -- 2 corinthians 7:13
.
For if I had boasted to him at all concerning you, I was not disappointed or put to shame, but just as everything we ever said to you was true, so our boasting [about you] to Titus has proved true also. -- 2 corinthians 7:14
.
And his heart goes out to you more abundantly than ever as he recalls the submission [to his guidance] that all of you had, and the reverence and anxiety [to meet all requirements] with which you accepted and welcomed him. -- 2 corinthians 7:15
.
I am very happy because I now am of good courage and have perfect confidence in you in all things. -- 2 corinthians 7:16
.
WE WANT to tell you further, brethren, about the grace (the favor and spiritual blessing) of God which has been evident in the churches of Macedonia [arousing in them the desire to give alms]; -- 2 corinthians 8:1
.
For in the midst of an ordeal of severe tribulation, their abundance of joy and their depth of poverty [together] have overflowed in wealth of lavish generosity on their part. -- 2 corinthians 8:2
.
For, as I can bear witness, [they gave] according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability; and [they did it] voluntarily, -- 2 corinthians 8:3
.
Begging us most insistently for the favor and the fellowship of contributing in this ministration for [the relief and support of] the saints [in Jerusalem]. -- 2 corinthians 8:4
.
Nor [was this gift of theirs merely the contribution] that we expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us [as His agents] by the will of God [entirely disregarding their personal interests, they gave as much as they possibly could, having put themselves at our disposal to be directed by the will of God]-- -- 2 corinthians 8:5
.
So much so that we have urged Titus that as he began it, he should also complete this beneficent and gracious contribution among you [the church at Corinth]. -- 2 corinthians 8:6
.
Now as you abound and excel and are at the front in everything--in faith, in expressing yourselves, in knowledge, in all zeal, and in your love for us--[see to it that you come to the front now and] abound and excel in this gracious work [of almsgiving] also. -- 2 corinthians 8:7
.
I give this not as an order [to dictate to you], but to prove, by [pointing out] the zeal of others, the sincerity of your [own] love also. -- 2 corinthians 8:8
.
For you are becoming progressively acquainted with and recognizing more strongly and clearly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (His kindness, His gracious generosity, His undeserved favor and spiritual blessing), [in] that though He was [so very] rich, yet for your sakes He became [so very] poor, in order that by His poverty you might become enriched (abundantly supplied). -- 2 corinthians 8:9
.
[It is then] my counsel and my opinion in this matter that I give [you when I say]: It is profitable and fitting for you [now to complete the enterprise] which more than a year ago you not only began, but were the first to wish to do anything [about contributions for the relief of the saints at Jerusalem]. -- 2 corinthians 8:10
.
So now finish doing it, that your [enthusiastic] readiness in desiring it may be equalled by your completion of it according to your ability and means. -- 2 corinthians 8:11
.
For if the [eager] readiness to give is there, then it is acceptable and welcomed in proportion to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. -- 2 corinthians 8:12
.
For it is not [intended] that other people be eased and relieved [of their responsibility] and you be burdened and suffer [unfairly], -- 2 corinthians 8:13
.
But to have equality [share and share alike], your surplus over necessity at the present time going to meet their want and to equalize the difference created by it, so that [at some other time] their surplus in turn may be given to supply your want. Thus there may be equality, -- 2 corinthians 8:14
.
As it is written, He who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little did not lack. -- 2 corinthians 8:15
.
But thanks be to God Who planted the same earnest zeal and care for you in the heart of Titus. -- 2 corinthians 8:16
.
For he not only welcomed and responded to our appeal, but was himself so keen in his enthusiasm and interest in you that he is going to you of his own accord. -- 2 corinthians 8:17
.
But we are sending along with him that brother [Luke?] whose praise in the Gospel ministry [is spread] throughout all the churches; -- 2 corinthians 8:18
.
And more than that, he has been appointed by the churches to travel as our companion in regard to this bountiful contribution which we are administering for the glory of the Lord Himself and [to show] our eager readiness [as Christians to help one another]. -- 2 corinthians 8:19
.
[For] we are on our guard, intending that no one should find anything for which to blame us in regard to our administration of this large contribution. -- 2 corinthians 8:20
.
For we take thought beforehand and aim to be honest and absolutely above suspicion, not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men. -- 2 corinthians 8:21
.
Moreover, along with them we are sending our brother, whom we have often put to the test and have found him zealous (devoted and earnest) in many matters, but who is now more [eagerly] earnest than ever because of [his] absolute confidence in you. -- 2 corinthians 8:22
.
As for Titus, he is my colleague and shares my work in your service; and as for the [other two] brethren, they are the [special] messengers of the churches, a credit and glory to Christ (the Messiah). -- 2 corinthians 8:23
.
Show to these men, therefore, in the sight of the churches, the reality and plain truth of your love (your affection, goodwill, and benevolence) and what [good reasons] I had for boasting about and being proud of you. -- 2 corinthians 8:24
.
NOW ABOUT the offering that is [to be made] for the saints (God's people in Jerusalem), it is quite superfluous that I should write you; -- 2 corinthians 9:1
.
For I am well acquainted with your willingness (your readiness and your eagerness to promote it) and I have proudly told about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia (most of Greece) has been prepared since last year for this contribution; and [consequently] your enthusiasm has stimulated the majority of them. -- 2 corinthians 9:2
.
Still, I am sending the brethren [on to you], lest our pride in you should be made an empty boast in this particular case, and so that you may be all ready, as I told them you would be; -- 2 corinthians 9:3
.
Lest, if [any] Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared [for this generosity], we, to say nothing of yourselves, be humiliated for our being so confident. -- 2 corinthians 9:4
.
That is why I thought it necessary to urge these brethren to go to you before I do and make arrangements in advance for this bountiful, promised gift of yours, so that it may be ready, not as an extortion [wrung out of you] but as a generous and willing gift. -- 2 corinthians 9:5
.
[Remember] this: he who sows sparingly and grudgingly will also reap sparingly and grudgingly, and he who sows generously [that blessings may come to someone] will also reap generously and with blessings. -- 2 corinthians 9:6
.
Let each one [give] as he has made up his own mind and purposed in his heart, not reluctantly or sorrowfully or under compulsion, for God loves (He takes pleasure in, prizes above other things, and is unwilling to abandon or to do without) a cheerful (joyous, "prompt to do it") giver [whose heart is in his giving]. -- 2 corinthians 9:7
.
And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation]. -- 2 corinthians 9:8
.
As it is written, He [the benevolent person] scatters abroad; He gives to the poor; His deeds of justice and goodness and kindness and benevolence will go on and endure forever! -- 2 corinthians 9:9
.
And [God] Who provides seed for the sower and bread for eating will also provide and multiply your [resources for] sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness [which manifests itself in active goodness, kindness, and charity]. -- 2 corinthians 9:10
.
Thus you will be enriched in all things and in every way, so that you can be generous, and [your generosity as it is] administered by us will bring forth thanksgiving to God. -- 2 corinthians 9:11
.
For the service that the ministering of this fund renders does not only fully supply what is lacking to the saints (God's people), but it also overflows in many [cries of] thanksgiving to God. -- 2 corinthians 9:12
.
Because at [your] standing of the test of this ministry, they will glorify God for your loyalty and obedience to the Gospel of Christ which you confess, as well as for your generous-hearted liberality to them and to all [the other needy ones]. -- 2 corinthians 9:13
.
And they yearn for you while they pray for you, because of the surpassing measure of God's grace (His favor and mercy and spiritual blessing which is shown forth) in you. -- 2 corinthians 9:14
.
Now thanks be to God for His Gift, [precious] beyond telling [His indescribable, inexpressible, free Gift]! -- 2 corinthians 9:15
.
NOW I myself, Paul, beseech you, by the gentleness and consideration of Christ [Himself; I] who [am] lowly enough [so they say] when among you face to face, but bold (fearless and outspoken) to you when [I am] absent from you! -- 2 corinthians 10:1
.
I entreat you when I do come [to you] that I may not [be driven to such] boldness as I intend to show toward those few who suspect us of acting according to the flesh [on the low level of worldly motives and as if invested with only human powers]. -- 2 corinthians 10:2
.
For though we walk (live) in the flesh, we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons. -- 2 corinthians 10:3
.
For the weapons of our warfare are not physical [weapons of flesh and blood], but they are mighty before God for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds, -- 2 corinthians 10:4
.
[Inasmuch as we] refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the [true] knowledge of God; and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One), -- 2 corinthians 10:5
.
Being in readiness to punish every [insubordinate for his] disobedience, when your own submission and obedience [as a church] are fully secured and complete. -- 2 corinthians 10:6
.
Look at [this obvious fact] which is before your eyes. If anyone is confident that he is Christ's, let him reflect and remind himself that even as he is Christ's, so too are we. -- 2 corinthians 10:7
.
For even though I boast rather freely about our power and authority, which the Lord gave for your upbuilding and not for demolishing you, yet I shall not be put to shame [for exceeding the truth], -- 2 corinthians 10:8
.
Neither would I seem to be overawing or frightening you with my letters; -- 2 corinthians 10:9
.
For they say, His letters are weighty and impressive and forceful and telling, but his personality and bodily presence are weak, and his speech and delivery are utterly contemptible (of no account). -- 2 corinthians 10:10
.
Let such people realize that what we say by letters when we are absent, [we put] also into deeds when we are present-- -- 2 corinthians 10:11
.
Not that we [have the audacity to] venture to class or [even to] compare ourselves with some who exalt and furnish testimonials for themselves! However, when they measure themselves with themselves and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding and behave unwisely. -- 2 corinthians 10:12
.
We, on the other hand, will not boast beyond our legitimate province and proper limit, but will keep within the limits [of our commission which] God has allotted us as our measuring line and which reaches and includes even you. -- 2 corinthians 10:13
.
For we are not overstepping the limits of our province and stretching beyond our ability to reach, as though we reached not (had no legitimate mission) to you, for we were [the very first] to come even as far as to you with the good news (the Gospel) of Christ. -- 2 corinthians 10:14
.
We do not boast therefore, beyond our proper limit, over other men's labors, but we have the hope and confident expectation that as your faith continues to grow, our field among you may be greatly enlarged, still within the limits of our commission, -- 2 corinthians 10:15
.
So that [we may even] preach the Gospel in lands [lying] beyond you, without making a boast of work already done in another [man's] sphere of activity [before we came on the scene]. -- 2 corinthians 10:16
.
However, let him who boasts and glories boast and glory in the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 10:17
.
For [it is] not [the man] who praises and commends himself who is approved and accepted, but [it is the person] whom the Lord accredits and commends. -- 2 corinthians 10:18
.
I WISH you would bear with me while I indulge in a little [so-called] foolishness. Do bear with me! -- 2 corinthians 11:1
.
For I am zealous for you with a godly eagerness and a divine jealousy, for I have betrothed you to one Husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. -- 2 corinthians 11:2
.
But [now] I am fearful, lest that even as the serpent beguiled Eve by his cunning, so your minds may be corrupted and seduced from wholehearted and sincere and pure devotion to Christ. -- 2 corinthians 11:3
.
For [you seem readily to endure it] if a man comes and preaches another Jesus than the One we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the [Spirit] you [once] received or a different gospel from the one you [then] received and welcomed; you tolerate [all that] well enough! -- 2 corinthians 11:4
.
Yet I consider myself as in no way inferior to these [precious] extra-super [false] apostles. -- 2 corinthians 11:5
.
But even if [I am] unskilled in speaking, yet [I am] not [unskilled] in knowledge [I know what I am talking about]; we have made this evident to you in all things. -- 2 corinthians 11:6
.
But did I perhaps make a mistake and do you a wrong in debasing and cheapening myself so that you might be exalted and enriched in dignity and honor and happiness by preaching God's Gospel without expense to you? -- 2 corinthians 11:7
.
Other churches I have robbed by accepting [more than their share of] support for my ministry [from them in order] to serve you. -- 2 corinthians 11:8
.
And when I was with you and ran short financially, I did not burden any [of you], for what I lacked was abundantly made up by the brethren who came from Macedonia. So I kept myself from being burdensome to you in any way, and will continue to keep [myself from being so]. -- 2 corinthians 11:9
.
As the truth of Christ is in me, this my boast [of independence] shall not be debarred (silenced or checked) in the regions of Achaia (most of Greece). -- 2 corinthians 11:10
.
And why? Because I do not love you [do not have a preference for you, wish you well, and regard your welfare]? God perceives and knows that I do! -- 2 corinthians 11:11
.
But what I do, I will continue to do, [for I am determined to maintain this independence] in order to cut off the claim of those who would like [to find an occasion and incentive] to claim that in their boasted [mission] they work on the same terms that we do. -- 2 corinthians 11:12
.
For such men are false apostles [spurious, counterfeits], deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles (special messengers) of Christ (the Messiah). -- 2 corinthians 11:13
.
And it is no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light; -- 2 corinthians 11:14
.
So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as ministers of righteousness. [But] their end will correspond with their deeds. -- 2 corinthians 11:15
.
I repeat then, let no one think I have lost my wits; but even if you do, then bear with a witless man, so that I too may boast a little. -- 2 corinthians 11:16
.
What I say by way of this confident boasting, I say not with the Lord's authority [by inspiration] but, as it were, in pure witlessness. -- 2 corinthians 11:17
.
[For] since many boast of worldly things and according to the flesh, I will glory (boast) also. -- 2 corinthians 11:18
.
For you readily and gladly bear with the foolish, since you are so smart and wise yourselves! -- 2 corinthians 11:19
.
For you endure it if a man assumes control of your souls and makes slaves of you, or devours [your substance, spends your money] and preys upon you, or deceives and takes advantage of you, or is arrogant and puts on airs, or strikes you in the face. -- 2 corinthians 11:20
.
To my discredit, I must say, we have shown ourselves too weak [for you to show such tolerance of us and for us to do strong, courageous things like that to you]! But in whatever any person is bold and dares [to boast]--mind you, I am speaking in this foolish (witless) way--I also am bold and dare [to boast]. -- 2 corinthians 11:21
.
They are Hebrews? So am I! They are Israelites? So am I! They are descendants of Abraham? So am I! -- 2 corinthians 11:22
.
Are they [ministering] servants of Christ (the Messiah)? I am talking like one beside himself, [but] I am more, with far more extensive and abundant labors, with far more imprisonments, [beaten] with countless stripes, and frequently [at the point of] death. -- 2 corinthians 11:23
.
Five times I received from [the hands of] the Jews forty [lashes all] but one; -- 2 corinthians 11:24
.
Three times I have been beaten with rods; once I was stoned. Three times I have been aboard a ship wrecked at sea; a [whole] night and a day I have spent [adrift] on the deep; -- 2 corinthians 11:25
.
Many times on journeys, [exposed to] perils from rivers, perils from bandits, perils from [my own] nation, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the desert places, perils in the sea, perils from those posing as believers [but destitute of Christian knowledge and piety]; -- 2 corinthians 11:26
.
In toil and hardship, watching often [through sleepless nights], in hunger and thirst, frequently driven to fasting by want, in cold and exposure and lack of clothing. -- 2 corinthians 11:27
.
And besides those things that are without, there is the daily [inescapable pressure] of my care and anxiety for all the churches! -- 2 corinthians 11:28
.
Who is weak, and I do not feel [his] weakness? Who is made to stumble and fall and have his faith hurt, and I am not on fire [with sorrow or indignation]? -- 2 corinthians 11:29
.
If I must boast, I will boast of the things that [show] my infirmity [of the things by which I am made weak and contemptible in the eyes of my opponents]. -- 2 corinthians 11:30
.
The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ knows, He Who is blessed and to be praised forevermore, that I do not lie. -- 2 corinthians 11:31
.
In Damascus, the city governor acting under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus [on purpose] to arrest me, -- 2 corinthians 11:32
.
And I was [actually] let down in a [rope] basket or hamper through a window (a small door) in the wall, and I escaped through his fingers. -- 2 corinthians 11:33
.
TRUE, THERE is nothing to be gained by it, but [as I am obliged] to boast, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 12:1
.
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows--was caught up to the third heaven. -- 2 corinthians 12:2
.
And I know that this man--whether in the body or away from the body I do not know, God knows-- -- 2 corinthians 12:3
.
Was caught up into paradise, and he heard utterances beyond the power of man to put into words, which man is not permitted to utter. -- 2 corinthians 12:4
.
Of this same [man's experiences] I will boast, but of myself (personally) I will not boast, except as regards my infirmities (my weaknesses). -- 2 corinthians 12:5
.
Should I desire to boast, I shall not be a witless braggart, for I shall be speaking the truth. But I abstain [from it] so that no one may form a higher estimate of me than [is justified by] what he sees in me or hears from me. -- 2 corinthians 12:6
.
And to keep me from being puffed up and too much elated by the exceeding greatness (preeminence) of these revelations, there was given me a thorn (a splinter) in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to rack and buffet and harass me, to keep me from being excessively exalted. [Job. 2:6.] -- 2 corinthians 12:7
.
Three times I called upon the Lord and besought [Him] about this and begged that it might depart from me; -- 2 corinthians 12:8
.
But He said to me, My grace (My favor and loving-kindness and mercy) is enough for you [sufficient against any danger and enables you to bear the trouble manfully]; for My strength and power are made perfect (fulfilled and completed) and show themselves most effective in [your] weakness. Therefore, I will all the more gladly glory in my weaknesses and infirmities, that the strength and power of Christ (the Messiah) may rest (yes, may pitch a tent over and dwell) upon me! -- 2 corinthians 12:9
.
So for the sake of Christ, I am well pleased and take pleasure in infirmities, insults, hardships, persecutions, perplexities and distresses; for when I am weak [in human strength], then am I [truly] strong (able, powerful in divine strength). -- 2 corinthians 12:10
.
Now I have been [speaking like] a fool! But you forced me to it, for I ought to have been [saved the necessity and] commended by you. For I have not fallen short one bit or proved myself at all inferior to those superlative [false] apostles [of yours], even if I am nothing (a nobody). -- 2 corinthians 12:11
.
Indeed, the signs that indicate a [genuine] apostle were performed among you fully and most patiently in miracles and wonders and mighty works. -- 2 corinthians 12:12
.
For in what respect were you put to a disadvantage in comparison with the rest of the churches, unless [it was for the fact] that I myself did not burden you [with my financial support]? Pardon me [for doing you] this injustice! -- 2 corinthians 12:13
.
Now for the third time I am ready to come to [visit] you. And I will not burden you [financially], for it is not your [money] that I want but you; for children are not duty bound to lay up store for their parents, but parents for their children. -- 2 corinthians 12:14
.
But I will most gladly spend [myself] and be utterly spent for your souls. If I love you exceedingly, am I to be loved [by you] the less? -- 2 corinthians 12:15
.
But though granting that I did not burden you [with my support, some say that] I was crafty [and that] I cheated and got the better of you with my trickery. -- 2 corinthians 12:16
.
Did I [then] take advantage of you or make any money out of you through any of those [messengers] whom I sent to you? -- 2 corinthians 12:17
.
[Actually] I urged Titus [to go], and I sent the brother with [him]. Did Titus overreach or take advantage of you [in anything]? Did he and I not act in the same spirit? Did we not [take the] same steps? -- 2 corinthians 12:18
.
Have you been supposing [all this time] that we have been defending ourselves and apologizing to you? [It is] in the sight and the [very] presence of God [and as one] in Christ (the Messiah) that we have been speaking, dearly beloved, and all in order to build you up [spiritually]. -- 2 corinthians 12:19
.
For I am fearful that somehow or other I may come and find you not as I desire to find you, and that you may find me too not as you want to find me--that perhaps there may be factions (quarreling), jealousy, temper (wrath, intrigues, rivalry, divided loyalties), selfishness, whispering, gossip, arrogance (self-assertion), and disorder among you. -- 2 corinthians 12:20
.
[I am fearful] that when I come again, my God may humiliate and humble me in your regard, and that I may have to sorrow over many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity, sexual vice, and sensuality which they formerly practiced. -- 2 corinthians 12:21
.
THIS IS the third time that I am coming to you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses must any charge and every accusing statement be sustained and confirmed. -- 2 corinthians 13:1
.
I have already warned those who sinned formerly and all the rest also, and I warn them now again while I am absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come back, I will not spare [them], -- 2 corinthians 13:2
.
Since you desire and seek [perceptible] proof of the Christ Who speaks in and through me. [For He] is not weak and feeble in dealing with you, but is a mighty power within you; -- 2 corinthians 13:3
.
For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He goes on living by the power of God. And though we too are weak in Him [as He was humanly weak], yet in dealing with you [we shall show ourselves] alive and strong in [fellowship with] Him by the power of God. -- 2 corinthians 13:4
.
Examine and test and evaluate your own selves to see whether you are holding to your faith and showing the proper fruits of it. Test and prove yourselves [not Christ]. Do you not yourselves realize and know [thoroughly by an ever-increasing experience] that Jesus Christ is in you--unless you are [counterfeits] disapproved on trial and rejected? -- 2 corinthians 13:5
.
But I hope you will recognize and know that we are not disapproved on trial and rejected. -- 2 corinthians 13:6
.
But I pray to God that you may do nothing wrong, not in order that we [our teaching] may appear to be approved, but that you may continue doing right, [though] we may seem to have failed and be unapproved. -- 2 corinthians 13:7
.
For we can do nothing against the Truth [not serve any party or personal interest], but only for the Truth [which is the Gospel]. -- 2 corinthians 13:8
.
For we are glad when we are weak (unapproved) and you are really strong. And this we also pray for: your all-round strengthening and perfecting of soul. -- 2 corinthians 13:9
.
So I write these things while I am absent from you, that when I come to you, I may not have to deal sharply in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me [to be employed, however] for building [you] up and not for tearing [you] down. -- 2 corinthians 13:10
.
Finally, brethren, farewell (rejoice)! Be strengthened (perfected, completed, made what you ought to be); be encouraged and consoled and comforted; be of the same [agreeable] mind one with another; live in peace, and [then] the God of love [Who is the Source of affection, goodwill, love, and benevolence toward men] and the Author and Promoter of peace will be with you. -- 2 corinthians 13:11
.
Greet one another with a consecrated kiss. -- 2 corinthians 13:12
.
All the saints (the people of God here) salute you. -- 2 corinthians 13:13
.
The grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the presence and fellowship (the communion and sharing together, and participation) in the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen (so be it). -- 2 corinthians 13:14
.
PAUL, AN apostle--[special messenger appointed and commissioned and sent out] not from [any body of] men nor by or through any man, but by and through Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and God the Father, Who raised Him from among the dead-- -- galatians 1:1
.
And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia: -- galatians 1:2
.
Grace and spiritual blessing be to you and [soul] peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah), -- galatians 1:3
.
Who gave (yielded) Himself up [to atone] for our sins [and to save and sanctify us], in order to rescue and deliver us from this present wicked age and world order, in accordance with the will and purpose and plan of our God and Father-- -- galatians 1:4
.
To Him [be ascribed all] the glory through all the ages of the ages and the eternities of the eternities! Amen (so be it). -- galatians 1:5
.
I am surprised and astonished that you are so quickly turning renegade and deserting Him Who invited and called you by the grace (unmerited favor) of Christ (the Messiah) [and that you are transferring your allegiance] to a different [even an opposition] gospel. -- galatians 1:6
.
Not that there is [or could be] any other [genuine Gospel], but there are [obviously] some who are troubling and disturbing and bewildering you [with a different kind of teaching which they offer as a gospel] and want to pervert and distort the Gospel of Christ (the Messiah) [into something which it absolutely is not]. -- galatians 1:7
.
But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to and different from that which we preached to you, let him be accursed (anathema, devoted to destruction, doomed to eternal punishment)! -- galatians 1:8
.
As we said before, so I now say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel different from or contrary to that which you received [from us], let him be accursed (anathema, devoted to destruction, doomed to eternal punishment)! -- galatians 1:9
.
Now am I trying to win the favor of men, or of God? Do I seek to please men? If I were still seeking popularity with men, I should not be a bond servant of Christ (the Messiah). -- galatians 1:10
.
For I want you to know, brethren, that the Gospel which was proclaimed and made known by me is not man's gospel [a human invention, according to or patterned after any human standard]. -- galatians 1:11
.
For indeed I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through a [direct] revelation [given] by Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- galatians 1:12
.
You have heard of my earlier career and former manner of life in the Jewish religion (Judaism), how I persecuted and abused the church of God furiously and extensively, and [with fanatical zeal did my best] to make havoc of it and destroy it. -- galatians 1:13
.
And [you have heard how] I outstripped many of the men of my own generation among the people of my race in [my advancement in study and observance of the laws of] Judaism, so extremely enthusiastic and zealous I was for the traditions of my ancestors. -- galatians 1:14
.
But when He, Who had chosen and set me apart [even] before I was born and had called me by His grace (His undeserved favor and blessing), saw fit and was pleased -- galatians 1:15
.
To reveal (unveil, disclose) His Son within me so that I might proclaim Him among the Gentiles (the non-Jewish world) as the glad tidings (Gospel), immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood [did not consult or counsel with any frail human being or communicate with anyone]. -- galatians 1:16
.
Nor did I [even] go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles (special messengers of Christ) before I was, but I went away and retired into Arabia, and afterward I came back again to Damascus. -- galatians 1:17
.
Then three years later, I did go up to Jerusalem to become [personally] acquainted with Cephas (Peter), and remained with him for fifteen days. -- galatians 1:18
.
But I did not see any of the other apostles (the special messengers of Christ) except James the brother of our Lord. -- galatians 1:19
.
Now [note carefully what I am telling you, for it is the truth], I write this as if I were standing before the bar of God; I do not lie. -- galatians 1:20
.
Then I went into the districts (countries, regions) of Syria and Cilicia. -- galatians 1:21
.
And so far I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea (the country surrounding Jerusalem). -- galatians 1:22
.
They were only hearing it said, He who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the very faith he once reviled and which he set out to ruin and tried with all his might to destroy. -- galatians 1:23
.
And they glorified God [as the Author and Source of what had taken place] in me. -- galatians 1:24
.
THEN AFTER [an interval] of fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem. [This time I went] with Barnabas, taking Titus along with [me] also. -- galatians 2:1
.
I went because it was specially and divinely revealed to me that I should go, and I put before them the Gospel [declaring to them that] which I preach among the Gentiles. However, [I presented the matter] privately before those of repute, [for I wanted to make certain, by thus at first confining my communication to this private conference] that I was not running or had not run in vain [guarding against being discredited either in what I was planning to do or had already done]. -- galatians 2:2
.
But [all went well!] even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled [as some had anticipated] to be circumcised, although he was a Greek. -- galatians 2:3
.
[My precaution was] because of false brethren who had been secretly smuggled in [to the Christian brotherhood]; they had slipped in to spy on our liberty and the freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might again bring us into bondage [under the Law of Moses]. -- galatians 2:4
.
To them we did not yield submission even for a moment, that the truth of the Gospel might continue to be [preserved] for you [in its purity]. -- galatians 2:5
.
Moreover, [no new requirements were made] by those who were reputed to be something--though what was their individual position and whether they really were of importance or not makes no difference to me; God is not impressed with the positions that men hold and He is not partial and recognizes no external distinctions--those [I say] who were of repute imposed no new requirements upon me [had nothing to add to my Gospel, and from them I received no new suggestions]. -- galatians 2:6
.
But on the contrary, when they [really] saw that I had been entrusted [to carry] the Gospel to the uncircumcised [Gentiles, just as definitely] as Peter had been entrusted [to proclaim] the Gospel to the circumcised [Jews, they were agreeable]; -- galatians 2:7
.
For He Who motivated and fitted Peter and worked effectively through him for the mission to the circumcised, motivated and fitted me and worked through me also for [the mission to] the Gentiles. -- galatians 2:8
.
And when they knew (perceived, recognized, understood, and acknowledged) the grace (God's unmerited favor and spiritual blessing) that had been bestowed upon me, James and Cephas (Peter) and John, who were reputed to be pillars of the Jerusalem church, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, with the understanding that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised (Jews). -- galatians 2:9
.
They only [made one stipulation], that we were to remember the poor, which very thing I was also eager to do. -- galatians 2:10
.
But when Cephas (Peter) came to Antioch, I protested and opposed him to his face [concerning his conduct there], for he was blameable and stood condemned. -- galatians 2:11
.
For up to the time that certain persons came from James, he ate his meals with the Gentile [converts]; but when the men [from Jerusalem] arrived, he withdrew and held himself aloof from the Gentiles and [ate] separately for fear of those of the circumcision [party]. -- galatians 2:12
.
And the rest of the Jews along with him also concealed their true convictions and acted insincerely, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy (their example of insincerity and pretense). -- galatians 2:13
.
But as soon as I saw that they were not straightforward and were not living up to the truth of the Gospel, I said to Cephas (Peter) before everybody present, If you, though born a Jew, can live [as you have been living] like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how do you dare now to urge and practically force the Gentiles to [comply with the ritual of Judaism and] live like Jews? -- galatians 2:14
.
[I went on to say] Although we ourselves (you and I) are Jews by birth and not Gentile (heathen) sinners, -- galatians 2:15
.
Yet we know that a man is justified or reckoned righteous and in right standing with God not by works of the Law, but [only] through faith and [absolute] reliance on and adherence to and trust in Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). [Therefore] even we [ourselves] have believed on Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the Law [for we cannot be justified by any observance of the ritual of the Law given by Moses], because by keeping legal rituals and by works no human being can ever be justified (declared righteous and put in right standing with God). -- galatians 2:16
.
But if, in our desire and endeavor to be justified in Christ [to be declared righteous and put in right standing with God wholly and solely through Christ], we have shown ourselves sinners also and convicted of sin, does that make Christ a minister (a party and contributor) to our sin? Banish the thought! [Of course not!] -- galatians 2:17
.
For if I [or any others who have taught that the observance of the Law of Moses is not essential to being justified by God should now by word or practice teach or intimate that it is essential to] build up again what I tore down, I prove myself a transgressor. -- galatians 2:18
.
For I through the Law [under the operation of the curse of the Law] have [in Christ's death for me] myself died to the Law and all the Law's demands upon me, so that I may [henceforth] live to and for God. -- galatians 2:19
.
I have been crucified with Christ [in Him I have shared His crucifixion]; it is no longer I who live, but Christ (the Messiah) lives in me; and the life I now live in the body I live by faith in (by adherence to and reliance on and complete trust in) the Son of God, Who loved me and gave Himself up for me. -- galatians 2:20
.
[Therefore, I do not treat God's gracious gift as something of minor importance and defeat its very purpose]; I do not set aside and invalidate and frustrate and nullify the grace (unmerited favor) of God. For if justification (righteousness, acquittal from guilt) comes through [observing the ritual of] the Law, then Christ (the Messiah) died groundlessly and to no purpose and in vain. [His death was then wholly superfluous.] -- galatians 2:21
.
O YOU poor and silly and thoughtless and unreflecting and senseless Galatians! Who has fascinated or bewitched or cast a spell over you, unto whom--right before your very eyes--Jesus Christ (the Messiah) was openly and graphically set forth and portrayed as crucified? -- galatians 3:1
.
Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the [Holy] Spirit as the result of obeying the Law and doing its works, or was it by hearing [the message of the Gospel] and believing [it]? [Was it from observing a law of rituals or from a message of faith?] -- galatians 3:2
.
Are you so foolish and so senseless and so silly? Having begun [your new life spiritually] with the [Holy] Spirit, are you now reaching perfection [by dependence] on the flesh? -- galatians 3:3
.
Have you suffered so many things and experienced so much all for nothing (to no purpose)--if it really is to no purpose and in vain? -- galatians 3:4
.
Then does He Who supplies you with His marvelous [Holy] Spirit and works powerfully and miraculously among you do so on [the grounds of your doing] what the Law demands, or because of your believing in and adhering to and trusting in and relying on the message that you heard? -- galatians 3:5
.
Thus Abraham believed in and adhered to and trusted in and relied on God, and it was reckoned and placed to his account and credited as righteousness (as conformity to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action). -- galatians 3:6
.
Know and understand that it is [really] the people [who live] by faith who are [the true] sons of Abraham. -- galatians 3:7
.
And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify (declare righteous, put in right standing with Himself) the Gentiles in consequence of faith, proclaimed the Gospel [foretelling the glad tidings of a Savior long beforehand] to Abraham in the promise, saying, In you shall all the nations [of the earth] be blessed. -- galatians 3:8
.
So then, those who are people of faith are blessed and made happy and favored by God [as partners in fellowship] with the believing and trusting Abraham. -- galatians 3:9
.
And all who depend on the Law [who are seeking to be justified by obedience to the Law of rituals] are under a curse and doomed to disappointment and destruction, for it is written in the Scriptures, Cursed (accursed, devoted to destruction, doomed to eternal punishment) be everyone who does not continue to abide (live and remain) by all the precepts and commands written in the Book of the Law and to practice them. -- galatians 3:10
.
Now it is evident that no person is justified (declared righteous and brought into right standing with God) through the Law, for the Scripture says, The man in right standing with God [the just, the righteous] shall live by and out of faith and he who through and by faith is declared righteous and in right standing with God shall live. -- galatians 3:11
.
But the Law does not rest on faith [does not require faith, has nothing to do with faith], for it itself says, He who does them [the things prescribed by the Law] shall live by them [not by faith]. -- galatians 3:12
.
Christ purchased our freedom [redeeming us] from the curse (doom) of the Law [and its condemnation] by [Himself] becoming a curse for us, for it is written [in the Scriptures], Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree (is crucified); -- galatians 3:13
.
To the end that through [their receiving] Christ Jesus, the blessing [promised] to Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, so that we through faith might [all] receive [the realization of] the promise of the [Holy] Spirit. -- galatians 3:14
.
To speak in terms of human relations, brethren, [if] even a man makes a last will and testament (a merely human covenant), no one sets it aside or makes it void or adds to it when once it has been drawn up and signed (ratified, confirmed). -- galatians 3:15
.
Now the promises (covenants, agreements) were decreed and made to Abraham and his Seed (his Offspring, his Heir). He [God] does not say, And to seeds (descendants, heirs), as if referring to many persons, but, And to your Seed (your Descendant, your Heir), obviously referring to one individual, Who is [none other than] Christ (the Messiah). -- galatians 3:16
.
This is my argument: The Law, which began years after the covenant [concerning the coming Messiah], does not and cannot annul the covenant previously established (ratified) by God, so as to abolish the promise and make it void. -- galatians 3:17
.
For if the inheritance [of the promise depends on observing] the Law [as these false teachers would like you to believe], it no longer [depends] on the promise; however, God gave it to Abraham [as a free gift solely] by virtue of His promise. -- galatians 3:18
.
What then was the purpose of the Law? It was added [later on, after the promise, to disclose and expose to men their guilt] because of transgressions and [to make men more conscious of the sinfulness] of sin; and it was intended to be in effect until the Seed (the Descendant, the Heir) should come, to and concerning Whom the promise had been made. And it [the Law] was arranged and ordained and appointed through the instrumentality of angels [and was given] by the hand (in the person) of a go-between [Moses, an intermediary person between God and man]. -- galatians 3:19
.
Now a go-between (intermediary) has to do with and implies more than one party [there can be no mediator with just one person]. Yet God is [only] one Person [and He was the sole party in giving that promise to Abraham. But the Law was a contract between two, God and Israel; its validity was dependent on both]. -- galatians 3:20
.
Is the Law then contrary and opposed to the promises of God? Of course not! For if a Law had been given which could confer [spiritual] life, then righteousness and right standing with God would certainly have come by Law. -- galatians 3:21
.
But the Scriptures [picture all mankind as sinners] shut up and imprisoned by sin, so that [the inheritance, blessing] which was promised through faith in Jesus Christ (the Messiah) might be given (released, delivered, and committed) to [all] those who believe [who adhere to and trust in and rely on Him]. -- galatians 3:22
.
Now before the faith came, we were perpetually guarded under the Law, kept in custody in preparation for the faith that was destined to be revealed (unveiled, disclosed), -- galatians 3:23
.
So that the Law served [to us Jews] as our trainer [our guardian, our guide to Christ, to lead us] until Christ [came], that we might be justified (declared righteous, put in right standing with God) by and through faith. -- galatians 3:24
.
But now that the faith has come, we are no longer under a trainer (the guardian of our childhood). -- galatians 3:25
.
For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith. -- galatians 3:26
.
For as many [of you] as were baptized into Christ [into a spiritual union and communion with Christ, the Anointed One, the Messiah] have put on (clothed yourselves with) Christ. -- galatians 3:27
.
There is [now no distinction] neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. -- galatians 3:28
.
And if you belong to Christ [are in Him Who is Abraham's Seed], then you are Abraham's offspring and [spiritual] heirs according to promise. -- galatians 3:29
.
NOW WHAT I mean is that as long as the inheritor (heir) is a child and under age, he does not differ from a slave, although he is the master of all the estate; -- galatians 4:1
.
But he is under guardians and administrators or trustees until the date fixed by his father. -- galatians 4:2
.
So we [Jewish Christians] also, when we were minors, were kept like slaves under [the rules of the Hebrew ritual and subject to] the elementary teachings of a system of external observations and regulations. -- galatians 4:3
.
But when the proper time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born subject to [the regulations of] the Law, -- galatians 4:4
.
To purchase the freedom of (to ransom, to redeem, to atone for) those who were subject to the Law, that we might be adopted and have sonship conferred upon us [and be recognized as God's sons]. -- galatians 4:5
.
And because you [really] are [His] sons, God has sent the [Holy] Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba (Father)! Father! -- galatians 4:6
.
Therefore, you are no longer a slave (bond servant) but a son; and if a son, then [it follows that you are] an heir by the aid of God, through Christ. -- galatians 4:7
.
But at that previous time, when you had not come to be acquainted with and understand and know the true God, you [Gentiles] were in bondage to gods who by their very nature could not be gods at all [gods that really did not exist]. -- galatians 4:8
.
Now, however, that you have come to be acquainted with and understand and know [the true] God, or rather to be understood and known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly and worthless elementary things [of all religions before Christ came], whose slaves you once more want to become? -- galatians 4:9
.
You observe [particular] days and months and seasons and years! -- galatians 4:10
.
I am alarmed [about you], lest I have labored among and over you to no purpose and in vain. -- galatians 4:11
.
Brethren, I beg of you, become as I am [free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances], for I also have become as you are [a Gentile]. You did me no wrong [in the days when I first came to you; do not do it now]. -- galatians 4:12
.
On the contrary, you know that it was on account of a bodily ailment that [I remained and] preached the Gospel to you the first time. -- galatians 4:13
.
And [yet] although my physical condition was [such] a trial to you, you did not regard it with contempt, or scorn and loathe and reject me; but you received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus [Himself]! -- galatians 4:14
.
What has become of that blessed enjoyment and satisfaction and self-congratulation that once was yours [in what I taught you and in your regard for me]? For I bear you witness that you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me [to replace mine], if that were possible. -- galatians 4:15
.
Have I then become your enemy by telling the truth to you and dealing sincerely with you? -- galatians 4:16
.
These men [the Judaizing teachers] are zealously trying to dazzle you [paying court to you, making much of you], but their purpose is not honorable or worthy or for any good. What they want to do is to isolate you [from us who oppose them], so that they may win you over to their side and get you to court their favor. -- galatians 4:17
.
It is always a fine thing [of course] to be zealously sought after [as you are, provided that it is] for a good purpose and done by reason of purity of heart and life, and not just when I am present with you! -- galatians 4:18
.
My little children, for whom I am again suffering birth pangs until Christ is completely and permanently formed (molded) within you, -- galatians 4:19
.
Would that I were with you now and could coax you vocally, for I am fearful and perplexed about you! -- galatians 4:20
.
Tell me, you who are bent on being under the Law, will you listen to what the Law [really] says? -- galatians 4:21
.
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid and one by the free woman. -- galatians 4:22
.
But whereas the child of the slave woman was born according to the flesh and had an ordinary birth, the son of the free woman was born in fulfillment of the promise. -- galatians 4:23
.
Now all this is an allegory; these [two women] represent two covenants. One covenant originated from Mount Sinai [where the Law was given] and bears [children destined] for slavery; this is Hagar. -- galatians 4:24
.
Now Hagar is (stands for) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to and belongs in the same category with the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage together with her children. -- galatians 4:25
.
But the Jerusalem above (the Messianic kingdom of Christ) is free, and she is our mother. -- galatians 4:26
.
For it is written in the Scriptures, Rejoice, O barren woman, who has not given birth to children; break forth into a joyful shout, you who are not feeling birth pangs, for the desolate woman has many more children than she who has a husband. -- galatians 4:27
.
But we, brethren, are children [not by physical descent, as was Ishmael, but] like Isaac, born in virtue of promise. -- galatians 4:28
.
Yet [just] as at that time the child [of ordinary birth] born according to the flesh despised and persecuted him [who was born remarkably] according to [the promise and the working of] the [Holy] Spirit, so it is now also. -- galatians 4:29
.
But what does the Scripture say? Cast out and send away the slave woman and her son, for never shall the son of the slave woman be heir and share the inheritance with the son of the free woman. -- galatians 4:30
.
So, brethren, we [who are born again] are not children of a slave woman [the natural], but of the free [the supernatural]. -- galatians 4:31
.
IN [this] freedom Christ has made us free [and completely liberated us]; stand fast then, and do not be hampered and held ensnared and submit again to a yoke of slavery [which you have once put off]. -- galatians 5:1
.
Notice, it is I, Paul, who tells you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no profit (advantage, avail) to you [for if you distrust Him, you can gain nothing from Him]. -- galatians 5:2
.
I once more protest and testify to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation and bound to practice the whole of the Law and its ordinances. -- galatians 5:3
.
If you seek to be justified and declared righteous and to be given a right standing with God through the Law, you are brought to nothing and so separated (severed) from Christ. You have fallen away from grace (from God's gracious favor and unmerited blessing). -- galatians 5:4
.
For we, [not relying on the Law but] through the [Holy] Spirit's [help], by faith anticipate and wait for the blessing and good for which our righteousness and right standing with God [our conformity to His will in purpose, thought, and action, causes us] to hope. -- galatians 5:5
.
For [if we are] in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith activated and energized and expressed and working through love. -- galatians 5:6
.
You were running the race nobly. Who has interfered in (hindered and stopped you from) your heeding and following the Truth? -- galatians 5:7
.
This [evil] persuasion is not from Him Who called you [Who invited you to freedom in Christ]. -- galatians 5:8
.
A little leaven (a slight inclination to error, or a few false teachers) leavens the whole lump [it perverts the whole conception of faith or misleads the whole church]. -- galatians 5:9
.
[For my part] I have confidence [toward you] in the Lord that you will take no contrary view of the matter but will come to think with me. But he who is unsettling you, whoever he is, will have to bear the penalty. -- galatians 5:10
.
But, brethren, if I still preach circumcision [as some accuse me of doing, as necessary to salvation], why am I still suffering persecution? In that case the cross has ceased to be a stumbling block and is made meaningless (done away). -- galatians 5:11
.
I wish those who unsettle and confuse you would [go all the way and] cut themselves off! -- galatians 5:12
.
For you, brethren, were [indeed] called to freedom; only [do not let your] freedom be an incentive to your flesh and an opportunity or excuse [for selfishness], but through love you should serve one another. -- galatians 5:13
.
For the whole Law [concerning human relationships] is complied with in the one precept, You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself. -- galatians 5:14
.
But if you bite and devour one another [in partisan strife], be careful that you [and your whole fellowship] are not consumed by one another. -- galatians 5:15
.
But I say, walk and live [habitually] in the [Holy] Spirit [responsive to and controlled and guided by the Spirit]; then you will certainly not gratify the cravings and desires of the flesh (of human nature without God). -- galatians 5:16
.
For the desires of the flesh are opposed to the [Holy] Spirit, and the [desires of the] Spirit are opposed to the flesh (godless human nature); for these are antagonistic to each other [continually withstanding and in conflict with each other], so that you are not free but are prevented from doing what you desire to do. -- galatians 5:17
.
But if you are guided (led) by the [Holy] Spirit, you are not subject to the Law. -- galatians 5:18
.
Now the doings (practices) of the flesh are clear (obvious): they are immorality, impurity, indecency, -- galatians 5:19
.
Idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger (ill temper), selfishness, divisions (dissensions), party spirit (factions, sects with peculiar opinions, heresies), -- galatians 5:20
.
Envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you beforehand, just as I did previously, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. -- galatians 5:21
.
But the fruit of the [Holy] Spirit [the work which His presence within accomplishes] is love, joy (gladness), peace, patience (an even temper, forbearance), kindness, goodness (benevolence), faithfulness, -- galatians 5:22
.
Gentleness (meekness, humility), self-control (self-restraint, continence). Against such things there is no law [that can bring a charge]. -- galatians 5:23
.
And those who belong to Christ Jesus (the Messiah) have crucified the flesh (the godless human nature) with its passions and appetites and desires. -- galatians 5:24
.
If we live by the [Holy] Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. [If by the Holy Spirit we have our life in God, let us go forward walking in line, our conduct controlled by the Spirit.] -- galatians 5:25
.
Let us not become vainglorious and self-conceited, competitive and challenging and provoking and irritating to one another, envying and being jealous of one another. -- galatians 5:26
.
BRETHREN, IF any person is overtaken in misconduct or sin of any sort, you who are spiritual [who are responsive to and controlled by the Spirit] should set him right and restore and reinstate him, without any sense of superiority and with all gentleness, keeping an attentive eye on yourself, lest you should be tempted also. -- galatians 6:1
.
Bear (endure, carry) one another's burdens and troublesome moral faults, and in this way fulfill and observe perfectly the law of Christ (the Messiah) and complete what is lacking [in your obedience to it]. -- galatians 6:2
.
For if any person thinks himself to be somebody [too important to condescend to shoulder another's load] when he is nobody [of superiority except in his own estimation], he deceives and deludes and cheats himself. -- galatians 6:3
.
But let every person carefully scrutinize and examine and test his own conduct and his own work. He can then have the personal satisfaction and joy of doing something commendable [in itself alone] without [resorting to] boastful comparison with his neighbor. -- galatians 6:4
.
For every person will have to bear (be equal to understanding and calmly receive) his own [little] load [of oppressive faults]. -- galatians 6:5
.
Let him who receives instruction in the Word [of God] share all good things with his teacher [contributing to his support]. -- galatians 6:6
.
Do not be deceived and deluded and misled; God will not allow Himself to be sneered at (scorned, disdained, or mocked by mere pretensions or professions, or by His precepts being set aside.) [He inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude God.] For whatever a man sows, that and that only is what he will reap. -- galatians 6:7
.
For he who sows to his own flesh (lower nature, sensuality) will from the flesh reap decay and ruin and destruction, but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. -- galatians 6:8
.
And let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right, for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap, if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint. -- galatians 6:9
.
So then, as occasion and opportunity open up to us, let us do good [morally] to all people [not only being useful or profitable to them, but also doing what is for their spiritual good and advantage]. Be mindful to be a blessing, especially to those of the household of faith [those who belong to God's family with you, the believers]. -- galatians 6:10
.
See with what large letters I am writing with my own hand. [Mark carefully these closing words of mine.] -- galatians 6:11
.
Those who want to make a good impression and a fine show in the flesh would try to compel you to receive circumcision, simply so that they may escape being persecuted for allegiance to the cross of Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- galatians 6:12
.
For even the circumcised [Jews] themselves do not [really] keep the Law, but they want to have you circumcised in order that they may glory in your flesh (your subjection to external rites). -- galatians 6:13
.
But far be it from me to glory [in anything or anyone] except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) through Whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world! -- galatians 6:14
.
For neither is circumcision [now] of any importance, nor uncircumcision, but [only] a new creation [the result of a new birth and a new nature in Christ Jesus, the Messiah]. -- galatians 6:15
.
Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule [who discipline themselves and regulate their lives by this principle], even upon the [true] Israel of God! -- galatians 6:16
.
From now on let no person trouble me [by making it necessary for me to vindicate my apostolic authority and the divine truth of my Gospel], for I bear on my body the [brand] marks of the Lord Jesus [the wounds, scars, and other outward evidence of persecutions--these testify to His ownership of me]! -- galatians 6:17
.
The grace (spiritual favor, blessing) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One, the Messiah) be with your spirit, brethren. Amen (so be it). -- galatians 6:18
.
PAUL, AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), by the divine will (the purpose and the choice of God) to the saints (the consecrated, set-apart ones) at Ephesus who are also faithful and loyal and steadfast in Christ Jesus: -- ephesians 1:1
.
May grace (God's unmerited favor) and spiritual peace [which means peace with God and harmony, unity, and undisturbedness] be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. -- ephesians 1:2
.
May blessing (praise, laudation, and eulogy) be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual (given by the Holy Spirit) blessing in the heavenly realm! -- ephesians 1:3
.
Even as [in His love] He chose us [actually picked us out for Himself as His own] in Christ before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy (consecrated and set apart for Him) and blameless in His sight, even above reproach, before Him in love. -- ephesians 1:4
.
For He foreordained us (destined us, planned in love for us) to be adopted (revealed) as His own children through Jesus Christ, in accordance with the purpose of His will [because it pleased Him and was His kind intent]-- -- ephesians 1:5
.
[So that we might be] to the praise and the commendation of His glorious grace (favor and mercy), which He so freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. -- ephesians 1:6
.
In Him we have redemption (deliverance and salvation) through His blood, the remission (forgiveness) of our offenses (shortcomings and trespasses), in accordance with the riches and the generosity of His gracious favor, -- ephesians 1:7
.
Which He lavished upon us in every kind of wisdom and understanding (practical insight and prudence), -- ephesians 1:8
.
Making known to us the mystery (secret) of His will (of His plan, of His purpose). [And it is this:] In accordance with His good pleasure (His merciful intention) which He had previously purposed and set forth in Him, -- ephesians 1:9
.
[He planned] for the maturity of the times and the climax of the ages to unify all things and head them up and consummate them in Christ, [both] things in heaven and things on the earth. -- ephesians 1:10
.
In Him we also were made [God's] heritage (portion) and we obtained an inheritance; for we had been foreordained (chosen and appointed beforehand) in accordance with His purpose, Who works out everything in agreement with the counsel and design of His [own] will, -- ephesians 1:11
.
So that we who first hoped in Christ [who first put our confidence in Him have been destined and appointed to] live for the praise of His glory! -- ephesians 1:12
.
In Him you also who have heard the Word of Truth, the glad tidings (Gospel) of your salvation, and have believed in and adhered to and relied on Him, were stamped with the seal of the long-promised Holy Spirit. -- ephesians 1:13
.
That [Spirit] is the guarantee of our inheritance [the firstfruits, the pledge and foretaste, the down payment on our heritage], in anticipation of its full redemption and our acquiring [complete] possession of it--to the praise of His glory. -- ephesians 1:14
.
For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints (the people of God), -- ephesians 1:15
.
I do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers. -- ephesians 1:16
.
[For I always pray to] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation [of insight into mysteries and secrets] in the [deep and intimate] knowledge of Him, -- ephesians 1:17
.
By having the eyes of your heart flooded with light, so that you can know and understand the hope to which He has called you, and how rich is His glorious inheritance in the saints (His set-apart ones), -- ephesians 1:18
.
And [so that you can know and understand] what is the immeasurable and unlimited and surpassing greatness of His power in and for us who believe, as demonstrated in the working of His mighty strength, -- ephesians 1:19
.
Which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His [own] right hand in the heavenly [places], -- ephesians 1:20
.
Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named [above every title that can be conferred], not only in this age and in this world, but also in the age and the world which are to come. -- ephesians 1:21
.
And He has put all things under His feet and has appointed Him the universal and supreme Head of the church [a headship exercised throughout the church], -- ephesians 1:22
.
Which is His body, the fullness of Him Who fills all in all [for in that body lives the full measure of Him Who makes everything complete, and Who fills everything everywhere with Himself]. -- ephesians 1:23
.
AND YOU [He made alive], when you were dead (slain) by [your] trespasses and sins -- ephesians 2:1
.
In which at one time you walked [habitually]. You were following the course and fashion of this world [were under the sway of the tendency of this present age], following the prince of the power of the air. [You were obedient to and under the control of] the [demon] spirit that still constantly works in the sons of disobedience [the careless, the rebellious, and the unbelieving, who go against the purposes of God]. -- ephesians 2:2
.
Among these we as well as you once lived and conducted ourselves in the passions of our flesh [our behavior governed by our corrupt and sensual nature], obeying the impulses of the flesh and the thoughts of the mind [our cravings dictated by our senses and our dark imaginings]. We were then by nature children of [God's] wrath and heirs of [His] indignation, like the rest of mankind. -- ephesians 2:3
.
But God--so rich is He in His mercy! Because of and in order to satisfy the great and wonderful and intense love with which He loved us, -- ephesians 2:4
.
Even when we were dead (slain) by [our own] shortcomings and trespasses, He made us alive together in fellowship and in union with Christ; [He gave us the very life of Christ Himself, the same new life with which He quickened Him, for] it is by grace (His favor and mercy which you did not deserve) that you are saved (delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ's salvation). -- ephesians 2:5
.
And He raised us up together with Him and made us sit down together [giving us joint seating with Him] in the heavenly sphere [by virtue of our being] in Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- ephesians 2:6
.
He did this that He might clearly demonstrate through the ages to come the immeasurable (limitless, surpassing) riches of His free grace (His unmerited favor) in [His] kindness and goodness of heart toward us in Christ Jesus. -- ephesians 2:7
.
For it is by free grace (God's unmerited favor) that you are saved (delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ's salvation) through [your] faith. And this [salvation] is not of yourselves [of your own doing, it came not through your own striving], but it is the gift of God; -- ephesians 2:8
.
Not because of works [not the fulfillment of the Law's demands], lest any man should boast. [It is not the result of what anyone can possibly do, so no one can pride himself in it or take glory to himself.] -- ephesians 2:9
.
For we are God's [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live]. -- ephesians 2:10
.
Therefore, remember that at one time you were Gentiles (heathens) in the flesh, called Uncircumcision by those who called themselves Circumcision, [itself a mere mark] in the flesh made by human hands. -- ephesians 2:11
.
[Remember] that you were at that time separated (living apart) from Christ [excluded from all part in Him], utterly estranged and outlawed from the rights of Israel as a nation, and strangers with no share in the sacred compacts of the [Messianic] promise [with no knowledge of or right in God's agreements, His covenants]. And you had no hope (no promise); you were in the world without God. -- ephesians 2:12
.
But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were [so] far away, through (by, in) the blood of Christ have been brought near. -- ephesians 2:13
.
For He is [Himself] our peace (our bond of unity and harmony). He has made us both [Jew and Gentile] one [body], and has broken down (destroyed, abolished) the hostile dividing wall between us, -- ephesians 2:14
.
By abolishing in His [own crucified] flesh the enmity [caused by] the Law with its decrees and ordinances [which He annulled]; that He from the two might create in Himself one new man [one new quality of humanity out of the two], so making peace. -- ephesians 2:15
.
And [He designed] to reconcile to God both [Jew and Gentile, united] in a single body by means of His cross, thereby killing the mutual enmity and bringing the feud to an end. -- ephesians 2:16
.
And He came and preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off and [peace] to those who were near. -- ephesians 2:17
.
For it is through Him that we both [whether far off or near] now have an introduction (access) by one [Holy] Spirit to the Father [so that we are able to approach Him]. -- ephesians 2:18
.
Therefore you are no longer outsiders (exiles, migrants, and aliens, excluded from the rights of citizens), but you now share citizenship with the saints (God's own people, consecrated and set apart for Himself); and you belong to God's [own] household. -- ephesians 2:19
.
You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus Himself the chief Cornerstone. -- ephesians 2:20
.
In Him the whole structure is joined (bound, welded) together harmoniously, and it continues to rise (grow, increase) into a holy temple in the Lord [a sanctuary dedicated, consecrated, and sacred to the presence of the Lord]. -- ephesians 2:21
.
In Him [and in fellowship with one another] you yourselves also are being built up [into this structure] with the rest, to form a fixed abode (dwelling place) of God in (by, through) the Spirit. -- ephesians 2:22
.
FOR THIS reason [because I preached that you are thus built up together], I, Paul, [am] the prisoner of Jesus the Christ for the sake and on behalf of you Gentiles-- -- ephesians 3:1
.
Assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace (His unmerited favor) that was entrusted to me [to dispense to you] for your benefit, -- ephesians 3:2
.
[And] that the mystery (secret) was made known to me and I was allowed to comprehend it by direct revelation, as I already briefly wrote you. -- ephesians 3:3
.
When you read this you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ. -- ephesians 3:4
.
[This mystery] was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles (consecrated messengers) and prophets by the [Holy] Spirit. -- ephesians 3:5
.
[It is this:] that the Gentiles are now to be fellow heirs [with the Jews], members of the same body and joint partakers [sharing] in the same divine promise in Christ through [their acceptance of] the glad tidings (the Gospel). -- ephesians 3:6
.
Of this [Gospel] I was made a minister according to the gift of God's free grace (undeserved favor) which was bestowed on me by the exercise (the working in all its effectiveness) of His power. -- ephesians 3:7
.
To me, though I am the very least of all the saints (God's consecrated people), this grace (favor, privilege) was granted and graciously entrusted: to proclaim to the Gentiles the unending (boundless, fathomless, incalculable, and exhaustless) riches of Christ [wealth which no human being could have searched out], -- ephesians 3:8
.
Also to enlighten all men and make plain to them what is the plan [regarding the Gentiles and providing for the salvation of all men] of the mystery kept hidden through the ages and concealed until now in [the mind of] God Who created all things by Christ Jesus. -- ephesians 3:9
.
[The purpose is] that through the church the complicated, many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety and innumerable aspects might now be made known to the angelic rulers and authorities (principalities and powers) in the heavenly sphere. -- ephesians 3:10
.
This is in accordance with the terms of the eternal and timeless purpose which He has realized and carried into effect in [the person of] Christ Jesus our Lord, -- ephesians 3:11
.
In Whom, because of our faith in Him, we dare to have the boldness (courage and confidence) of free access (an unreserved approach to God with freedom and without fear). -- ephesians 3:12
.
So I ask you not to lose heart [not to faint or become despondent through fear] at what I am suffering in your behalf. [Rather glory in it] for it is an honor to you. -- ephesians 3:13
.
For this reason [seeing the greatness of this plan by which you are built together in Christ], I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, -- ephesians 3:14
.
For Whom every family in heaven and on earth is named [that Father from Whom all fatherhood takes its title and derives its name]. -- ephesians 3:15
.
May He grant you out of the rich treasury of His glory to be strengthened and reinforced with mighty power in the inner man by the [Holy] Spirit [Himself indwelling your innermost being and personality]. -- ephesians 3:16
.
May Christ through your faith [actually] dwell (settle down, abide, make His permanent home) in your hearts! May you be rooted deep in love and founded securely on love, -- ephesians 3:17
.
That you may have the power and be strong to apprehend and grasp with all the saints [God's devoted people, the experience of that love] what is the breadth and length and height and depth [of it]; -- ephesians 3:18
.
[That you may really come] to know [practically, through experience for yourselves] the love of Christ, which far surpasses mere knowledge [without experience]; that you may be filled [through all your being] unto all the fullness of God [may have the richest measure of the divine Presence, and become a body wholly filled and flooded with God Himself]! -- ephesians 3:19
.
Now to Him Who, by (in consequence of) the [action of His] power that is at work within us, is able to [carry out His purpose and] do superabundantly, far over and above all that we [dare] ask or think [infinitely beyond our highest prayers, desires, thoughts, hopes, or dreams]-- -- ephesians 3:20
.
To Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever. Amen (so be it). -- ephesians 3:21
.
I THEREFORE, the prisoner for the Lord, appeal to and beg you to walk (lead a life) worthy of the [divine] calling to which you have been called [with behavior that is a credit to the summons to God's service, -- ephesians 4:1
.
Living as becomes you] with complete lowliness of mind (humility) and meekness (unselfishness, gentleness, mildness), with patience, bearing with one another and making allowances because you love one another. -- ephesians 4:2
.
Be eager and strive earnestly to guard and keep the harmony and oneness of [and produced by] the Spirit in the binding power of peace. -- ephesians 4:3
.
[There is] one body and one Spirit--just as there is also one hope [that belongs] to the calling you received-- -- ephesians 4:4
.
[There is] one Lord, one faith, one baptism, -- ephesians 4:5
.
One God and Father of [us] all, Who is above all [Sovereign over all], pervading all and [living] in [us] all. -- ephesians 4:6
.
Yet grace (God's unmerited favor) was given to each of us individually [not indiscriminately, but in different ways] in proportion to the measure of Christ's [rich and bounteous] gift. -- ephesians 4:7
.
Therefore it is said, When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive [He led a train of vanquished foes] and He bestowed gifts on men. -- ephesians 4:8
.
[But He ascended?] Now what can this, He ascended, mean but that He had previously descended from [the heights of] heaven into [the depths], the lower parts of the earth? -- ephesians 4:9
.
He Who descended is the [very] same as He Who also has ascended high above all the heavens, that He [His presence] might fill all things (the whole universe, from the lowest to the highest). -- ephesians 4:10
.
And His gifts were [varied; He Himself appointed and gave men to us] some to be apostles (special messengers), some prophets (inspired preachers and expounders), some evangelists (preachers of the Gospel, traveling missionaries), some pastors (shepherds of His flock) and teachers. -- ephesians 4:11
.
His intention was the perfecting and the full equipping of the saints (His consecrated people), [that they should do] the work of ministering toward building up Christ's body (the church), -- ephesians 4:12
.
[That it might develop] until we all attain oneness in the faith and in the comprehension of the [full and accurate] knowledge of the Son of God, that [we might arrive] at really mature manhood (the completeness of personality which is nothing less than the standard height of Christ's own perfection), the measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ and the completeness found in Him. -- ephesians 4:13
.
So then, we may no longer be children, tossed [like ships] to and fro between chance gusts of teaching and wavering with every changing wind of doctrine, [the prey of] the cunning and cleverness of unscrupulous men, [gamblers engaged] in every shifting form of trickery in inventing errors to mislead. -- ephesians 4:14
.
Rather, let our lives lovingly express truth [in all things, speaking truly, dealing truly, living truly]. Enfolded in love, let us grow up in every way and in all things into Him Who is the Head, [even] Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- ephesians 4:15
.
For because of Him the whole body (the church, in all its various parts), closely joined and firmly knit together by the joints and ligaments with which it is supplied, when each part [with power adapted to its need] is working properly [in all its functions], grows to full maturity, building itself up in love. -- ephesians 4:16
.
So this I say and solemnly testify in [the name of] the Lord [as in His presence], that you must no longer live as the heathen (the Gentiles) do in their perverseness [in the folly, vanity, and emptiness of their souls and the futility] of their minds. -- ephesians 4:17
.
Their moral understanding is darkened and their reasoning is beclouded. [They are] alienated (estranged, self-banished) from the life of God [with no share in it; this is] because of the ignorance (the want of knowledge and perception, the willful blindness) that is deep-seated in them, due to their hardness of heart [to the insensitiveness of their moral nature]. -- ephesians 4:18
.
In their spiritual apathy they have become callous and past feeling and reckless and have abandoned themselves [a prey] to unbridled sensuality, eager and greedy to indulge in every form of impurity [that their depraved desires may suggest and demand]. -- ephesians 4:19
.
But you did not so learn Christ! -- ephesians 4:20
.
Assuming that you have really heard Him and been taught by Him, as [all] Truth is in Jesus [embodied and personified in Him], -- ephesians 4:21
.
Strip yourselves of your former nature [put off and discard your old unrenewed self] which characterized your previous manner of life and becomes corrupt through lusts and desires that spring from delusion; -- ephesians 4:22
.
And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind [having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude], -- ephesians 4:23
.
And put on the new nature (the regenerate self) created in God's image, [Godlike] in true righteousness and holiness. -- ephesians 4:24
.
Therefore, rejecting all falsity and being done now with it, let everyone express the truth with his neighbor, for we are all parts of one body and members one of another. -- ephesians 4:25
.
When angry, do not sin; do not ever let your wrath (your exasperation, your fury or indignation) last until the sun goes down. -- ephesians 4:26
.
Leave no [such] room or foothold for the devil [give no opportunity to him]. -- ephesians 4:27
.
Let the thief steal no more, but rather let him be industrious, making an honest living with his own hands, so that he may be able to give to those in need. -- ephesians 4:28
.
Let no foul or polluting language, nor evil word nor unwholesome or worthless talk [ever] come out of your mouth, but only such [speech] as is good and beneficial to the spiritual progress of others, as is fitting to the need and the occasion, that it may be a blessing and give grace (God's favor) to those who hear it. -- ephesians 4:29
.
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God [do not offend or vex or sadden Him], by Whom you were sealed (marked, branded as God's own, secured) for the day of redemption (of final deliverance through Christ from evil and the consequences of sin). -- ephesians 4:30
.
Let all bitterness and indignation and wrath (passion, rage, bad temper) and resentment (anger, animosity) and quarreling (brawling, clamor, contention) and slander (evil-speaking, abusive or blasphemous language) be banished from you, with all malice (spite, ill will, or baseness of any kind). -- ephesians 4:31
.
And become useful and helpful and kind to one another, tenderhearted (compassionate, understanding, loving-hearted), forgiving one another [readily and freely], as God in Christ forgave you. -- ephesians 4:32
.
THEREFORE BE imitators of God [copy Him and follow His example], as well-beloved children [imitate their father]. -- ephesians 5:1
.
And walk in love, [esteeming and delighting in one another] as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a slain offering and sacrifice to God [for you, so that it became] a sweet fragrance. -- ephesians 5:2
.
But immorality (sexual vice) and all impurity [of lustful, rich, wasteful living] or greediness must not even be named among you, as is fitting and proper among saints (God's consecrated people). -- ephesians 5:3
.
Let there be no filthiness (obscenity, indecency) nor foolish and sinful (silly and corrupt) talk, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting or becoming; but instead voice your thankfulness [to God]. -- ephesians 5:4
.
For be sure of this: that no person practicing sexual vice or impurity in thought or in life, or one who is covetous [who has lustful desire for the property of others and is greedy for gain]--for he [in effect] is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. -- ephesians 5:5
.
Let no one delude and deceive you with empty excuses and groundless arguments [for these sins], for through these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of rebellion and disobedience. -- ephesians 5:6
.
So do not associate or be sharers with them. -- ephesians 5:7
.
For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of Light [lead the lives of those native-born to the Light]. -- ephesians 5:8
.
For the fruit (the effect, the product) of the Light or the Spirit [consists] in every form of kindly goodness, uprightness of heart, and trueness of life. -- ephesians 5:9
.
And try to learn [in your experience] what is pleasing to the Lord [let your lives be constant proofs of what is most acceptable to Him]. -- ephesians 5:10
.
Take no part in and have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds and enterprises of darkness, but instead [let your lives be so in contrast as to] expose and reprove and convict them. -- ephesians 5:11
.
For it is a shame even to speak of or mention the things that [such people] practice in secret. -- ephesians 5:12
.
But when anything is exposed and reproved by the light, it is made visible and clear; and where everything is visible and clear there is light. -- ephesians 5:13
.
Therefore He says, Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine (make day dawn) upon you and give you light. -- ephesians 5:14
.
Look carefully then how you walk! Live purposefully and worthily and accurately, not as the unwise and witless, but as wise (sensible, intelligent people), -- ephesians 5:15
.
Making the very most of the time [buying up each opportunity], because the days are evil. -- ephesians 5:16
.
Therefore do not be vague and thoughtless and foolish, but understanding and firmly grasping what the will of the Lord is. -- ephesians 5:17
.
And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but ever be filled and stimulated with the [Holy] Spirit. -- ephesians 5:18
.
Speak out to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, offering praise with voices [and instruments] and making melody with all your heart to the Lord, -- ephesians 5:19
.
At all times and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father. -- ephesians 5:20
.
Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- ephesians 5:21
.
Wives, be subject (be submissive and adapt yourselves) to your own husbands as [a service] to the Lord. -- ephesians 5:22
.
For the husband is head of the wife as Christ is the Head of the church, Himself the Savior of [His] body. -- ephesians 5:23
.
As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. -- ephesians 5:24
.
Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, -- ephesians 5:25
.
So that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word, -- ephesians 5:26
.
That He might present the church to Himself in glorious splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such things [that she might be holy and faultless]. -- ephesians 5:27
.
Even so husbands should love their wives as [being in a sense] their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself. -- ephesians 5:28
.
For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and carefully protects and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, -- ephesians 5:29
.
Because we are members (parts) of His body. -- ephesians 5:30
.
For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. -- ephesians 5:31
.
This mystery is very great, but I speak concerning [the relation of] Christ and the church. -- ephesians 5:32
.
However, let each man of you [without exception] love his wife as [being in a sense] his very own self; and let the wife see that she respects and reverences her husband [that she notices him, regards him, honors him, prefers him, venerates, and esteems him; and that she defers to him, praises him, and loves and admires him exceedingly]. [I Pet. 3:2.] -- ephesians 5:33
.
CHILDREN, OBEY your parents in the Lord [as His representatives], for this is just and right. -- ephesians 6:1
.
Honor (esteem and value as precious) your father and your mother--this is the first commandment with a promise-- -- ephesians 6:2
.
That all may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth. -- ephesians 6:3
.
Fathers, do not irritate and provoke your children to anger [do not exasperate them to resentment], but rear them [tenderly] in the training and discipline and the counsel and admonition of the Lord. -- ephesians 6:4
.
Servants (slaves), be obedient to those who are your physical masters, having respect for them and eager concern to please them, in singleness of motive and with all your heart, as [service] to Christ [Himself]-- -- ephesians 6:5
.
Not in the way of eye-service [as if they were watching you] and only to please men, but as servants (slaves) of Christ, doing the will of God heartily and with your whole soul; -- ephesians 6:6
.
Rendering service readily with goodwill, as to the Lord and not to men, -- ephesians 6:7
.
Knowing that for whatever good anyone does, he will receive his reward from the Lord, whether he is slave or free. -- ephesians 6:8
.
You masters, act on the same [principle] toward them and give up threatening and using violent and abusive words, knowing that He Who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no respect of persons (no partiality) with Him. -- ephesians 6:9
.
In conclusion, be strong in the Lord [be empowered through your union with Him]; draw your strength from Him [that strength which His boundless might provides]. -- ephesians 6:10
.
Put on God's whole armor [the armor of a heavy-armed soldier which God supplies], that you may be able successfully to stand up against [all] the strategies and the deceits of the devil. -- ephesians 6:11
.
For we are not wrestling with flesh and blood [contending only with physical opponents], but against the despotisms, against the powers, against [the master spirits who are] the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly (supernatural) sphere. -- ephesians 6:12
.
Therefore put on God's complete armor, that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day [of danger], and, having done all [the crisis demands], to stand [firmly in your place]. -- ephesians 6:13
.
Stand therefore [hold your ground], having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with God, -- ephesians 6:14
.
And having shod your feet in preparation [to face the enemy with the firm-footed stability, the promptness, and the readiness produced by the good news] of the Gospel of peace. -- ephesians 6:15
.
Lift up over all the [covering] shield of saving faith, upon which you can quench all the flaming missiles of the wicked [one]. -- ephesians 6:16
.
And take the helmet of salvation and the sword that the Spirit wields, which is the Word of God. -- ephesians 6:17
.
Pray at all times (on every occasion, in every season) in the Spirit, with all [manner of] prayer and entreaty. To that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance, interceding in behalf of all the saints (God's consecrated people). -- ephesians 6:18
.
And [pray] also for me, that [freedom of] utterance may be given me, that I may open my mouth to proclaim boldly the mystery of the good news (the Gospel), -- ephesians 6:19
.
For which I am an ambassador in a coupling chain [in prison. Pray] that I may declare it boldly and courageously, as I ought to do. -- ephesians 6:20
.
Now that you may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord [and His service], will tell you everything. -- ephesians 6:21
.
I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may console and cheer and encourage and strengthen your hearts. -- ephesians 6:22
.
Peace be to the brethren, and love joined with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- ephesians 6:23
.
Grace (God's undeserved favor) be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying and incorruptible [love]. Amen (so let it be). -- ephesians 6:24
.
PAUL AND Timothy, bond servants of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), to all the saints (God's consecrated people) in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops (overseers) and deacons (assistants): -- philippians 1:1
.
Grace (favor and blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- philippians 1:2
.
I thank my God in all my remembrance of you. -- philippians 1:3
.
In every prayer of mine I always make my entreaty and petition for you all with joy (delight). -- philippians 1:4
.
[I thank my God] for your fellowship (your sympathetic cooperation and contributions and partnership) in advancing the good news (the Gospel) from the first day [you heard it] until now. -- philippians 1:5
.
And I am convinced and sure of this very thing, that He Who began a good work in you will continue until the day of Jesus Christ [right up to the time of His return], developing [that good work] and perfecting and bringing it to full completion in you. -- philippians 1:6
.
It is right and appropriate for me to have this confidence and feel this way about you all, because you have me in your heart and I hold you in my heart as partakers and sharers, one and all with me, of grace (God's unmerited favor and spiritual blessing). [This is true] both when I am shut up in prison and when I am out in the defense and confirmation of the good news (the Gospel). -- philippians 1:7
.
For God is my witness how I long for and pursue you all with love, in the tender mercy of Christ Jesus [Himself]! -- philippians 1:8
.
And this I pray: that your love may abound yet more and more and extend to its fullest development in knowledge and all keen insight [that your love may display itself in greater depth of acquaintance and more comprehensive discernment], -- philippians 1:9
.
So that you may surely learn to sense what is vital, and approve and prize what is excellent and of real value [recognizing the highest and the best, and distinguishing the moral differences], and that you may be untainted and pure and unerring and blameless [so that with hearts sincere and certain and unsullied, you may approach] the day of Christ [not stumbling nor causing others to stumble]. -- philippians 1:10
.
May you abound in and be filled with the fruits of righteousness (of right standing with God and right doing) which come through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One), to the honor and praise of God [that His glory may be both manifested and recognized]. -- philippians 1:11
.
Now I want you to know and continue to rest assured, brethren, that what [has happened] to me [this imprisonment] has actually only served to advance and give a renewed impetus to the [spreading of the] good news (the Gospel). -- philippians 1:12
.
So much is this a fact that throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest [here] my imprisonment has become generally known to be in Christ [that I am a prisoner in His service and for Him]. -- philippians 1:13
.
And [also] most of the brethren have derived fresh confidence in the Lord because of my chains and are much more bold to speak and publish fearlessly the Word of God [acting with more freedom and indifference to the consequences]. -- philippians 1:14
.
Some, it is true, [actually] preach Christ (the Messiah) [for no better reason than] out of envy and rivalry (party spirit), but others are doing so out of a loyal spirit and goodwill. -- philippians 1:15
.
The latter [proclaim Christ] out of love, because they recognize and know that I am [providentially] put here for the defense of the good news (the Gospel). -- philippians 1:16
.
But the former preach Christ out of a party spirit, insincerely [out of no pure motive, but thinking to annoy me], supposing they are making my bondage more bitter and my chains more galling. -- philippians 1:17
.
But what does it matter, so long as either way, whether in pretense [for personal ends] or in all honesty [for the furtherance of the Truth], Christ is being proclaimed? And in that I [now] rejoice, yes, and I shall rejoice [hereafter] also. -- philippians 1:18
.
For I am well assured and indeed know that through your prayers and a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) this will turn out for my preservation (for the spiritual health and welfare of my own soul) and avail toward the saving work of the Gospel. -- philippians 1:19
.
This is in keeping with my own eager desire and persistent expectation and hope, that I shall not disgrace myself nor be put to shame in anything; but that with the utmost freedom of speech and unfailing courage, now as always heretofore, Christ (the Messiah) will be magnified and get glory and praise in this body of mine and be boldly exalted in my person, whether through (by) life or through (by) death. -- philippians 1:20
.
For me to live is Christ [His life in me], and to die is gain [the gain of the glory of eternity]. -- philippians 1:21
.
If, however, it is to be life in the flesh and I am to live on here, that means fruitful service for me; so I can say nothing as to my personal preference [I cannot choose], -- philippians 1:22
.
But I am hard pressed between the two. My yearning desire is to depart (to be free of this world, to set forth) and be with Christ, for that is far, far better; -- philippians 1:23
.
But to remain in my body is more needful and essential for your sake. -- philippians 1:24
.
Since I am convinced of this, I know that I shall remain and stay by you all, to promote your progress and joy in believing, -- philippians 1:25
.
So that in me you may have abundant cause for exultation and glorying in Christ Jesus, through my coming to you again. -- philippians 1:26
.
Only be sure as citizens so to conduct yourselves [that] your manner of life [will be] worthy of the good news (the Gospel) of Christ, so that whether I [do] come and see you or am absent, I may hear this of you: that you are standing firm in united spirit and purpose, striving side by side and contending with a single mind for the faith of the glad tidings (the Gospel). -- philippians 1:27
.
And do not [for a moment] be frightened or intimidated in anything by your opponents and adversaries, for such [constancy and fearlessness] will be a clear sign (proof and seal) to them of [their impending] destruction, but [a sure token and evidence] of your deliverance and salvation, and that from God. -- philippians 1:28
.
For you have been granted [the privilege] for Christ's sake not only to believe in (adhere to, rely on, and trust in) Him, but also to suffer in His behalf. -- philippians 1:29
.
So you are engaged in the same conflict which you saw me [wage] and which you now hear to be mine [still]. -- philippians 1:30
.
SO BY whatever [appeal to you there is in our mutual dwelling in Christ, by whatever] strengthening and consoling and encouraging [our relationship] in Him [affords], by whatever persuasive incentive there is in love, by whatever participation in the [Holy] Spirit [we share], and by whatever depth of affection and compassionate sympathy, -- philippians 2:1
.
Fill up and complete my joy by living in harmony and being of the same mind and one in purpose, having the same love, being in full accord and of one harmonious mind and intention. -- philippians 2:2
.
Do nothing from factional motives [through contentiousness, strife, selfishness, or for unworthy ends] or prompted by conceit and empty arrogance. Instead, in the true spirit of humility (lowliness of mind) let each regard the others as better than and superior to himself [thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourselves]. -- philippians 2:3
.
Let each of you esteem and look upon and be concerned for not [merely] his own interests, but also each for the interests of others. -- philippians 2:4
.
Let this same attitude and purpose and [humble] mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus: [Let Him be your example in humility:] -- philippians 2:5
.
Who, although being essentially one with God and in the form of God [possessing the fullness of the attributes which make God God], did not think this equality with God was a thing to be eagerly grasped or retained, -- philippians 2:6
.
But stripped Himself [of all privileges and rightful dignity], so as to assume the guise of a servant (slave), in that He became like men and was born a human being. -- philippians 2:7
.
And after He had appeared in human form, He abased and humbled Himself [still further] and carried His obedience to the extreme of death, even the death of the cross! -- philippians 2:8
.
Therefore [because He stooped so low] God has highly exalted Him and has freely bestowed on Him the name that is above every name, -- philippians 2:9
.
That in (at) the name of Jesus every knee should (must) bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, -- philippians 2:10
.
And every tongue [frankly and openly] confess and acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. -- philippians 2:11
.
Therefore, my dear ones, as you have always obeyed [my suggestions], so now, not only [with the enthusiasm you would show] in my presence but much more because I am absent, work out (cultivate, carry out to the goal, and fully complete) your own salvation with reverence and awe and trembling (self-distrust, with serious caution, tenderness of conscience, watchfulness against temptation, timidly shrinking from whatever might offend God and discredit the name of Christ). -- philippians 2:12
.
[Not in your own strength] for it is God Who is all the while effectually at work in you [energizing and creating in you the power and desire], both to will and to work for His good pleasure and satisfaction and delight. -- philippians 2:13
.
Do all things without grumbling and faultfinding and complaining [against God] and questioning and doubting [among yourselves], -- philippians 2:14
.
That you may show yourselves to be blameless and guileless, innocent and uncontaminated, children of God without blemish (faultless, unrebukable) in the midst of a crooked and wicked generation [spiritually perverted and perverse], among whom you are seen as bright lights (stars or beacons shining out clearly) in the [dark] world, -- philippians 2:15
.
Holding out [to it] and offering [to all men] the Word of Life, so that in the day of Christ I may have something of which exultantly to rejoice and glory in that I did not run my race in vain or spend my labor to no purpose. -- philippians 2:16
.
Even if [my lifeblood] must be poured out as a libation on the sacrificial offering of your faith [to God], still I am glad [to do it] and congratulate you all on [your share in] it. -- philippians 2:17
.
And you also in like manner be glad and congratulate me on [my share in] it. -- philippians 2:18
.
But I hope and trust in the Lord Jesus soon to send Timothy to you, so that I may also be encouraged and cheered by learning news of you. -- philippians 2:19
.
For I have no one like him [no one of so kindred a spirit] who will be so genuinely interested in your welfare and devoted to your interests. -- philippians 2:20
.
For the others all seek [to advance] their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- philippians 2:21
.
But Timothy's tested worth you know, how as a son with his father he has toiled with me zealously in [serving and helping to advance] the good news (the Gospel). -- philippians 2:22
.
I hope therefore to send him promptly, just as soon as I know how my case is going to turn out. -- philippians 2:23
.
But [really] I am confident and fully trusting in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come to you also. -- philippians 2:24
.
However, I thought it necessary to send Epaphroditus [back] to you. [He has been] my brother and companion in labor and my fellow soldier, as well as [having come as] your special messenger (apostle) and minister to my need. -- philippians 2:25
.
For he has been [homesick] longing for you all and has been distressed because you had heard that he was ill. -- philippians 2:26
.
He certainly was ill [too], near to death. But God had compassion on him, and not only on him but also on me, lest I should have sorrow [over him] coming upon sorrow. -- philippians 2:27
.
So I have sent him the more willingly and eagerly, that you may be gladdened at seeing him again, and that I may be the less disquieted. -- philippians 2:28
.
Welcome him [home] then in the Lord with all joy, and honor and highly appreciate men like him, -- philippians 2:29
.
For it was through working for Christ that he came so near death, risking his [very] life to complete the deficiencies in your service to me [which distance prevented you yourselves from rendering]. -- philippians 2:30
.
FOR THE rest, my brethren, delight yourselves in the Lord and continue to rejoice that you are in Him. To keep writing to you [over and over] of the same things is not irksome to me, and it is [a precaution] for your safety. -- philippians 3:1
.
Look out for those dogs [Judaizers, legalists], look out for those mischief-makers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. -- philippians 3:2
.
For we [Christians] are the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit and by the Spirit of God and exult and glory and pride ourselves in Jesus Christ, and put no confidence or dependence [on what we are] in the flesh and on outward privileges and physical advantages and external appearances-- -- philippians 3:3
.
Though for myself I have [at least grounds] to rely on the flesh. If any other man considers that he has or seems to have reason to rely on the flesh and his physical and outward advantages, I have still more! -- philippians 3:4
.
Circumcised when I was eight days old, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew [and the son] of Hebrews; as to the observance of the Law I was of [the party of] the Pharisees, -- philippians 3:5
.
As to my zeal, I was a persecutor of the church, and by the Law's standard of righteousness (supposed justice, uprightness, and right standing with God) I was proven to be blameless and no fault was found with me. -- philippians 3:6
.
But whatever former things I had that might have been gains to me, I have come to consider as [one combined] loss for Christ's sake. -- philippians 3:7
.
Yes, furthermore, I count everything as loss compared to the possession of the priceless privilege (the overwhelming preciousness, the surpassing worth, and supreme advantage) of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and of progressively becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him [of perceiving and recognizing and understanding Him more fully and clearly]. For His sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish (refuse, dregs), in order that I may win (gain) Christ (the Anointed One), -- philippians 3:8
.
And that I may [actually] be found and known as in Him, not having any [self-achieved] righteousness that can be called my own, based on my obedience to the Law's demands (ritualistic uprightness and supposed right standing with God thus acquired), but possessing that [genuine righteousness] which comes through faith in Christ (the Anointed One), the [truly] right standing with God, which comes from God by [saving] faith. -- philippians 3:9
.
[For my determined purpose is] that I may know Him [that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him, perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of His Person more strongly and more clearly], and that I may in that same way come to know the power outflowing from His resurrection [which it exerts over believers], and that I may so share His sufferings as to be continually transformed [in spirit into His likeness even] to His death, [in the hope] -- philippians 3:10
.
That if possible I may attain to the [spiritual and moral] resurrection [that lifts me] out from among the dead [even while in the body]. -- philippians 3:11
.
Not that I have now attained [this ideal], or have already been made perfect, but I press on to lay hold of (grasp) and make my own, that for which Christ Jesus (the Messiah) has laid hold of me and made me His own. -- philippians 3:12
.
I do not consider, brethren, that I have captured and made it my own [yet]; but one thing I do [it is my one aspiration]: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, -- philippians 3:13
.
I press on toward the goal to win the [supreme and heavenly] prize to which God in Christ Jesus is calling us upward. -- philippians 3:14
.
So let those [of us] who are spiritually mature and full-grown have this mind and hold these convictions; and if in any respect you have a different attitude of mind, God will make that clear to you also. -- philippians 3:15
.
Only let us hold true to what we have already attained and walk and order our lives by that. -- philippians 3:16
.
Brethren, together follow my example and observe those who live after the pattern we have set for you. -- philippians 3:17
.
For there are many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, who walk (live) as enemies of the cross of Christ (the Anointed One). -- philippians 3:18
.
They are doomed and their fate is eternal misery (perdition); their god is their stomach (their appetites, their sensuality) and they glory in their shame, siding with earthly things and being of their party. -- philippians 3:19
.
But we are citizens of the state (commonwealth, homeland) which is in heaven, and from it also we earnestly and patiently await [the coming of] the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [as] Savior, -- philippians 3:20
.
Who will transform and fashion anew the body of our humiliation to conform to and be like the body of His glory and majesty, by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself. -- philippians 3:21
.
THEREFORE, MY brethren, whom I love and yearn to see, my delight and crown (wreath of victory), thus stand firm in the Lord, my beloved. -- philippians 4:1
.
I entreat and advise Euodia and I entreat and advise Syntyche to agree and to work in harmony in the Lord. -- philippians 4:2
.
And I exhort you too, [my] genuine yokefellow, help these [two women to keep on cooperating], for they have toiled along with me in [the spreading of] the good news (the Gospel), as have Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the Book of Life. -- philippians 4:3
.
Rejoice in the Lord always [delight, gladden yourselves in Him]; again I say, Rejoice! -- philippians 4:4
.
Let all men know and perceive and recognize your unselfishness (your considerateness, your forbearing spirit). The Lord is near [He is coming soon]. -- philippians 4:5
.
Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance and in everything, by prayer and petition (definite requests), with thanksgiving, continue to make your wants known to God. -- philippians 4:6
.
And God's peace [shall be yours, that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is, that peace] which transcends all understanding shall garrison and mount guard over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. -- philippians 4:7
.
For the rest, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely and lovable, whatever is kind and winsome and gracious, if there is any virtue and excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think on and weigh and take account of these things [fix your minds on them]. -- philippians 4:8
.
Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and model your way of living on it, and the God of peace (of untroubled, undisturbed well-being) will be with you. -- philippians 4:9
.
I was made very happy in the Lord that now you have revived your interest in my welfare after so long a time; you were indeed thinking of me, but you had no opportunity to show it. -- philippians 4:10
.
Not that I am implying that I was in any personal want, for I have learned how to be content (satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or disquieted) in whatever state I am. -- philippians 4:11
.
I know how to be abased and live humbly in straitened circumstances, and I know also how to enjoy plenty and live in abundance. I have learned in any and all circumstances the secret of facing every situation, whether well-fed or going hungry, having a sufficiency and enough to spare or going without and being in want. -- philippians 4:12
.
I have strength for all things in Christ Who empowers me [I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him Who infuses inner strength into me; I am self-sufficient in Christ's sufficiency]. -- philippians 4:13
.
But it was right and commendable and noble of you to contribute for my needs and to share my difficulties with me. -- philippians 4:14
.
And you Philippians yourselves well know that in the early days of the Gospel ministry, when I left Macedonia, no church (assembly) entered into partnership with me and opened up [a debit and credit] account in giving and receiving except you only. -- philippians 4:15
.
For even in Thessalonica you sent [me contributions] for my needs, not only once but a second time. -- philippians 4:16
.
Not that I seek or am eager for [your] gift, but I do seek and am eager for the fruit which increases to your credit [the harvest of blessing that is accumulating to your account]. -- philippians 4:17
.
But I have [your full payment] and more; I have everything I need and am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me. [They are the] fragrant odor of an offering and sacrifice which God welcomes and in which He delights. -- philippians 4:18
.
And my God will liberally supply (fill to the full) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. -- philippians 4:19
.
To our God and Father be glory forever and ever (through the endless eternities of the eternities). Amen (so be it). -- philippians 4:20
.
Remember me to every saint (every born-again believer) in Christ Jesus. The brethren (my associates) who are with me greet you. -- philippians 4:21
.
All the saints (God's consecrated ones here) wish to be remembered to you, especially those of Caesar's household. -- philippians 4:22
.
The grace (spiritual favor and blessing) of the Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) be with your spirit. Amen (so be it). -- philippians 4:23
.
PAUL, AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, -- colossians 1:1
.
To the saints (the consecrated people of God) and believing and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace (spiritual favor and blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father. -- colossians 1:2
.
We continually give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah), as we are praying for you, -- colossians 1:3
.
For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus [the leaning of your entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness] and of the love which you [have and show] for all the saints (God's consecrated ones), -- colossians 1:4
.
Because of the hope [of experiencing what is] laid up (reserved and waiting) for you in heaven. Of this [hope] you heard in the past in the message of the truth of the Gospel, -- colossians 1:5
.
Which has come to you. Indeed, in the whole world [that Gospel] is bearing fruit and still is growing [by its own inherent power], even as it has done among yourselves ever since the day you first heard and came to know and understand the grace of God in truth. [You came to know the grace or undeserved favor of God in reality, deeply and clearly and thoroughly, becoming accurately and intimately acquainted with it.] -- colossians 1:6
.
You so learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ in our stead and as our representative and yours. -- colossians 1:7
.
Also he has informed us of your love in the [Holy] Spirit. -- colossians 1:8
.
For this reason we also, from the day we heard of it, have not ceased to pray and make [special] request for you, [asking] that you may be filled with the full (deep and clear) knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God] and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things-- -- colossians 1:9
.
That you may walk (live and conduct yourselves) in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him and desiring to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of God [with fuller, deeper, and clearer insight, acquaintance, and recognition]. -- colossians 1:10
.
[We pray] that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of His glory, [to exercise] every kind of endurance and patience (perseverance and forbearance) with joy, -- colossians 1:11
.
Giving thanks to the Father, Who has qualified and made us fit to share the portion which is the inheritance of the saints (God's holy people) in the Light. -- colossians 1:12
.
[The Father] has delivered and drawn us to Himself out of the control and the dominion of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, -- colossians 1:13
.
In Whom we have our redemption through His blood, [which means] the forgiveness of our sins. -- colossians 1:14
.
[Now] He is the exact likeness of the unseen God [the visible representation of the invisible]; He is the Firstborn of all creation. -- colossians 1:15
.
For it was in Him that all things were created, in heaven and on earth, things seen and things unseen, whether thrones, dominions, rulers, or authorities; all things were created and exist through Him [by His service, intervention] and in and for Him. -- colossians 1:16
.
And He Himself existed before all things, and in Him all things consist (cohere, are held together). -- colossians 1:17
.
He also is the Head of [His] body, the church; seeing He is the Beginning, the Firstborn from among the dead, so that He alone in everything and in every respect might occupy the chief place [stand first and be preeminent]. -- colossians 1:18
.
For it has pleased [the Father] that all the divine fullness (the sum total of the divine perfection, powers, and attributes) should dwell in Him permanently. -- colossians 1:19
.
And God purposed that through (by the service, the intervention of) Him [the Son] all things should be completely reconciled back to Himself, whether on earth or in heaven, as through Him, [the Father] made peace by means of the blood of His cross. -- colossians 1:20
.
And although you at one time were estranged and alienated from Him and were of hostile attitude of mind in your wicked activities, -- colossians 1:21
.
Yet now has [Christ, the Messiah] reconciled [you to God] in the body of His flesh through death, in order to present you holy and faultless and irreproachable in His [the Father's] presence. -- colossians 1:22
.
[And this He will do] provided that you continue to stay with and in the faith [in Christ], well-grounded and settled and steadfast, not shifting or moving away from the hope [which rests on and is inspired by] the glad tidings (the Gospel), which you heard and which has been preached [as being designed for and offered without restrictions] to every person under heaven, and of which [Gospel] I, Paul, became a minister. -- colossians 1:23
.
[Even] now I rejoice in the midst of my sufferings on your behalf. And in my own person I am making up whatever is still lacking and remains to be completed [on our part] of Christ's afflictions, for the sake of His body, which is the church. -- colossians 1:24
.
In it I became a minister in accordance with the divine stewardship which was entrusted to me for you [as its object and for your benefit], to make the Word of God fully known [among you]-- -- colossians 1:25
.
The mystery of which was hidden for ages and generations [from angels and men], but is now revealed to His holy people (the saints), -- colossians 1:26
.
To whom God was pleased to make known how great for the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ within and among you, the Hope of [realizing the] glory. -- colossians 1:27
.
Him we preach and proclaim, warning and admonishing everyone and instructing everyone in all wisdom (comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God), that we may present every person mature (full-grown, fully initiated, complete, and perfect) in Christ (the Anointed One). -- colossians 1:28
.
For this I labor [unto weariness], striving with all the superhuman energy which He so mightily enkindles and works within me. -- colossians 1:29
.
FOR I want you to know how great is my solicitude for you [how severe an inward struggle I am engaged in for you] and for those [believers] at Laodicea, and for all who [like yourselves] have never seen my face and known me personally. -- colossians 2:1
.
[For my concern is] that their hearts may be braced (comforted, cheered, and encouraged) as they are knit together in love, that they may come to have all the abounding wealth and blessings of assured conviction of understanding, and that they may become progressively more intimately acquainted with and may know more definitely and accurately and thoroughly that mystic secret of God, [which is] Christ (the Anointed One). -- colossians 2:2
.
In Him all the treasures of [divine] wisdom (comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God) and [all the riches of spiritual] knowledge and enlightenment are stored up and lie hidden. -- colossians 2:3
.
I say this in order that no one may mislead and delude you by plausible and persuasive and attractive arguments and beguiling speech. -- colossians 2:4
.
For though I am away from you in body, yet I am with you in spirit, delighted at the sight of your [standing shoulder to shoulder in such] orderly array and the firmness and the solid front and steadfastness of your faith in Christ [that leaning of the entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness]. -- colossians 2:5
.
As you have therefore received Christ, [even] Jesus the Lord, [so] walk (regulate your lives and conduct yourselves) in union with and conformity to Him. -- colossians 2:6
.
Have the roots [of your being] firmly and deeply planted [in Him, fixed and founded in Him], being continually built up in Him, becoming increasingly more confirmed and established in the faith, just as you were taught, and abounding and overflowing in it with thanksgiving. -- colossians 2:7
.
See to it that no one carries you off as spoil or makes you yourselves captive by his so-called philosophy and intellectualism and vain deceit (idle fancies and plain nonsense), following human tradition (men's ideas of the material rather than the spiritual world), just crude notions following the rudimentary and elemental teachings of the universe and disregarding [the teachings of] Christ (the Messiah). -- colossians 2:8
.
For in Him the whole fullness of Deity (the Godhead) continues to dwell in bodily form [giving complete expression of the divine nature]. -- colossians 2:9
.
And you are in Him, made full and having come to fullness of life [in Christ you too are filled with the Godhead--Father, Son and Holy Spirit--and reach full spiritual stature]. And He is the Head of all rule and authority [of every angelic principality and power]. -- colossians 2:10
.
In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, but in a [spiritual] circumcision [performed by] Christ by stripping off the body of the flesh (the whole corrupt, carnal nature with its passions and lusts). -- colossians 2:11
.
[Thus you were circumcised when] you were buried with Him in [your] baptism, in which you were also raised with Him [to a new life] through [your] faith in the working of God [as displayed] when He raised Him up from the dead. -- colossians 2:12
.
And you who were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh (your sensuality, your sinful carnal nature), [God] brought to life together with [Christ], having [freely] forgiven us all our transgressions, -- colossians 2:13
.
Having cancelled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note (bond) with its legal decrees and demands which was in force and stood against us (hostile to us). This [note with its regulations, decrees, and demands] He set aside and cleared completely out of our way by nailing it to [His] cross. -- colossians 2:14
.
[God] disarmed the principalities and powers that were ranged against us and made a bold display and public example of them, in triumphing over them in Him and in it [the cross]. -- colossians 2:15
.
Therefore let no one sit in judgment on you in matters of food and drink, or with regard to a feast day or a New Moon or a Sabbath. -- colossians 2:16
.
Such [things] are only the shadow of things that are to come, and they have only a symbolic value. But the reality (the substance, the solid fact of what is foreshadowed, the body of it) belongs to Christ. -- colossians 2:17
.
Let no one defraud you by acting as an umpire and declaring you unworthy and disqualifying you for the prize, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, taking his stand on visions [he claims] he has seen, vainly puffed up by his sensuous notions and inflated by his unspiritual thoughts and fleshly conceit, -- colossians 2:18
.
And not holding fast to the Head, from Whom the entire body, supplied and knit together by means of its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. -- colossians 2:19
.
If then you have died with Christ to material ways of looking at things and have escaped from the world's crude and elemental notions and teachings of externalism, why do you live as if you still belong to the world? [Why do you submit to rules and regulations?--such as] -- colossians 2:20
.
Do not handle [this], Do not taste [that], Do not even touch [them], -- colossians 2:21
.
Referring to things all of which perish with being used. To do this is to follow human precepts and doctrines. -- colossians 2:22
.
Such [practices] have indeed the outward appearance [that popularly passes] for wisdom, in promoting self-imposed rigor of devotion and delight in self-humiliation and severity of discipline of the body, but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh (the lower nature). [Instead, they do not honor God but serve only to indulge the flesh.] -- colossians 2:23
.
IF THEN you have been raised with Christ [to a new life, thus sharing His resurrection from the dead], aim at and seek the [rich, eternal treasures] that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. -- colossians 3:1
.
And set your minds and keep them set on what is above (the higher things), not on the things that are on the earth. -- colossians 3:2
.
For [as far as this world is concerned] you have died, and your [new, real] life is hidden with Christ in God. -- colossians 3:3
.
When Christ, Who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in [the splendor of His] glory. -- colossians 3:4
.
So kill (deaden, deprive of power) the evil desire lurking in your members [those animal impulses and all that is earthly in you that is employed in sin]: sexual vice, impurity, sensual appetites, unholy desires, and all greed and covetousness, for that is idolatry (the deifying of self and other created things instead of God). -- colossians 3:5
.
It is on account of these [very sins] that the [holy] anger of God is ever coming upon the sons of disobedience (those who are obstinately opposed to the divine will), -- colossians 3:6
.
Among whom you also once walked, when you were living in and addicted to [such practices]. -- colossians 3:7
.
But now put away and rid yourselves [completely] of all these things: anger, rage, bad feeling toward others, curses and slander, and foulmouthed abuse and shameful utterances from your lips! -- colossians 3:8
.
Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off the old (unregenerate) self with its evil practices, -- colossians 3:9
.
And have clothed yourselves with the new [spiritual self], which is [ever in the process of being] renewed and remolded into [fuller and more perfect knowledge upon] knowledge after the image (the likeness) of Him Who created it. -- colossians 3:10
.
[In this new creation all distinctions vanish.] There is no room for and there can be neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, [nor difference between nations whether alien] barbarians or Scythians [who are the most savage of all], nor slave or free man; but Christ is all and in all [everything and everywhere, to all men, without distinction of person]. -- colossians 3:11
.
Clothe yourselves therefore, as God's own chosen ones (His own picked representatives), [who are] purified and holy and well-beloved [by God Himself, by putting on behavior marked by] tenderhearted pity and mercy, kind feeling, a lowly opinion of yourselves, gentle ways, [and] patience [which is tireless and long-suffering, and has the power to endure whatever comes, with good temper]. -- colossians 3:12
.
Be gentle and forbearing with one another and, if one has a difference (a grievance or complaint) against another, readily pardoning each other; even as the Lord has [freely] forgiven you, so must you also [forgive]. -- colossians 3:13
.
And above all these [put on] love and enfold yourselves with the bond of perfectness [which binds everything together completely in ideal harmony]. -- colossians 3:14
.
And let the peace (soul harmony which comes) from Christ rule (act as umpire continually) in your hearts [deciding and settling with finality all questions that arise in your minds, in that peaceful state] to which as [members of Christ's] one body you were also called [to live]. And be thankful (appreciative), [giving praise to God always]. -- colossians 3:15
.
Let the word [spoken by] Christ (the Messiah) have its home [in your hearts and minds] and dwell in you in [all its] richness, as you teach and admonish and train one another in all insight and intelligence and wisdom [in spiritual things, and as you sing] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, making melody to God with [His] grace in your hearts. -- colossians 3:16
.
And whatever you do [no matter what it is] in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus and in [dependence upon] His Person, giving praise to God the Father through Him. -- colossians 3:17
.
Wives, be subject to your husbands [subordinate and adapt yourselves to them], as is right and fitting and your proper duty in the Lord. -- colossians 3:18
.
Husbands, love your wives [be affectionate and sympathetic with them] and do not be harsh or bitter or resentful toward them. -- colossians 3:19
.
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord. -- colossians 3:20
.
Fathers, do not provoke or irritate or fret your children [do not be hard on them or harass them], lest they become discouraged and sullen and morose and feel inferior and frustrated. [Do not break their spirit.] -- colossians 3:21
.
Servants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you as pleasers of men, but in simplicity of purpose [with all your heart] because of your reverence for the Lord and as a sincere expression of your devotion to Him. -- colossians 3:22
.
Whatever may be your task, work at it heartily (from the soul), as [something done] for the Lord and not for men, -- colossians 3:23
.
Knowing [with all certainty] that it is from the Lord [and not from men] that you will receive the inheritance which is your [real] reward. [The One Whom] you are actually serving [is] the Lord Christ (the Messiah). -- colossians 3:24
.
For he who deals wrongfully will [reap the fruit of his folly and] be punished for his wrongdoing. And [with God] there is no partiality [no matter what a person's position may be, whether he is the slave or the master]. -- colossians 3:25
.
MASTERS, [on your part] deal with your slaves justly and fairly, knowing that also you have a Master in heaven. -- colossians 4:1
.
Be earnest and unwearied and steadfast in your prayer [life], being [both] alert and intent in [your praying] with thanksgiving. -- colossians 4:2
.
And at the same time pray for us also, that God may open a door to us for the Word (the Gospel), to proclaim the mystery concerning Christ (the Messiah) on account of which I am in prison; -- colossians 4:3
.
That I may proclaim it fully and make it clear [speak boldly and unfold that mystery], as is my duty. -- colossians 4:4
.
Behave yourselves wisely [living prudently and with discretion] in your relations with those of the outside world (the non-Christians), making the very most of the time and seizing (buying up) the opportunity. -- colossians 4:5
.
Let your speech at all times be gracious (pleasant and winsome), seasoned [as it were] with salt, [so that you may never be at a loss] to know how you ought to answer anyone [who puts a question to you]. -- colossians 4:6
.
Tychicus will give you full information about my affairs; [he is] a much-loved brother and faithful ministering assistant and fellow servant [with us] in the Lord. -- colossians 4:7
.
I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are faring and that he may comfort and cheer and encourage your hearts. -- colossians 4:8
.
And with [him is] Onesimus, [our] faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of yourselves. They will let you know everything that has taken place here [in Rome]. -- colossians 4:9
.
Aristarchus my fellow prisoner wishes to be remembered to you, as does Mark the relative of Barnabas. You received instructions concerning him; if he comes to you give him a [hearty] welcome. -- colossians 4:10
.
And [greetings also from] Jesus, who is called Justus. These [Hebrew Christians] alone of the circumcision are among my fellow workers for [the extension of] God's kingdom, and they have proved a relief and a comfort to me. -- colossians 4:11
.
Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. [He is] always striving for you earnestly in his prayers, [pleading] that you may [as persons of ripe character and clear conviction] stand firm and mature [in spiritual growth], convinced and fully assured in everything willed by God. -- colossians 4:12
.
For I bear him testimony that he has labored hard in your behalf and for [the believers] in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis. -- colossians 4:13
.
Luke the beloved physician and Demas salute you. -- colossians 4:14
.
Give my greetings to the brethren at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the assembly (the church) which meets in her house. -- colossians 4:15
.
And when this epistle has been read before you, [see] that it is read also in the assembly (the church) of the Laodiceans, and also [see] that you yourselves in turn read the [letter that comes to you] from Laodicea. -- colossians 4:16
.
And say to Archippus, See that you discharge carefully [the duties of] the ministry and fulfill the stewardship which you have received in the Lord. -- colossians 4:17
.
I, Paul, [add this final] greeting, writing with my own hand. Remember I am still in prison and in chains. May grace (God's unmerited favor and blessing) be with you! Amen (so be it). -- colossians 4:18
.
PAUL, SILVANUS (Silas), and Timothy, to the assembly (church) of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah): Grace (spiritual blessing and divine favor) to you and [heart] peace. -- 1 thessalonians 1:1
.
We are ever giving thanks to God for all of you, continually mentioning [you when engaged] in our prayers, -- 1 thessalonians 1:2
.
Recalling unceasingly before our God and Father your work energized by faith and service motivated by love and unwavering hope in [the return of] our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). [I Thess. 1:10.] -- 1 thessalonians 1:3
.
 brethren beloved by God, we recognize and know that He has selected (chosen) you; -- 1 thessalonians 1:4
.
For our [preaching of the] glad tidings (the Gospel) came to you not only in word, but also in [its own inherent] power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction and absolute certainty [on our part]. You know what kind of men we proved [ourselves] to be among you for your good. -- 1 thessalonians 1:5
.
And you [set yourselves to] become imitators of us and [through us] of the Lord Himself, for you welcomed our message in [spite of] much persecution, with joy [inspired] by the Holy Spirit; -- 1 thessalonians 1:6
.
So that you [thus] became a pattern to all the believers (those who adhere to, trust in, and rely on Christ Jesus) in Macedonia and Achaia (most of Greece). -- 1 thessalonians 1:7
.
For not only has the Word concerning and from the Lord resounded forth from you unmistakably in Macedonia and Achaia, but everywhere the report has gone forth of your faith in God [of your leaning of your whole personality on Him in complete trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness]. So we [find that we] never need to tell people anything [further about it]. -- 1 thessalonians 1:8
.
For they themselves volunteer testimony concerning us, telling what an entrance we had among you, and how you turned to God from [your] idols to serve a God Who is alive and true and genuine, -- 1 thessalonians 1:9
.
And [how you] look forward to and await the coming of His Son from heaven, Whom He raised from the dead--Jesus, Who personally rescues and delivers us out of and from the wrath [bringing punishment] which is coming [upon the impenitent] and draws us to Himself [investing us with all the privileges and rewards of the new life in Christ, the Messiah]. -- 1 thessalonians 1:10
.
FOR YOU yourselves know, brethren, that our coming among you was not useless and fruitless. -- 1 thessalonians 2:1
.
But though we had already suffered and been outrageously treated at Philippi, as you know, yet in [the strength of] our God we summoned courage to proclaim to you unfalteringly the good news (the Gospel) with earnest contention and much conflict and great opposition. -- 1 thessalonians 2:2
.
For our appeal [in preaching] does not [originate] from delusion or error or impure purpose or motive, nor in fraud or deceit. -- 1 thessalonians 2:3
.
But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the glad tidings (the Gospel), so we speak not to please men but to please God, Who tests our hearts [expecting them to be approved]. -- 1 thessalonians 2:4
.
For as you well know, we never resorted either to words of flattery or to any cloak to conceal greedy motives or pretexts for gain, [as] God is our witness. -- 1 thessalonians 2:5
.
Nor did we seek to extract praise and honor and glory from men, either from you or from anyone else, though we might have asserted our authority [stood on our dignity and claimed honor] as apostles (special missionaries) of Christ (the Messiah). -- 1 thessalonians 2:6
.
But we behaved gently when we were among you, like a devoted mother nursing and cherishing her own children. -- 1 thessalonians 2:7
.
So, being thus tenderly and affectionately desirous of you, we continued to share with you not only God's good news (the Gospel) but also our own lives as well, for you had become so very dear to us. -- 1 thessalonians 2:8
.
For you recall our hard toil and struggles, brethren. We worked night and day [and plied our trade] in order not to be a burden to any of you [for our support] while we proclaimed the glad tidings (the Gospel) of God to you. -- 1 thessalonians 2:9
.
You are witnesses, [yes] and God [also], how unworldly and upright and blameless was our behavior toward you believers [who adhered to and trusted in and relied on our Lord Jesus Christ]. -- 1 thessalonians 2:10
.
For you know how, as a father [dealing with] his children, we used to exhort each of you personally, stimulating and encouraging and charging you -- 1 thessalonians 2:11
.
To live lives worthy of God, Who calls you into His own kingdom and the glorious blessedness [into which true believers will enter after Christ's return]. -- 1 thessalonians 2:12
.
And we also [especially] thank God continually for this, that when you received the message of God [which you heard] from us, you welcomed it not as the word of [mere] men, but as it truly is, the Word of God, which is effectually at work in you who believe [exercising its superhuman power in those who adhere to and trust in and rely on it]. -- 1 thessalonians 2:13
.
For you, brethren, became imitators of the assemblies (churches) of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, for you too have suffered the same kind of treatment from your own fellow countrymen as they did [who were persecuted at the hands] of the Jews, -- 1 thessalonians 2:14
.
Who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and harassed and drove us out, and continue to make themselves hateful and offensive to God and to show themselves foes of all men, -- 1 thessalonians 2:15
.
Forbidding and hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles (the nations) that they may be saved. So as always they fill up [to the brim the measure of] their sins. But God's wrath has come upon them at last [completely and forever]! -- 1 thessalonians 2:16
.
But since we were bereft of you, brethren, for a little while in person, [of course] not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great longing to see you face to face, -- 1 thessalonians 2:17
.
Because it was our will to come to you. [I mean that] I, Paul, again and again [wanted to come], but Satan hindered and impeded us. -- 1 thessalonians 2:18
.
For what is our hope or happiness or our victor's wreath of exultant triumph when we stand in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? Is it not you? -- 1 thessalonians 2:19
.
For you are [indeed] our glory and our joy! -- 1 thessalonians 2:20
.
THEREFORE, WHEN [the suspense of separation and our yearning for some personal communication from you] became intolerable, we consented to being left behind alone at Athens. -- 1 thessalonians 3:1
.
And we sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in [spreading] the good news (the Gospel) of Christ, to strengthen and establish and to exhort and comfort and encourage you in your faith, -- 1 thessalonians 3:2
.
That no one [of you] should be disturbed and beguiled and led astray by these afflictions and difficulties [to which I have referred]. For you yourselves know that this is [unavoidable in our position, and must be recognized as] our appointed lot. -- 1 thessalonians 3:3
.
For even when we were with you, [you know] we warned you plainly beforehand that we were to be pressed with difficulties and made to suffer affliction, just as to your own knowledge it has [since] happened. -- 1 thessalonians 3:4
.
That is the reason that, when I could bear [the suspense] no longer, I sent that I might learn [how you were standing the strain, and the endurance of] your faith, [for I was fearful] lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our toil [among you should prove to] be fruitless and to no purpose. -- 1 thessalonians 3:5
.
But now that Timothy has just come back to us from [his visit to] you and has brought us the good news of [the steadfastness of] your faith and [the warmth of your] love, and [reported] how kindly you cherish a constant and affectionate remembrance of us [and that you are] longing to see us as we [are to see] you, -- 1 thessalonians 3:6
.
Brethren, for this reason, in [spite of all] our stress and crushing difficulties we have been filled with comfort and cheer about you [because of] your faith (the leaning of your whole personality on God in complete trust and confidence). -- 1 thessalonians 3:7
.
Because now we [really] live, if you stand [firm] in the Lord. -- 1 thessalonians 3:8
.
For what [adequate] thanksgiving can we render to God for you for all the gladness and delight which we enjoy for your sakes before our God? -- 1 thessalonians 3:9
.
[And we] continue to pray especially and with most intense earnestness night and day that we may see you face to face and mend and make good whatever may be imperfect and lacking in your faith. -- 1 thessalonians 3:10
.
Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) guide our steps to you. -- 1 thessalonians 3:11
.
And may the Lord make you to increase and excel and overflow in love for one another and for all people, just as we also do for you, -- 1 thessalonians 3:12
.
So that He may strengthen and confirm and establish your hearts faultlessly pure and unblamable in holiness in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) with all His saints (the holy and glorified people of God)! Amen, (so be it)! -- 1 thessalonians 3:13
.
FURTHERMORE, BRETHREN, we beg and admonish you in [virtue of our union with] the Lord Jesus, that [you follow the instructions which] you learned from us about how you ought to walk so as to please and gratify God, as indeed you are doing, [and] that you do so even more and more abundantly [attaining yet greater perfection in living this life]. -- 1 thessalonians 4:1
.
For you know what charges and precepts we gave you [on the authority and by the inspiration of] the Lord Jesus. -- 1 thessalonians 4:2
.
For this is the will of God, that you should be consecrated (separated and set apart for pure and holy living): that you should abstain and shrink from all sexual vice, -- 1 thessalonians 4:3
.
That each one of you should know how to possess (control, manage) his own body in consecration (purity, separated from things profane) and honor, -- 1 thessalonians 4:4
.
Not [to be used] in the passion of lust like the heathen, who are ignorant of the true God and have no knowledge of His will, -- 1 thessalonians 4:5
.
That no man transgress and overreach his brother and defraud him in this matter or defraud his brother in business. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we have already warned you solemnly and told you plainly. -- 1 thessalonians 4:6
.
For God has not called us to impurity but to consecration [to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity]. -- 1 thessalonians 4:7
.
Therefore whoever disregards (sets aside and rejects this) disregards not man but God, Whose [very] Spirit [Whom] He gives to you is holy (chaste, pure). -- 1 thessalonians 4:8
.
But concerning brotherly love [for all other Christians], you have no need to have anyone write you, for you yourselves have been [personally] taught by God to love one another. -- 1 thessalonians 4:9
.
And indeed you already are [extending and displaying your love] to all the brethren throughout Macedonia. But we beseech and earnestly exhort you, brethren, that you excel [in this matter] more and more, -- 1 thessalonians 4:10
.
To make it your ambition and definitely endeavor to live quietly and peacefully, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we charged you, -- 1 thessalonians 4:11
.
So that you may bear yourselves becomingly and be correct and honorable and command the respect of the outside world, being dependent on nobody [self-supporting] and having need of nothing. -- 1 thessalonians 4:12
.
Now also we would not have you ignorant, brethren, about those who fall asleep [in death], that you may not grieve [for them] as the rest do who have no hope [beyond the grave]. -- 1 thessalonians 4:13
.
For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will also bring with Him through Jesus those who have fallen asleep [in death]. -- 1 thessalonians 4:14
.
For this we declare to you by the Lord's [own] word, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede [into His presence] or have any advantage at all over those who have previously fallen asleep [in Him in death]. -- 1 thessalonians 4:15
.
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud cry of summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the blast of the trumpet of God. And those who have departed this life in Christ will rise first. -- 1 thessalonians 4:16
.
Then we, the living ones who remain [on the earth], shall simultaneously be caught up along with [the resurrected dead] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so always (through the eternity of the eternities) we shall be with the Lord! -- 1 thessalonians 4:17
.
Therefore comfort and encourage one another with these words. -- 1 thessalonians 4:18
.
BUT AS to the suitable times and the precise seasons and dates, brethren, you have no necessity for anything being written to you. -- 1 thessalonians 5:1
.
For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the [return of the] Lord will come [as unexpectedly and suddenly] as a thief in the night. -- 1 thessalonians 5:2
.
When people are saying, All is well and secure, and, There is peace and safety, then in a moment unforeseen destruction (ruin and death) will come upon them as suddenly as labor pains come upon a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape, for there will be no escape. -- 1 thessalonians 5:3
.
But you are not in [given up to the power of] darkness, brethren, for that day to overtake you by surprise like a thief. -- 1 thessalonians 5:4
.
For you are all sons of light and sons of the day; we do not belong either to the night or to darkness. -- 1 thessalonians 5:5
.
Accordingly then, let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us keep wide awake (alert, watchful, cautious, and on our guard) and let us be sober (calm, collected, and circumspect). -- 1 thessalonians 5:6
.
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night. -- 1 thessalonians 5:7
.
But we belong to the day; therefore, let us be sober and put on the breastplate (corslet) of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation. -- 1 thessalonians 5:8
.
For God has not appointed us to [incur His] wrath [He did not select us to condemn us], but [that we might] obtain [His] salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) -- 1 thessalonians 5:9
.
Who died for us so that whether we are still alive or are dead [at Christ's appearing], we might live together with Him and share His life. -- 1 thessalonians 5:10
.
Therefore encourage (admonish, exhort) one another and edify (strengthen and build up) one another, just as you are doing. -- 1 thessalonians 5:11
.
Now also we beseech you, brethren, get to know those who labor among you [recognize them for what they are, acknowledge and appreciate and respect them all]--your leaders who are over you in the Lord and those who warn and kindly reprove and exhort you. -- 1 thessalonians 5:12
.
And hold them in very high and most affectionate esteem in [intelligent and sympathetic] appreciation of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. -- 1 thessalonians 5:13
.
And we earnestly beseech you, brethren, admonish (warn and seriously advise) those who are out of line [the loafers, the disorderly, and the unruly]; encourage the timid and fainthearted, help and give your support to the weak souls, [and] be very patient with everybody [always keeping your temper]. -- 1 thessalonians 5:14
.
See that none of you repays another with evil for evil, but always aim to show kindness and seek to do good to one another and to everybody. -- 1 thessalonians 5:15
.
Be happy [in your faith] and rejoice and be glad-hearted continually (always); -- 1 thessalonians 5:16
.
Be unceasing in prayer [praying perseveringly]; -- 1 thessalonians 5:17
.
Thank [God] in everything [no matter what the circumstances may be, be thankful and give thanks], for this is the will of God for you [who are] in Christ Jesus [the Revealer and Mediator of that will]. -- 1 thessalonians 5:18
.
Do not quench (suppress or subdue) the [Holy] Spirit; -- 1 thessalonians 5:19
.
Do not spurn the gifts and utterances of the prophets [do not depreciate prophetic revelations nor despise inspired instruction or exhortation or warning]. -- 1 thessalonians 5:20
.
But test and prove all things [until you can recognize] what is good; [to that] hold fast. -- 1 thessalonians 5:21
.
Abstain from evil [shrink from it and keep aloof from it] in whatever form or whatever kind it may be. -- 1 thessalonians 5:22
.
And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you through and through [separate you from profane things, make you pure and wholly consecrated to God]; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved sound and complete [and found] blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- 1 thessalonians 5:23
.
Faithful is He Who is calling you [to Himself] and utterly trustworthy, and He will also do it [fulfill His call by hallowing and keeping you]. -- 1 thessalonians 5:24
.
Brethren, pray for us. -- 1 thessalonians 5:25
.
Greet all the brethren with a sacred kiss. -- 1 thessalonians 5:26
.
I solemnly charge you [in the name of] the Lord to have this letter read before all the brethren. -- 1 thessalonians 5:27
.
The grace (the unmerited favor and blessings) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen, (so be it). -- 1 thessalonians 5:28
.
PAUL, SILVANUS (Silas), and Timothy, to the church (assembly) of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One): -- 2 thessalonians 1:1
.
Grace (unmerited favor) be to you and [heart] peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- 2 thessalonians 1:2
.
We ought and indeed are obligated [as those in debt] to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as is fitting, because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of every one of you each toward the others is increasing and abounds. -- 2 thessalonians 1:3
.
And this is a cause of our mentioning you with pride among the churches (assemblies) of God for your steadfastness (your unflinching endurance and patience) and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecutions and crushing distresses and afflictions under which you are holding up. -- 2 thessalonians 1:4
.
This is positive proof of the just and right judgment of God to the end that you may be deemed deserving of His kingdom [a plain token of His fair verdict which designs that you should be made and counted worthy of the kingdom of God], for the sake of which you are also suffering. -- 2 thessalonians 1:5
.
[It is a fair decision] since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with distress and affliction those who distress and afflict you, -- 2 thessalonians 1:6
.
And to [recompense] you who are so distressed and afflicted [by granting you] relief and rest along with us [your fellow sufferers] when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire, -- 2 thessalonians 1:7
.
To deal out retribution (chastisement and vengeance) upon those who do not know or perceive or become acquainted with God, and [upon those] who ignore and refuse to obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 1:8
.
Such people will pay the penalty and suffer the punishment of everlasting ruin (destruction and perdition) and eternal exclusion and banishment from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, -- 2 thessalonians 1:9
.
When He comes to be glorified in His saints [on that day He will be made more glorious in His consecrated people], and [He will] be marveled at and admired [in His glory reflected] in all who have believed [who have adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Him], because our witnessing among you was confidently accepted and believed [and confirmed in your lives]. -- 2 thessalonians 1:10
.
With this in view we constantly pray for you, that our God may deem and count you worthy of [your] calling and [His] every gracious purpose of goodness, and with power may complete in [your] every particular work of faith (faith which is that leaning of the whole human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness). -- 2 thessalonians 1:11
.
Thus may the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified and become more glorious through and in you, and may you [also be glorified] in Him according to the grace (favor and blessing) of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- 2 thessalonians 1:12
.
BUT RELATIVE to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and our gathering together to [meet] Him, we beg you, brethren, -- 2 thessalonians 2:1
.
Not to allow your minds to be quickly unsettled or disturbed or kept excited or alarmed, whether it be by some [pretended] revelation of [the] Spirit or by word or by letter [alleged to be] from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has [already] arrived and is here. -- 2 thessalonians 2:2
.
Let no one deceive or beguile you in any way, for that day will not come except the apostasy comes first [unless the predicted great falling away of those who have professed to be Christians has come], and the man of lawlessness (sin) is revealed, who is the son of doom (of perdition), -- 2 thessalonians 2:3
.
Who opposes and exalts himself so proudly and insolently against and over all that is called God or that is worshiped, [even to his actually] taking his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming that he himself is God. -- 2 thessalonians 2:4
.
Do you not recollect that when I was still with you, I told you these things? -- 2 thessalonians 2:5
.
And now you know what is restraining him [from being revealed at this time]; it is so that he may be manifested (revealed) in his own [appointed] time. -- 2 thessalonians 2:6
.
For the mystery of lawlessness (that hidden principle of rebellion against constituted authority) is already at work in the world, [but it is] restrained only until he who restrains is taken out of the way. -- 2 thessalonians 2:7
.
And then the lawless one (the antichrist) will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by His appearing at His coming. -- 2 thessalonians 2:8
.
The coming [of the lawless one, the antichrist] is through the activity and working of Satan and will be attended by great power and with all sorts of [pretended] miracles and signs and delusive marvels--[all of them] lying wonders-- -- 2 thessalonians 2:9
.
And by unlimited seduction to evil and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing (going to perdition) because they did not welcome the Truth but refused to love it that they might be saved. -- 2 thessalonians 2:10
.
Therefore God sends upon them a misleading influence, a working of error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false, -- 2 thessalonians 2:11
.
In order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe in [who refused to adhere to, trust in, and rely on] the Truth, but [instead] took pleasure in unrighteousness. -- 2 thessalonians 2:12
.
But we, brethren beloved by the Lord, ought and are obligated [as those who are in debt] to give thanks always to God for you, because God chose you from the beginning as His firstfruits (first converts) for salvation through the sanctifying work of the [Holy] Spirit and [your] belief in (adherence to, trust in, and reliance on) the Truth. -- 2 thessalonians 2:13
.
[It was] to this end that He called you through our Gospel, so that you may obtain and share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- 2 thessalonians 2:14
.
So then, brethren, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions and instructions which you were taught by us, whether by our word of mouth or by letter. -- 2 thessalonians 2:15
.
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, Who loved us and gave us everlasting consolation and encouragement and well-founded hope through [His] grace (unmerited favor), -- 2 thessalonians 2:16
.
Comfort and encourage your hearts and strengthen them [make them steadfast and keep them unswerving] in every good work and word. -- 2 thessalonians 2:17
.
FURTHERMORE, BRETHREN, do pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may speed on (spread rapidly and run its course) and be glorified (extolled) and triumph, even as [it has done] with you, -- 2 thessalonians 3:1
.
And that we may be delivered from perverse (improper, unrighteous) and wicked (actively malicious) men, for not everybody has faith and is held by it. -- 2 thessalonians 3:2
.
Yet the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen [you] and set you on a firm foundation and guard you from the evil [one]. -- 2 thessalonians 3:3
.
And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we suggest and with which we charge you. -- 2 thessalonians 3:4
.
May the Lord direct your hearts into [realizing and showing] the love of God and into the steadfastness and patience of Christ and in waiting for His return. -- 2 thessalonians 3:5
.
Now we charge you, brethren, in the name and on the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that you withdraw and keep away from every brother (fellow believer) who is slack in the performance of duty and is disorderly, living as a shirker and not walking in accord with the traditions and instructions that you have received from us. -- 2 thessalonians 3:6
.
For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate our example, for we were not disorderly or shirking of duty when we were with you [we were not idle]. -- 2 thessalonians 3:7
.
Nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and struggle we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden or impose on any of you [for our support]. -- 2 thessalonians 3:8
.
[It was] not because we do not have a right [to such support], but [we wished] to make ourselves an example for you to follow. -- 2 thessalonians 3:9
.
For while we were yet with you, we gave you this rule and charge: If anyone will not work, neither let him eat. -- 2 thessalonians 3:10
.
Indeed, we hear that some among you are disorderly [that they are passing their lives in idleness, neglectful of duty], being busy with other people's affairs instead of their own and doing no work. -- 2 thessalonians 3:11
.
Now we charge and exhort such persons [as ministers in Him exhorting those] in the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that they work in quietness and earn their own food and other necessities. -- 2 thessalonians 3:12
.
And as for you, brethren, do not become weary or lose heart in doing right [but continue in well-doing without weakening]. -- 2 thessalonians 3:13
.
But if anyone [in the church] refuses to obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed. -- 2 thessalonians 3:14
.
Do not regard him as an enemy, but simply admonish and warn him as [being still] a brother. -- 2 thessalonians 3:15
.
Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace (the peace of His kingdom) at all times and in all ways [under all circumstances and conditions, whatever comes]. The Lord [be] with you all. -- 2 thessalonians 3:16
.
I, Paul, write you this final greeting with my own hand. This is the mark and sign [that it is not a forgery] in every letter of mine. It is the way I write [my handwriting and signature]. -- 2 thessalonians 3:17
.
The grace (spiritual blessing and favor) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it). -- 2 thessalonians 3:18
.
PAUL, AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus by appointment and command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), our Hope, -- 1 timothy 1:1
.
To Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace (spiritual blessing and favor), mercy, and [heart] peace [be yours] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. -- 1 timothy 1:2
.
As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia, stay on where you are at Ephesus in order that you may warn and admonish and charge certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine, -- 1 timothy 1:3
.
Nor to give importance to or occupy themselves with legends (fables, myths) and endless genealogies, which foster and promote useless speculations and questionings rather than acceptance in faith of God's administration and the divine training that is in faith (in that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence)-- -- 1 timothy 1:4
.
Whereas the object and purpose of our instruction and charge is love, which springs from a pure heart and a good (clear) conscience and sincere (unfeigned) faith. -- 1 timothy 1:5
.
But certain individuals have missed the mark on this very matter [and] have wandered away into vain arguments and discussions and purposeless talk. -- 1 timothy 1:6
.
They are ambitious to be doctors of the Law (teachers of the Mosaic ritual), but they have no understanding either of the words and terms they use or of the subjects about which they make [such] dogmatic assertions. -- 1 timothy 1:7
.
Now we recognize and know that the Law is good if anyone uses it lawfully [for the purpose for which it was designed], -- 1 timothy 1:8
.
Knowing and understanding this: that the Law is not enacted for the righteous (the upright and just, who are in right standing with God), but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinful, for the irreverent and profane, for those who strike and beat and [even] murder fathers and strike and beat and [even] murder mothers, for manslayers, -- 1 timothy 1:9
.
[For] impure and immoral persons, those who abuse themselves with men, kidnapers, liars, perjurers--and whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching and sound doctrine -- 1 timothy 1:10
.
As laid down by the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted. -- 1 timothy 1:11
.
I give thanks to Him Who has granted me [the needed] strength and made me able [for this], Christ Jesus our Lord, because He has judged and counted me faithful and trustworthy, appointing me to [this stewardship of] the ministry. -- 1 timothy 1:12
.
Though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and was shamefully and outrageously and aggressively insulting [to Him], nevertheless, I obtained mercy because I had acted out of ignorance in unbelief. -- 1 timothy 1:13
.
And the grace (unmerited favor and blessing) of our Lord [actually] flowed out superabundantly and beyond measure for me, accompanied by faith and love that are [to be realized] in Christ Jesus. -- 1 timothy 1:14
.
The saying is sure and true and worthy of full and universal acceptance, that Christ Jesus (the Messiah) came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost. -- 1 timothy 1:15
.
But I obtained mercy for the reason that in me, as the foremost [of sinners], Jesus Christ might show forth and display all His perfect long-suffering and patience for an example to [encourage] those who would thereafter believe on Him for [the gaining of] eternal life. -- 1 timothy 1:16
.
Now to the King of eternity, incorruptible and immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever (to the ages of ages). Amen (so be it). -- 1 timothy 1:17
.
This charge and admonition I commit in trust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with prophetic intimations which I formerly received concerning you, so that inspired and aided by them you may wage the good warfare, -- 1 timothy 1:18
.
Holding fast to faith (that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence) and having a good (clear) conscience. By rejecting and thrusting from them [their conscience], some individuals have made shipwreck of their faith. -- 1 timothy 1:19
.
Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan in order that they may be disciplined [by punishment and learn] not to blaspheme. -- 1 timothy 1:20
.
FIRST OF all, then, I admonish and urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men, -- 1 timothy 2:1
.
For kings and all who are in positions of authority or high responsibility, that [outwardly] we may pass a quiet and undisturbed life [and inwardly] a peaceable one in all godliness and reverence and seriousness in every way. -- 1 timothy 2:2
.
For such [praying] is good and right, and [it is] pleasing and acceptable to God our Savior, -- 1 timothy 2:3
.
Who wishes all men to be saved and [increasingly] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [divine] Truth. -- 1 timothy 2:4
.
For there [is only] one God, and [only] one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, -- 1 timothy 2:5
.
Who gave Himself as a ransom for all [people, a fact that was] attested to at the right and proper time. -- 1 timothy 2:6
.
And of this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (special messenger)--I am speaking the truth in Christ, I do not falsify [when I say this]--a teacher of the Gentiles in [the realm of] faith and truth. -- 1 timothy 2:7
.
I desire therefore that in every place men should pray, without anger or quarreling or resentment or doubt [in their minds], lifting up holy hands. -- 1 timothy 2:8
.
Also [I desire] that women should adorn themselves modestly and appropriately and sensibly in seemly apparel, not with [elaborate] hair arrangement or gold or pearls or expensive clothing, -- 1 timothy 2:9
.
But by doing good deeds (deeds in themselves good and for the good and advantage of those contacted by them), as befits women who profess reverential fear for and devotion to God. -- 1 timothy 2:10
.
Let a woman learn in quietness, in entire submissiveness. -- 1 timothy 2:11
.
I allow no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to remain in quietness and keep silence [in religious assemblies]. -- 1 timothy 2:12
.
For Adam was first formed, then Eve; -- 1 timothy 2:13
.
And it was not Adam who was deceived, but [the] woman who was deceived and deluded and fell into transgression. -- 1 timothy 2:14
.
Nevertheless [the sentence put upon women of pain in motherhood does not hinder their souls' salvation, and] they will be saved [eternally] if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control, [saved indeed] through the Childbearing or by the birth of the divine Child. -- 1 timothy 2:15
.
THE SAYING is true and irrefutable: If any man [eagerly] seeks the office of bishop (superintendent, overseer), he desires an excellent task (work). -- 1 timothy 3:1
.
Now a bishop (superintendent, overseer) must give no grounds for accusation but must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, circumspect and temperate and self-controlled; [he must be] sensible and well behaved and dignified and lead an orderly (disciplined) life; [he must be] hospitable [showing love for and being a friend to the believers, especially strangers or foreigners, and be] a capable and qualified teacher, -- 1 timothy 3:2
.
Not given to wine, not combative but gentle and considerate, not quarrelsome but forbearing and peaceable, and not a lover of money [insatiable for wealth and ready to obtain it by questionable means]. -- 1 timothy 3:3
.
He must rule his own household well, keeping his children under control, with true dignity, commanding their respect in every way and keeping them respectful. -- 1 timothy 3:4
.
For if a man does not know how to rule his own household, how is he to take care of the church of God? -- 1 timothy 3:5
.
He must not be a new convert, or he may [develop a beclouded and stupid state of mind] as the result of pride [be blinded by conceit, and] fall into the condemnation that the devil [once] did. -- 1 timothy 3:6
.
Furthermore, he must have a good reputation and be well thought of by those outside [the church], lest he become involved in slander and incur reproach and fall into the devil's trap. -- 1 timothy 3:7
.
In like manner the deacons [must be] worthy of respect, not shifty and double-talkers but sincere in what they say, not given to much wine, not greedy for base gain [craving wealth and resorting to ignoble and dishonest methods of getting it]. -- 1 timothy 3:8
.
They must possess the mystic secret of the faith [Christian truth as hidden from ungodly men] with a clear conscience. -- 1 timothy 3:9
.
And let them also be tried and investigated and proved first; then, if they turn out to be above reproach, let them serve [as deacons]. -- 1 timothy 3:10
.
[The] women likewise must be worthy of respect and serious, not gossipers, but temperate and self-controlled, [thoroughly] trustworthy in all things. -- 1 timothy 3:11
.
Let deacons be the husbands of but one wife, and let them manage [their] children and their own households well. -- 1 timothy 3:12
.
For those who perform well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and also gain much confidence and freedom and boldness in the faith which is [founded on and centers] in Christ Jesus. -- 1 timothy 3:13
.
Although I hope to come to you before long, I am writing these instructions to you so that, -- 1 timothy 3:14
.
If I am detained, you may know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and stay (the prop and support) of the Truth. -- 1 timothy 3:15
.
And great and important and weighty, we confess, is the hidden truth (the mystic secret) of godliness. He [God] was made visible in human flesh, justified and vindicated in the [Holy] Spirit, was seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, [and] taken up in glory. -- 1 timothy 3:16
.
BUT THE [Holy] Spirit distinctly and expressly declares that in latter times some will turn away from the faith, giving attention to deluding and seducing spirits and doctrines that demons teach, -- 1 timothy 4:1
.
Through the hypocrisy and pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared (cauterized), -- 1 timothy 4:2
.
Who forbid people to marry and [teach them] to abstain from [certain kinds of] foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and have [an increasingly clear] knowledge of the truth. -- 1 timothy 4:3
.
For everything God has created is good, and nothing is to be thrown away or refused if it is received with thanksgiving. -- 1 timothy 4:4
.
For it is hallowed and consecrated by the Word of God and by prayer. -- 1 timothy 4:5
.
If you lay all these instructions before the brethren, you will be a worthy steward and a good minister of Christ Jesus, ever nourishing your own self on the truths of the faith and of the good [Christian] instruction which you have closely followed. -- 1 timothy 4:6
.
But refuse and avoid irreverent legends (profane and impure and godless fictions, mere grandmothers' tales) and silly myths, and express your disapproval of them. Train yourself toward godliness (piety), [keeping yourself spiritually fit]. -- 1 timothy 4:7
.
For physical training is of some value (useful for a little), but godliness (spiritual training) is useful and of value in everything and in every way, for it holds promise for the present life and also for the life which is to come. -- 1 timothy 4:8
.
This saying is reliable and worthy of complete acceptance by everybody. -- 1 timothy 4:9
.
With a view to this we toil and strive, [yes and] suffer reproach, because we have [fixed our] hope on the living God, Who is the Savior (Preserver, Maintainer, Deliverer) of all men, especially of those who believe (trust in, rely on, and adhere to Him). -- 1 timothy 4:10
.
Continue to command these things and to teach them. -- 1 timothy 4:11
.
Let no one despise or think less of you because of your youth, but be an example (pattern) for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity. -- 1 timothy 4:12
.
Till I come, devote yourself to [public and private] reading, to exhortation (preaching and personal appeals), and to teaching and instilling doctrine. -- 1 timothy 4:13
.
Do not neglect the gift which is in you, [that special inward endowment] which was directly imparted to you [by the Holy Spirit] by prophetic utterance when the elders laid their hands upon you [at your ordination]. -- 1 timothy 4:14
.
Practice and cultivate and meditate upon these duties; throw yourself wholly into them [as your ministry], so that your progress may be evident to everybody. -- 1 timothy 4:15
.
Look well to yourself [to your own personality] and to [your] teaching; persevere in these things [hold to them], for by so doing you will save both yourself and those who hear you. -- 1 timothy 4:16
.
DO NOT sharply censure or rebuke an older man, but entreat and plead with him as [you would with] a father. Treat younger men like brothers; -- 1 timothy 5:1
.
[Treat] older women like mothers [and] younger women like sisters, in all purity. -- 1 timothy 5:2
.
[Always] treat with great consideration and give aid to those who are truly widowed (solitary and without support). -- 1 timothy 5:3
.
But if a widow has children or grandchildren, see to it that these are first made to understand that it is their religious duty [to defray their natural obligation to those] at home, and make return to their parents or grandparents [for all their care by contributing to their maintenance], for this is acceptable in the sight of God. -- 1 timothy 5:4
.
Now [a woman] who is a real widow and is left entirely alone and desolate has fixed her hope on God and perseveres in supplications and prayers night and day, -- 1 timothy 5:5
.
Whereas she who lives in pleasure and self-gratification [giving herself up to luxury and self-indulgence] is dead even while she [still] lives. -- 1 timothy 5:6
.
Charge [the people] thus, so that they may be without reproach and blameless. -- 1 timothy 5:7
.
If anyone fails to provide for his relatives, and especially for those of his own family, he has disowned the faith [by failing to accompany it with fruits] and is worse than an unbeliever [who performs his obligation in these matters]. -- 1 timothy 5:8
.
Let no one be put on the roll of widows [who are to receive church support] who is under sixty years of age or who has been the wife of more than one man; -- 1 timothy 5:9
.
And she must have a reputation for good deeds, as one who has brought up children, who has practiced hospitality to strangers [of the brotherhood], washed the feet of the saints, helped to relieve the distressed, [and] devoted herself diligently to doing good in every way. -- 1 timothy 5:10
.
But refuse [to enroll on this list the] younger widows, for when they become restive and their natural desires grow strong, they withdraw themselves against Christ [and] wish to marry [again]. -- 1 timothy 5:11
.
And so they incur condemnation for having set aside and slighted their previous pledge. -- 1 timothy 5:12
.
Moreover, as they go about from house to house, they learn to be idlers, and not only idlers, but gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not say and talking of things they should not mention. -- 1 timothy 5:13
.
So I would have younger [widows] marry, bear children, guide the household, [and] not give opponents of the faith occasion for slander or reproach. -- 1 timothy 5:14
.
For already some [widows] have turned aside after Satan. -- 1 timothy 5:15
.
If any believing woman or believing man has [relatives or persons in the household who are] widows, let him relieve them; let the church not be burdened [with them], so that it may [be free to] assist those who are truly widows (those who are all alone and are dependent). -- 1 timothy 5:16
.
Let the elders who perform the duties of their office well be considered doubly worthy of honor [and of adequate financial support], especially those who labor faithfully in preaching and teaching. -- 1 timothy 5:17
.
For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain, and again, The laborer is worthy of his hire. -- 1 timothy 5:18
.
Listen to no accusation [presented before a judge] against an elder unless it is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses. -- 1 timothy 5:19
.
As for those who are guilty and persist in sin, rebuke and admonish them in the presence of all, so that the rest may be warned and stand in wholesome awe and fear. -- 1 timothy 5:20
.
I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the chosen angels that you guard and keep [these rules] without personal prejudice or favor, doing nothing from partiality. -- 1 timothy 5:21
.
Do not be in a hurry in the laying on of hands [giving the sanction of the church too hastily in reinstating expelled offenders or in ordination in questionable cases], nor share or participate in another man's sins; keep yourself pure. -- 1 timothy 5:22
.
Drink water no longer exclusively, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. -- 1 timothy 5:23
.
The sins of some men are conspicuous (openly evident to all eyes), going before them to the judgment [seat] and proclaiming their sentence in advance; but the sins of others appear later [following the offender to the bar of judgment and coming into view there]. -- 1 timothy 5:24
.
So also, good deeds are evident and conspicuous, and even when they are not, they cannot remain hidden [indefinitely]. -- 1 timothy 5:25
.
LET ALL who are under the yoke as bond servants esteem their own [personal] masters worthy of honor and fullest respect, so that the name of God and the teaching [about Him] may not be brought into disrepute and blasphemed. -- 1 timothy 6:1
.
Let those who have believing masters not be disrespectful or scornful [to them] on the grounds that they are brothers [in Christ]; rather, they should serve [them all the better] because those who benefit by their kindly service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these duties. -- 1 timothy 6:2
.
But if anyone teaches otherwise and does not assent to the sound and wholesome messages of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and the teaching which is in agreement with godliness (piety toward God), -- 1 timothy 6:3
.
He is puffed up with pride and stupefied with conceit, [although he is] woefully ignorant. He has a morbid fondness for controversy and disputes and strife about words, which result in (produce) envy and jealousy, quarrels and dissension, abuse and insults and slander, and base suspicions, -- 1 timothy 6:4
.
And protracted wrangling and wearing discussion and perpetual friction among men who are corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, who imagine that godliness or righteousness is a source of profit [a moneymaking business, a means of livelihood]. From such withdraw. -- 1 timothy 6:5
.
[And it is, indeed, a source of immense profit, for] godliness accompanied with contentment (that contentment which is a sense of inward sufficiency) is great and abundant gain. -- 1 timothy 6:6
.
For we brought nothing into the world, and obviously we cannot take anything out of the world; -- 1 timothy 6:7
.
But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content (satisfied). -- 1 timothy 6:8
.
But those who crave to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish (useless, godless) and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction and miserable perishing. -- 1 timothy 6:9
.
For the love of money is a root of all evils; it is through this craving that some have been led astray and have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves through with many acute [mental] pangs. -- 1 timothy 6:10
.
But as for you, O man of God, flee from all these things; aim at and pursue righteousness (right standing with God and true goodness), godliness (which is the loving fear of God and being Christlike), faith, love, steadfastness (patience), and gentleness of heart. -- 1 timothy 6:11
.
Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold of the eternal life to which you were summoned and [for which] you confessed the good confession [of faith] before many witnesses. -- 1 timothy 6:12
.
In the presence of God, Who preserves alive all living things, and of Christ Jesus, Who in His testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I [solemnly] charge you -- 1 timothy 6:13
.
To keep all His precepts unsullied and flawless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One), -- 1 timothy 6:14
.
Which [appearing] will be shown forth in His own proper time by the blessed, only Sovereign (Ruler), the King of kings and the Lord of lords, -- 1 timothy 6:15
.
Who alone has immortality [in the sense of exemption from every kind of death] and lives in unapproachable light, Whom no man has ever seen or can see. Unto Him be honor and everlasting power and dominion. Amen (so be it). -- 1 timothy 6:16
.
As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be proud and arrogant and contemptuous of others, nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches, but on God, Who richly and ceaselessly provides us with everything for [our] enjoyment. -- 1 timothy 6:17
.
[Charge them] to do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal and generous of heart, ready to share [with others], -- 1 timothy 6:18
.
In this way laying up for themselves [the riches that endure forever as] a good foundation for the future, so that they may grasp that which is life indeed. -- 1 timothy 6:19
.
O Timothy, guard and keep the deposit entrusted [to you]! Turn away from the irreverent babble and godless chatter, with the vain and empty and worldly phrases, and the subtleties and the contradictions in what is falsely called knowledge and spiritual illumination. -- 1 timothy 6:20
.
[For] by making such profession some have erred (missed the mark) as regards the faith. Grace (divine favor and blessing) be with you all! Amen (so be it). -- 1 timothy 6:21
.
PAUL, AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, -- 2 timothy 1:1
.
To Timothy, [my] beloved child: Grace (favor and spiritual blessing), mercy, and [heart] peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord! -- 2 timothy 1:2
.
I thank God Whom I worship with a pure conscience, in the spirit of my fathers, when without ceasing I remember you night and day in my prayers, -- 2 timothy 1:3
.
And when, as I recall your tears, I yearn to see you so that I may be filled with joy. -- 2 timothy 1:4
.
I am calling up memories of your sincere and unqualified faith (the leaning of your entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness), [a faith] that first lived permanently in [the heart of] your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am [fully] persuaded, [dwells] in you also. -- 2 timothy 1:5
.
That is why I would remind you to stir up (rekindle the embers of, fan the flame of, and keep burning) the [gracious] gift of God, [the inner fire] that is in you by means of the laying on of my hands [with those of the elders at your ordination]. -- 2 timothy 1:6
.
For God did not give us a spirit of timidity (of cowardice, of craven and cringing and fawning fear), but [He has given us a spirit] of power and of love and of calm and well-balanced mind and discipline and self-control. -- 2 timothy 1:7
.
Do not blush or be ashamed then, to testify to and for our Lord, nor of me, a prisoner for His sake, but [with me] take your share of the suffering [to which the preaching] of the Gospel [may expose you, and do it] in the power of God. -- 2 timothy 1:8
.
[For it is He] Who delivered and saved us and called us with a calling in itself holy and leading to holiness [to a life of consecration, a vocation of holiness]; [He did it] not because of anything of merit that we have done, but because of and to further His own purpose and grace (unmerited favor) which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began [eternal ages ago]. -- 2 timothy 1:9
.
[It is that purpose and grace] which He now has made known and has fully disclosed and made real [to us] through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, Who annulled death and made it of no effect and brought life and immortality (immunity from eternal death) to light through the Gospel. -- 2 timothy 1:10
.
For [the proclaiming of] this [Gospel] I was appointed a herald (preacher) and an apostle (special messenger) and a teacher of the Gentiles. -- 2 timothy 1:11
.
And this is why I am suffering as I do. Still I am not ashamed, for I know (perceive, have knowledge of, and am acquainted with) Him Whom I have believed (adhered to and trusted in and relied on), and I am [positively] persuaded that He is able to guard and keep that which has been entrusted to me and which I have committed [to Him] until that day. -- 2 timothy 1:12
.
Hold fast and follow the pattern of wholesome and sound teaching which you have heard from me, in [all] the faith and love which are [for us] in Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 1:13
.
Guard and keep [with the greatest care] the precious and excellently adapted [Truth] which has been entrusted [to you], by the [help of the] Holy Spirit Who makes His home in us. -- 2 timothy 1:14
.
You already know that all who are in Asia turned away and forsook me, Phygelus and Hermogenes among them. -- 2 timothy 1:15
.
May the Lord grant [His] mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, for he often showed me kindness and ministered to my needs [comforting and reviving and bracing me like fresh air]! He was not ashamed of my chains and imprisonment [for Christ's sake]. -- 2 timothy 1:16
.
No, rather when he reached Rome, he searched diligently and eagerly for me and found me. -- 2 timothy 1:17
.
May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord on that [great] day! And you know how many things he did for me and what a help he was at Ephesus [you know better than I can tell you]. -- 2 timothy 1:18
.
SO YOU, my son, be strong (strengthened inwardly) in the grace (spiritual blessing) that is [to be found only] in Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 2:1
.
And the [instructions] which you have heard from me along with many witnesses, transmit and entrust [as a deposit] to reliable and faithful men who will be competent and qualified to teach others also. -- 2 timothy 2:2
.
Take [with me] your share of the hardships and suffering [which you are called to endure] as a good (first-class) soldier of Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 2:3
.
No soldier when in service gets entangled in the enterprises of [civilian] life; his aim is to satisfy and please the one who enlisted him. -- 2 timothy 2:4
.
And if anyone enters competitive games, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully (fairly, according to the rules laid down). -- 2 timothy 2:5
.
[It is] the hard-working farmer [who labors to produce] who must be the first partaker of the fruits. -- 2 timothy 2:6
.
Think over these things I am saying [understand them and grasp their application], for the Lord will grant you full insight and understanding in everything. -- 2 timothy 2:7
.
Constantly keep in mind Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [as] risen from the dead, [as the prophesied King] descended from David, according to the good news (the Gospel) that I preach. -- 2 timothy 2:8
.
For that [Gospel] I am suffering affliction and even wearing chains like a criminal. But the Word of God is not chained or imprisoned! -- 2 timothy 2:9
.
Therefore I [am ready to] persevere and stand my ground with patience and endure everything for the sake of the elect [God's chosen], so that they too may obtain [the] salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with [the reward of] eternal glory. -- 2 timothy 2:10
.
The saying is sure and worthy of confidence: If we have died with Him, we shall also live with Him. -- 2 timothy 2:11
.
If we endure, we shall also reign with Him. If we deny and disown and reject Him, He will also deny and disown and reject us. -- 2 timothy 2:12
.
If we are faithless [do not believe and are untrue to Him], He remains true (faithful to His Word and His righteous character), for He cannot deny Himself. -- 2 timothy 2:13
.
Remind [the people] of these facts and [solemnly] charge them in the presence of the Lord to avoid petty controversy over words, which does no good but upsets and undermines the faith of the hearers. -- 2 timothy 2:14
.
Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analyzing and accurately dividing [rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth. -- 2 timothy 2:15
.
But avoid all empty (vain, useless, idle) talk, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness. -- 2 timothy 2:16
.
And their teaching [will devour; it] will eat its way like cancer or spread like gangrene. So it is with Hymenaeus and Philetus, -- 2 timothy 2:17
.
Who have missed the mark and swerved from the truth by arguing that the resurrection has already taken place. They are undermining the faith of some. -- 2 timothy 2:18
.
But the firm foundation of (laid by) God stands, sure and unshaken, bearing this seal (inscription): The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names [himself by] the name of the Lord give up all iniquity and stand aloof from it. -- 2 timothy 2:19
.
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also [utensils] of wood and earthenware, and some for honorable and noble [use] and some for menial and ignoble [use]. -- 2 timothy 2:20
.
So whoever cleanses himself [from what is ignoble and unclean, who separates himself from contact with contaminating and corrupting influences] will [then himself] be a vessel set apart and useful for honorable and noble purposes, consecrated and profitable to the Master, fit and ready for any good work. -- 2 timothy 2:21
.
Shun youthful lusts and flee from them, and aim at and pursue righteousness (all that is virtuous and good, right living, conformity to the will of God in thought, word, and deed); [and aim at and pursue] faith, love, [and] peace (harmony and concord with others) in fellowship with all [Christians], who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart. -- 2 timothy 2:22
.
But refuse (shut your mind against, have nothing to do with) trifling (ill-informed, unedifying, stupid) controversies over ignorant questionings, for you know that they foster strife and breed quarrels. -- 2 timothy 2:23
.
And the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome (fighting and contending). Instead, he must be kindly to everyone and mild-tempered [preserving the bond of peace]; he must be a skilled and suitable teacher, patient and forbearing and willing to suffer wrong. -- 2 timothy 2:24
.
He must correct his opponents with courtesy and gentleness, in the hope that God may grant that they will repent and come to know the Truth [that they will perceive and recognize and become accurately acquainted with and acknowledge it], -- 2 timothy 2:25
.
And that they may come to their senses [and] escape out of the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him, [henceforth] to do His [God's] will. -- 2 timothy 2:26
.
BUT UNDERSTAND this, that in the last days will come (set in) perilous times of great stress and trouble [hard to deal with and hard to bear]. -- 2 timothy 3:1
.
For people will be lovers of self and [utterly] self-centered, lovers of money and aroused by an inordinate [greedy] desire for wealth, proud and arrogant and contemptuous boasters. They will be abusive (blasphemous, scoffing), disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy and profane. -- 2 timothy 3:2
.
[They will be] without natural [human] affection (callous and inhuman), relentless (admitting of no truce or appeasement); [they will be] slanderers (false accusers, troublemakers), intemperate and loose in morals and conduct, uncontrolled and fierce, haters of good. -- 2 timothy 3:3
.
[They will be] treacherous [betrayers], rash, [and] inflated with self-conceit. [They will be] lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of God. -- 2 timothy 3:4
.
For [although] they hold a form of piety (true religion), they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it [their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession]. Avoid [all] such people [turn away from them]. -- 2 timothy 3:5
.
For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate silly and weak-natured and spiritually dwarfed women, loaded down with [the burden of their] sins [and easily] swayed and led away by various evil desires and seductive impulses. -- 2 timothy 3:6
.
[These weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them]; they are forever inquiring and getting information, but are never able to arrive at a recognition and knowledge of the Truth. -- 2 timothy 3:7
.
Now just as Jannes and Jambres were hostile to and resisted Moses, so these men also are hostile to and oppose the Truth. They have depraved and distorted minds, and are reprobate and counterfeit and to be rejected as far as the faith is concerned. -- 2 timothy 3:8
.
But they will not get very far, for their rash folly will become obvious to everybody, as was that of those [magicians mentioned]. -- 2 timothy 3:9
.
Now you have closely observed and diligently followed my teaching, conduct, purpose in life, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, -- 2 timothy 3:10
.
Persecutions, sufferings--such as occurred to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra, persecutions I endured, but out of them all the Lord delivered me. -- 2 timothy 3:11
.
Indeed all who delight in piety and are determined to live a devoted and godly life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution [will be made to suffer because of their religious stand]. -- 2 timothy 3:12
.
But wicked men and imposters will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and leading astray others and being deceived and led astray themselves. -- 2 timothy 3:13
.
But as for you, continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you are convinced, knowing from whom you learned [them], -- 2 timothy 3:14
.
And how from your childhood you have had a knowledge of and been acquainted with the sacred Writings, which are able to instruct you and give you the understanding for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus [through the leaning of the entire human personality on God in Christ Jesus in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness]. -- 2 timothy 3:15
.
Every Scripture is God-breathed (given by His inspiration) and profitable for instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction of error and discipline in obedience, [and] for training in righteousness (in holy living, in conformity to God's will in thought, purpose, and action), -- 2 timothy 3:16
.
So that the man of God may be complete and proficient, well fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work. -- 2 timothy 3:17
.
I CHARGE [you] in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, Who is to judge the living and the dead, and by (in the light of) His coming and His kingdom: -- 2 timothy 4:1
.
Herald and preach the Word! Keep your sense of urgency [stand by, be at hand and ready], whether the opportunity seems to be favorable or unfavorable. [Whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether it is welcome or unwelcome, you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what way their lives are wrong.] And convince them, rebuking and correcting, warning and urging and encouraging them, being unflagging and inexhaustible in patience and teaching. -- 2 timothy 4:2
.
For the time is coming when [people] will not tolerate (endure) sound and wholesome instruction, but, having ears itching [for something pleasing and gratifying], they will gather to themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number, chosen to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors they hold, -- 2 timothy 4:3
.
And will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths and man-made fictions. -- 2 timothy 4:4
.
As for you, be calm and cool and steady, accept and suffer unflinchingly every hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully perform all the duties of your ministry. -- 2 timothy 4:5
.
For I am already about to be sacrificed [my life is about to be poured out as a drink offering]; the time of my [spirit's] release [from the body] is at hand and I will soon go free. -- 2 timothy 4:6
.
I have fought the good (worthy, honorable, and noble) fight, I have finished the race, I have kept (firmly held) the faith. -- 2 timothy 4:7
.
[As to what remains] henceforth there is laid up for me the [victor's] crown of righteousness [for being right with God and doing right], which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me and recompense me on that [great] day--and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved and yearned for and welcomed His appearing (His return). -- 2 timothy 4:8
.
Make every effort to come to me soon. -- 2 timothy 4:9
.
For Demas has deserted me for love of this present world and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens [has gone] to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. -- 2 timothy 4:10
.
Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very helpful to me for the ministry. -- 2 timothy 4:11
.
Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. -- 2 timothy 4:12
.
[When] you come, bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, also the books, especially the parchments. -- 2 timothy 4:13
.
Alexander the coppersmith did me great wrongs. The Lord will pay him back for his actions. -- 2 timothy 4:14
.
Beware of him yourself, for he opposed and resisted our message very strongly and exceedingly. -- 2 timothy 4:15
.
At my first trial no one acted in my defense [as my advocate] or took my part or [even] stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them! -- 2 timothy 4:16
.
But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the [Gospel] message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was delivered out of the jaws of the lion. -- 2 timothy 4:17
.
[And indeed] the Lord will certainly deliver and draw me to Himself from every assault of evil. He will preserve and bring me safe unto His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen (so be it). -- 2 timothy 4:18
.
Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and to the household of Onesiphorus. -- 2 timothy 4:19
.
Erastus stayed on at Corinth, but Trophimus I left ill at Miletus. -- 2 timothy 4:20
.
Do hasten and try your best to come to me before winter. Eubulus wishes to be remembered to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren. -- 2 timothy 4:21
.
The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace (God's favor and blessing) be with you. Amen (so be it). -- 2 timothy 4:22
.
PAUL, A bond servant of God and an apostle (a special messenger) of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) to stimulate and promote the faith of God's chosen ones and to lead them on to accurate discernment and recognition of and acquaintance with the Truth which belongs to and harmonizes with and tends to godliness, -- titus 1:1
.
[Resting] in the hope of eternal life, [life] which the ever truthful God Who cannot deceive promised before the world or the ages of time began. -- titus 1:2
.
And [now] in His own appointed time He has made manifest (made known) His Word and revealed it as His message through the preaching entrusted to me by command of God our Savior; -- titus 1:3
.
To Titus, my true child according to a common (general) faith: Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) and [heart] peace from God the Father and the Lord Christ Jesus our Savior. -- titus 1:4
.
For this reason I left you [behind] in Crete, that you might set right what was defective and finish what was left undone, and that you might appoint elders and set them over the churches (assemblies) in every city as I directed you. -- titus 1:5
.
[These elders should be] men who are of unquestionable integrity and are irreproachable, the husband of [but] one wife, whose children are [well trained and are] believers, not open to the accusation of being loose in morals and conduct or unruly and disorderly. -- titus 1:6
.
For the bishop (an overseer) as God's steward must be blameless, not self-willed or arrogant or presumptuous; he must not be quick-tempered or given to drink or pugnacious (brawling, violent); he must not be grasping and greedy for filthy lucre (financial gain); -- titus 1:7
.
But he must be hospitable (loving and a friend to believers, especially to strangers and foreigners); [he must be] a lover of goodness [of good people and good things], sober-minded (sensible, discreet), upright and fair-minded, a devout man and religiously correct, temperate and keeping himself in hand. -- titus 1:8
.
He must hold fast to the sure and trustworthy Word of God as he was taught it, so that he may be able both to give stimulating instruction and encouragement in sound (wholesome) doctrine and to refute and convict those who contradict and oppose it [showing the wayward their error]. -- titus 1:9
.
For there are many disorderly and unruly men who are idle (vain, empty) and misleading talkers and self-deceivers and deceivers of others. [This is true] especially of those of the circumcision party [who have come over from Judaism]. -- titus 1:10
.
Their mouths must be stopped, for they are mentally distressing and subverting whole families by teaching what they ought not to teach, for the purpose of getting base advantage and disreputable gain. -- titus 1:11
.
One of their [very] number, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, hurtful beasts, idle and lazy gluttons. -- titus 1:12
.
And this account of them is [really] true. Because it is [true], rebuke them sharply [deal sternly, even severely with them], so that they may be sound in the faith and free from error, -- titus 1:13
.
[And may show their soundness by] ceasing to give attention to Jewish myths and fables or to rules [laid down] by [mere] men who reject and turn their backs on the Truth. -- titus 1:14
.
To the pure [in heart and conscience] all things are pure, but to the defiled and corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are defiled and polluted. -- titus 1:15
.
They profess to know God [to recognize, perceive, and be acquainted with Him], but deny and disown and renounce Him by what they do; they are detestable and loathsome, unbelieving and disobedient and disloyal and rebellious, and [they are] unfit and worthless for good work (deed or enterprise) of any kind. -- titus 1:16
.
BUT [as for] you, teach what is fitting and becoming to sound (wholesome) doctrine [the character and right living that identify true Christians]. -- titus 2:1
.
Urge the older men to be temperate, venerable (serious), sensible, self-controlled, and sound in the faith, in the love, and in the steadfastness and patience [of Christ]. -- titus 2:2
.
Bid the older women similarly to be reverent and devout in their deportment as becomes those engaged in sacred service, not slanderers or slaves to drink. They are to give good counsel and be teachers of what is right and noble, -- titus 2:3
.
So that they will wisely train the young women to be sane and sober of mind (temperate, disciplined) and to love their husbands and their children, -- titus 2:4
.
To be self-controlled, chaste, homemakers, good-natured (kindhearted), adapting and subordinating themselves to their husbands, that the word of God may not be exposed to reproach (blasphemed or discredited). -- titus 2:5
.
In a similar way, urge the younger men to be self-restrained and to behave prudently [taking life seriously]. -- titus 2:6
.
And show your own self in all respects to be a pattern and a model of good deeds and works, teaching what is unadulterated, showing gravity [having the strictest regard for truth and purity of motive], with dignity and seriousness. -- titus 2:7
.
And let your instruction be sound and fit and wise and wholesome, vigorous and irrefutable and above censure, so that the opponent may be put to shame, finding nothing discrediting or evil to say about us. -- titus 2:8
.
[Tell] bond servants to be submissive to their masters, to be pleasing and give satisfaction in every way. [Warn them] not to talk back or contradict, -- titus 2:9
.
Nor to steal by taking things of small value, but to prove themselves truly loyal and entirely reliable and faithful throughout, so that in everything they may be an ornament and do credit to the teaching [which is] from and about God our Savior. -- titus 2:10
.
For the grace of God (His unmerited favor and blessing) has come forward (appeared) for the deliverance from sin and the eternal salvation for all mankind. -- titus 2:11
.
It has trained us to reject and renounce all ungodliness (irreligion) and worldly (passionate) desires, to live discreet (temperate, self-controlled), upright, devout (spiritually whole) lives in this present world, -- titus 2:12
.
Awaiting and looking for the [fulfillment, the realization of our] blessed hope, even the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed One), -- titus 2:13
.
Who gave Himself on our behalf that He might redeem us (purchase our freedom) from all iniquity and purify for Himself a people [to be peculiarly His own, people who are] eager and enthusiastic about [living a life that is good and filled with] beneficial deeds. -- titus 2:14
.
Tell [them all] these things. Urge (advise, encourage, warn) and rebuke with full authority. Let no one despise or disregard or think little of you [conduct yourself and your teaching so as to command respect]. -- titus 2:15
.
REMIND PEOPLE to be submissive to [their] magistrates and authorities, to be obedient, to be prepared and willing to do any upright and honorable work, -- titus 3:1
.
To slander or abuse or speak evil of no one, to avoid being contentious, to be forbearing (yielding, gentle, and conciliatory), and to show unqualified courtesy toward everybody. -- titus 3:2
.
For we also were once thoughtless and senseless, obstinate and disobedient, deluded and misled; [we too were once] slaves to all sorts of cravings and pleasures, wasting our days in malice and jealousy and envy, hateful (hated, detestable) and hating one another. -- titus 3:3
.
But when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Savior to man [as man] appeared, -- titus 3:4
.
He saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we had done, but because of His own pity and mercy, by [the] cleansing [bath] of the new birth (regeneration) and renewing of the Holy Spirit, -- titus 3:5
.
Which He poured out [so] richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior. -- titus 3:6
.
[And He did it in order] that we might be justified by His grace (by His favor, wholly undeserved), [that we might be acknowledged and counted as conformed to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action], and that we might become heirs of eternal life according to [our] hope. -- titus 3:7
.
This message is most trustworthy, and concerning these things I want you to insist steadfastly, so that those who have believed in (trusted in, relied on) God may be careful to apply themselves to honorable occupations and to doing good, for such things are [not only] excellent and right [in themselves], but [they are] good and profitable for the people. -- titus 3:8
.
But avoid stupid and foolish controversies and genealogies and dissensions and wrangling about the Law, for they are unprofitable and futile. -- titus 3:9
.
[As for] a man who is factious [a heretical sectarian and cause of divisions], after admonishing him a first and second time, reject [him from your fellowship and have nothing more to do with him], -- titus 3:10
.
Well aware that such a person has utterly changed (is perverted and corrupted); he goes on sinning [though he] is convicted of guilt and self-condemned. -- titus 3:11
.
When I send Artemas or [perhaps] Tychicus to you, lose no time but make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. -- titus 3:12
.
Do your utmost to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they want for (lack) nothing. -- titus 3:13
.
And let our own [people really] learn to apply themselves to good deeds (to honest labor and honorable employment), so that they may be able to meet necessary demands whenever the occasion may require and not be living idle and uncultivated and unfruitful lives. -- titus 3:14
.
All who are with me wish to be remembered to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace (God's favor and blessing) be with you all. Amen (so be it). -- titus 3:15
.
PAUL, A prisoner [for the sake] of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), and our brother Timothy, to Philemon our dearly beloved sharer with us in our work, -- philemon 1:1
.
And to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier [in the Christian warfare], and to the church [assembly that meets] in your house: -- philemon 1:2
.
Grace (spiritual blessing and favor) be to all of you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- philemon 1:3
.
I give thanks to my God for you always when I mention you in my prayers, -- philemon 1:4
.
Because I continue to hear of your love and of your loyal faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and [which you show] toward all the saints (God's consecrated people). -- philemon 1:5
.
[And I pray] that the participation in and sharing of your faith may produce and promote full recognition and appreciation and understanding and precise knowledge of every good [thing] that is ours in [our identification with] Christ Jesus [and unto His glory]. -- philemon 1:6
.
For I have derived great joy and comfort and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints [who are your fellow Christians] have been cheered and refreshed through you, [my] brother. -- philemon 1:7
.
Therefore, though I have abundant boldness in Christ to charge you to do what is fitting and required and your duty to do, -- philemon 1:8
.
Yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you just for what I am--I, Paul, an ambassador [of Christ Jesus] and an old man and now a prisoner for His sake also-- -- philemon 1:9
.
I appeal to you for my [own spiritual] child, Onesimus [meaning profitable], whom I have begotten [in the faith] while a captive in these chains. -- philemon 1:10
.
Once he was unprofitable to you, but now he is indeed profitable to you as well as to me. -- philemon 1:11
.
I am sending him back to you in his own person, [and it is like sending] my very heart. -- philemon 1:12
.
I would have chosen to keep him with me, in order that he might minister to my needs in your stead during my imprisonment for the Gospel's sake. -- philemon 1:13
.
But it has been my wish to do nothing about it without first consulting you and getting your consent, in order that your benevolence might not seem to be the result of compulsion or of pressure but might be voluntary [on your part]. -- philemon 1:14
.
Perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated [from you] for a while, that you might have him back as yours forever, -- philemon 1:15
.
Not as a slave any longer but as [something] more than a slave, as a brother [Christian], especially dear to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh [as a servant] and in the Lord [as a fellow believer]. -- philemon 1:16
.
If then you consider me a partner and a comrade in fellowship, welcome and receive him as you would [welcome and receive] me. -- philemon 1:17
.
And if he has done you any wrong in any way or owes anything [to you], charge that to my account. -- philemon 1:18
.
I, Paul, write it with my own hand, I promise to repay it [in full]--and that is to say nothing [of the fact] that you owe me your very self! -- philemon 1:19
.
Yes, brother, let me have some profit from you in the Lord. Cheer and refresh my heart in Christ. -- philemon 1:20
.
I write to you [perfectly] confident of your obedient compliance, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. -- philemon 1:21
.
At the same time prepare a guest room [in expectation of extending your hospitality] to me, for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted [the gracious privilege of coming] to you. -- philemon 1:22
.
Greetings to you from Epaphras, my fellow prisoner here in [the cause of] Christ Jesus (the Messiah), -- philemon 1:23
.
And [from] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. -- philemon 1:24
.
The grace (blessing and favor) of the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with your spirit. Amen (so be it). -- philemon 1:25
.
IN MANY separate revelations [each of which set forth a portion of the Truth] and in different ways God spoke of old to [our] forefathers in and by the prophets, -- hebrews 1:1
.
[But] in the last of these days He has spoken to us in [the person of a] Son, Whom He appointed Heir and lawful Owner of all things, also by and through Whom He created the worlds and the reaches of space and the ages of time [He made, produced, built, operated, and arranged them in order]. -- hebrews 1:2
.
He is the sole expression of the glory of God [the Light-being, the out-raying or radiance of the divine], and He is the perfect imprint and very image of [God's] nature, upholding and maintaining and guiding and propelling the universe by His mighty word of power. When He had by offering Himself accomplished our cleansing of sins and riddance of guilt, He sat down at the right hand of the divine Majesty on high, -- hebrews 1:3
.
[Taking a place and rank by which] He Himself became as much superior to angels as the glorious Name (title) which He has inherited is different from and more excellent than theirs. -- hebrews 1:4
.
For to which of the angels did [God] ever say, You are My Son, today I have begotten You [established You in an official Sonship relation, with kingly dignity]? And again, I will be to Him a Father, and He will be to Me a Son? [II Sam. 7:14; Ps. 2:7.] -- hebrews 1:5
.
Moreover, when He brings the firstborn Son again into the habitable world, He says, Let all the angels of God worship Him. -- hebrews 1:6
.
Referring to the angels He says, [God] Who makes His angels winds and His ministering servants flames of fire; -- hebrews 1:7
.
But as to the Son, He says to Him, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever (to the ages of the ages), and the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of absolute righteousness (of justice and straightforwardness). -- hebrews 1:8
.
You have loved righteousness [You have delighted in integrity, virtue, and uprightness in purpose, thought, and action] and You have hated lawlessness (injustice and iniquity). Therefore God, [even] Your God (Godhead), has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy and gladness above and beyond Your companions. -- hebrews 1:9
.
And [further], You, Lord, did lay the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of Your hands. -- hebrews 1:10
.
They will perish, but You remain and continue permanently; they will all grow old and wear out like a garment. -- hebrews 1:11
.
Like a mantle [thrown about one's self] You will roll them up, and they will be changed and replaced by others. But You remain the same, and Your years will never end nor come to failure. -- hebrews 1:12
.
Besides, to which of the angels has He ever said, Sit at My right hand [associated with Me in My royal dignity] till I make your enemies a stool for your feet? -- hebrews 1:13
.
Are not the angels all ministering spirits (servants) sent out in the service [of God for the assistance] of those who are to inherit salvation? -- hebrews 1:14
.
SINCE ALL this is true, we ought to pay much closer attention than ever to the truths that we have heard, lest in any way we drift past [them] and slip away. -- hebrews 2:1
.
For if the message given through angels [the Law spoken by them to Moses] was authentic and proved sure, and every violation and disobedience received an appropriate (just and adequate) penalty, -- hebrews 2:2
.
How shall we escape [appropriate retribution] if we neglect and refuse to pay attention to such a great salvation [as is now offered to us, letting it drift past us forever]? For it was declared at first by the Lord [Himself], and it was confirmed to us and proved to be real and genuine by those who personally heard [Him speak]. -- hebrews 2:3
.
[Besides this evidence] it was also established and plainly endorsed by God, Who showed His approval of it by signs and wonders and various miraculous manifestations of [His] power and by imparting the gifts of the Holy Spirit [to the believers] according to His own will. -- hebrews 2:4
.
For it was not to angels that God subjected the habitable world of the future, of which we are speaking. -- hebrews 2:5
.
It has been solemnly and earnestly said in a certain place, What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You graciously and helpfully care for and visit and look after him? -- hebrews 2:6
.
For some little time You have ranked him lower than and inferior to the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Your hands, -- hebrews 2:7
.
For You have put everything in subjection under his feet. Now in putting everything in subjection to man, He left nothing outside [of man's] control. But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him [man]. -- hebrews 2:8
.
But we are able to see Jesus, Who was ranked lower than the angels for a little while, crowned with glory and honor because of His having suffered death, in order that by the grace (unmerited favor) of God [to us sinners] He might experience death for every individual person. -- hebrews 2:9
.
For it was an act worthy [of God] and fitting [to the divine nature] that He, for Whose sake and by Whom all things have their existence, in bringing many sons into glory, should make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect [should bring to maturity the human experience necessary to be perfectly equipped for His office as High Priest] through suffering. -- hebrews 2:10
.
For both He Who sanctifies [making men holy] and those who are sanctified all have one [Father]. For this reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren; -- hebrews 2:11
.
For He says, I will declare Your [the Father's] name to My brethren; in the midst of the [worshiping] congregation I will sing hymns of praise to You. -- hebrews 2:12
.
And again He says, My trust and assured reliance and confident hope shall be fixed in Him. And yet again, Here I am, I and the children whom God has given Me. -- hebrews 2:13
.
Since, therefore, [these His] children share in flesh and blood [in the physical nature of human beings], He [Himself] in a similar manner partook of the same [nature], that by [going through] death He might bring to nought and make of no effect him who had the power of death--that is, the devil-- -- hebrews 2:14
.
And also that He might deliver and completely set free all those who through the [haunting] fear of death were held in bondage throughout the whole course of their lives. -- hebrews 2:15
.
For, as we all know, He [Christ] did not take hold of angels [the fallen angels, to give them a helping and delivering hand], but He did take hold of [the fallen] descendants of Abraham [to reach out to them a helping and delivering hand]. -- hebrews 2:16
.
So it is evident that it was essential that He be made like His brethren in every respect, in order that He might become a merciful (sympathetic) and faithful High Priest in the things related to God, to make atonement and propitiation for the people's sins. -- hebrews 2:17
.
For because He Himself [in His humanity] has suffered in being tempted (tested and tried), He is able [immediately] to run to the cry of (assist, relieve) those who are being tempted and tested and tried [and who therefore are being exposed to suffering]. -- hebrews 2:18
.
SO THEN, brethren, consecrated and set apart for God, who share in the heavenly calling, [thoughtfully and attentively] consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest Whom we confessed [as ours when we embraced the Christian faith]. -- hebrews 3:1
.
[See how] faithful He was to Him Who appointed Him [Apostle and High Priest], as Moses was also faithful in the whole house [of God]. -- hebrews 3:2
.
Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater honor and glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house [itself]. -- hebrews 3:3
.
For [of course] every house is built and furnished by someone, but the Builder of all things and the Furnisher [of the entire equipment of all things] is God. -- hebrews 3:4
.
And Moses certainly was faithful in the administration of all God's house [but it was only] as a ministering servant. [In his entire ministry he was but] a testimony to the things which were to be spoken [the revelations to be given afterward in Christ]. -- hebrews 3:5
.
But Christ (the Messiah) was faithful over His [own Father's] house as a Son [and Master of it]. And it is we who are [now members] of this house, if we hold fast and firm to the end our joyful and exultant confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [in Christ]. -- hebrews 3:6
.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: Today, if you will hear His voice, -- hebrews 3:7
.
Do not harden your hearts, as [happened] in the rebellion [of Israel] and their provocation and embitterment [of Me] in the day of testing in the wilderness, -- hebrews 3:8
.
Where your fathers tried [My patience] and tested [My forbearance] and found I stood their test, and they saw My works for forty years. -- hebrews 3:9
.
And so I was provoked (displeased and sorely grieved) with that generation, and said, They always err and are led astray in their hearts, and they have not perceived or recognized My ways and become progressively better and more experimentally and intimately acquainted with them. -- hebrews 3:10
.
Accordingly, I swore in My wrath and indignation, They shall not enter into My rest. -- hebrews 3:11
.
[Therefore beware] brethren, take care, lest there be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving heart [which refuses to cleave to, trust in, and rely on Him], leading you to turn away and desert or stand aloof from the living God. -- hebrews 3:12
.
But instead warn (admonish, urge, and encourage) one another every day, as long as it is called Today, that none of you may be hardened [into settled rebellion] by the deceitfulness of sin [by the fraudulence, the stratagem, the trickery which the delusive glamor of his sin may play on him]. -- hebrews 3:13
.
For we have become fellows with Christ (the Messiah) and share in all He has for us, if only we hold our first newborn confidence and original assured expectation [in virtue of which we are believers] firm and unshaken to the end. -- hebrews 3:14
.
Then while it is [still] called Today, if you would hear His voice and when you hear it, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion [in the desert, when the people provoked and irritated and embittered God against them]. -- hebrews 3:15
.
For who were they who heard and yet were rebellious and provoked [Him]? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses? -- hebrews 3:16
.
And with whom was He irritated and provoked and grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dismembered bodies were strewn and left in the desert? -- hebrews 3:17
.
And to whom did He swear that they should not enter His rest, but to those who disobeyed [who had not listened to His word and who refused to be compliant or be persuaded]? -- hebrews 3:18
.
So we see that they were not able to enter [into His rest], because of their unwillingness to adhere to and trust in and rely on God [unbelief had shut them out]. -- hebrews 3:19
.
THEREFORE, WHILE the promise of entering His rest still holds and is offered [today], let us be afraid [to distrust it], lest any of you should think he has come too late and has come short of [reaching] it. -- hebrews 4:1
.
For indeed we have had the glad tidings [Gospel of God] proclaimed to us just as truly as they [the Israelites of old did when the good news of deliverance from bondage came to them]; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith (with the leaning of the entire personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness) by those who heard it; neither were they united in faith with the ones [Joshua and Caleb] who heard (did believe). -- hebrews 4:2
.
For we who have believed (adhered to and trusted in and relied on God) do enter that rest, in accordance with His declaration that those [who did not believe] should not enter when He said, As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter My rest; and this He said although [His] works had been completed and prepared [and waiting for all who would believe] from the foundation of the world. -- hebrews 4:3
.
For in a certain place He has said this about the seventh day: And God rested on the seventh day from all His works. -- hebrews 4:4
.
And [they forfeited their part in it, for] in this [passage] He said, They shall not enter My rest. -- hebrews 4:5
.
Seeing then that the promise remains over [from past times] for some to enter that rest, and that those who formerly were given the good news about it and the opportunity, failed to appropriate it and did not enter because of disobedience, -- hebrews 4:6
.
Again He sets a definite day, [a new] Today, [and gives another opportunity of securing that rest] saying through David after so long a time in the words already quoted, Today, if you would hear His voice and when you hear it, do not harden your hearts. -- hebrews 4:7
.
[This mention of a rest was not a reference to their entering into Canaan.] For if Joshua had given them rest, He [God] would not speak afterward about another day. -- hebrews 4:8
.
So then, there is still awaiting a full and complete Sabbath-rest reserved for the [true] people of God; -- hebrews 4:9
.
For he who has once entered [God's] rest also has ceased from [the weariness and pain] of human labors, just as God rested from those labors peculiarly His own. -- hebrews 4:10
.
Let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest [of God, to know and experience it for ourselves], that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and disobedience [into which those in the wilderness fell]. -- hebrews 4:11
.
For the Word that God speaks is alive and full of power [making it active, operative, energizing, and effective]; it is sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life (soul) and [the immortal] spirit, and of joints and marrow [of the deepest parts of our nature], exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart. -- hebrews 4:12
.
And not a creature exists that is concealed from His sight, but all things are open and exposed, naked and defenseless to the eyes of Him with Whom we have to do. -- hebrews 4:13
.
Inasmuch then as we have a great High Priest Who has [already] ascended and passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession [of faith in Him]. -- hebrews 4:14
.
For we do not have a High Priest Who is unable to understand and sympathize and have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities and liability to the assaults of temptation, but One Who has been tempted in every respect as we are, yet without sinning. -- hebrews 4:15
.
Let us then fearlessly and confidently and boldly draw near to the throne of grace (the throne of God's unmerited favor to us sinners), that we may receive mercy [for our failures] and find grace to help in good time for every need [appropriate help and well-timed help, coming just when we need it]. -- hebrews 4:16
.
FOR EVERY high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in things relating to God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. -- hebrews 5:1
.
He is able to exercise gentleness and forbearance toward the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is liable to moral weakness and physical infirmity. -- hebrews 5:2
.
And because of this he is obliged to offer sacrifice for his own sins, as well as for those of the people. -- hebrews 5:3
.
Besides, one does not appropriate for himself the honor [of being high priest], but he is called by God and receives it of Him, just as Aaron did. -- hebrews 5:4
.
So too Christ (the Messiah) did not exalt Himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed and exalted by Him Who said to Him, You are My Son; today I have begotten You; -- hebrews 5:5
.
As He says also in another place, You are a Priest [appointed] forever after the order (with the rank) of Melchizedek. -- hebrews 5:6
.
In the days of His flesh [Jesus] offered up definite, special petitions [for that which He not only wanted but needed] and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him Who was [always] able to save Him [out] from death, and He was heard because of His reverence toward God [His godly fear, His piety, in that He shrank from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the Father]. -- hebrews 5:7
.
Although He was a Son, He learned [active, special] obedience through what He suffered -- hebrews 5:8
.
And, [His completed experience] making Him perfectly [equipped], He became the Author and Source of eternal salvation to all those who give heed and obey Him, -- hebrews 5:9
.
Being designated and recognized and saluted by God as High Priest after the order (with the rank) of Melchizedek. -- hebrews 5:10
.
Concerning this we have much to say which is hard to explain, since you have become dull in your [spiritual] hearing and sluggish [even slothful in achieving spiritual insight]. -- hebrews 5:11
.
For even though by this time you ought to be teaching others, you actually need someone to teach you over again the very first principles of God's Word. You have come to need milk, not solid food. -- hebrews 5:12
.
For everyone who continues to feed on milk is obviously inexperienced and unskilled in the doctrine of righteousness (of conformity to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action), for he is a mere infant [not able to talk yet]! -- hebrews 5:13
.
But solid food is for full-grown men, for those whose senses and mental faculties are trained by practice to discriminate and distinguish between what is morally good and noble and what is evil and contrary either to divine or human law. -- hebrews 5:14
.
THEREFORE LET us go on and get past the elementary stage in the teachings and doctrine of Christ (the Messiah), advancing steadily toward the completeness and perfection that belong to spiritual maturity. Let us not again be laying the foundation of repentance and abandonment of dead works (dead formalism) and of the faith [by which you turned] to God, -- hebrews 6:1
.
With teachings about purifying, the laying on of hands, the resurrection from the dead, and eternal judgment and punishment. [These are all matters of which you should have been fully aware long, long ago.] -- hebrews 6:2
.
If indeed God permits, we will [now] proceed [to advanced teaching]. -- hebrews 6:3
.
For it is impossible [to restore and bring again to repentance] those who have been once for all enlightened, who have consciously tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers of the Holy Spirit, -- hebrews 6:4
.
And have felt how good the Word of God is and the mighty powers of the age and world to come, -- hebrews 6:5
.
If they then deviate from the faith and turn away from their allegiance--[it is impossible] to bring them back to repentance, for (because, while, as long as) they nail upon the cross the Son of God afresh [as far as they are concerned] and are holding [Him] up to contempt and shame and public disgrace. -- hebrews 6:6
.
For the soil which has drunk the rain that repeatedly falls upon it and produces vegetation useful to those for whose benefit it is cultivated partakes of a blessing from God. -- hebrews 6:7
.
But if [that same soil] persistently bears thorns and thistles, it is considered worthless and near to being cursed, whose end is to be burned. -- hebrews 6:8
.
Even though we speak this way, yet in your case, beloved, we are now firmly convinced of better things that are near to salvation and accompany it. -- hebrews 6:9
.
For God is not unrighteous to forget or overlook your labor and the love which you have shown for His name's sake in ministering to the needs of the saints (His own consecrated people), as you still do. -- hebrews 6:10
.
But we do [strongly and earnestly] desire for each of you to show the same diligence and sincerity [all the way through] in realizing and enjoying the full assurance and development of [your] hope until the end, -- hebrews 6:11
.
In order that you may not grow disinterested and become [spiritual] sluggards, but imitators, behaving as do those who through faith (by their leaning of the entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness) and by practice of patient endurance and waiting are [now] inheriting the promises. -- hebrews 6:12
.
For when God made [His] promise to Abraham, He swore by Himself, since He had no one greater by whom to swear, -- hebrews 6:13
.
Saying, Blessing I certainly will bless you and multiplying I will multiply you. -- hebrews 6:14
.
And so it was that he [Abraham], having waited long and endured patiently, realized and obtained [in the birth of Isaac as a pledge of what was to come] what God had promised him. -- hebrews 6:15
.
Men indeed swear by a greater [than themselves], and with them in all disputes the oath taken for confirmation is final [ending strife]. -- hebrews 6:16
.
Accordingly God also, in His desire to show more convincingly and beyond doubt to those who were to inherit the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose and plan, intervened (mediated) with an oath. -- hebrews 6:17
.
This was so that, by two unchangeable things [His promise and His oath] in which it is impossible for God ever to prove false or deceive us, we who have fled [to Him] for refuge might have mighty indwelling strength and strong encouragement to grasp and hold fast the hope appointed for us and set before [us]. -- hebrews 6:18
.
[Now] we have this [hope] as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul [it cannot slip and it cannot break down under whoever steps out upon it--a hope] that reaches farther and enters into [the very certainty of the Presence] within the veil, -- hebrews 6:19
.
Where Jesus has entered in for us [in advance], a Forerunner having become a High Priest forever after the order (with the rank) of Melchizedek. -- hebrews 6:20
.
FOR THIS Melchizedek, king of Salem [and] priest of the Most High God, met Abraham as he returned from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, -- hebrews 7:1
.
And Abraham gave to him a tenth portion of all [the spoil]. He is primarily, as his name when translated indicates, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, which means king of peace. -- hebrews 7:2
.
Without [record of] father or mother or ancestral line, neither with beginning of days nor ending of life, but, resembling the Son of God, he continues to be a priest without interruption and without successor. -- hebrews 7:3
.
Now observe and consider how great [a personage] this was to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth [the topmost or the pick of the heap] of the spoils. -- hebrews 7:4
.
And it is true that those descendants of Levi who are charged with the priestly office are commanded in the Law to take tithes from the people--which means, from their brethren--though these have descended from Abraham. -- hebrews 7:5
.
But this person who has not their Levitical ancestry received tithes from Abraham [himself] and blessed him who possessed the promises [of God]. -- hebrews 7:6
.
Yet it is beyond all contradiction that it is the lesser person who is blessed by the greater one. -- hebrews 7:7
.
Furthermore, here [in the Levitical priesthood] tithes are received by men who are subject to death; while there [in the case of Melchizedek], they are received by one of whom it is testified that he lives [perpetually]. -- hebrews 7:8
.
A person might even say that Levi [the father of the priestly tribe] himself, who received tithes (the tenth), paid tithes through Abraham, -- hebrews 7:9
.
For he was still in the loins of his forefather [Abraham] when Melchizedek met him [Abraham]. -- hebrews 7:10
.
Now if perfection (a perfect fellowship between God and the worshiper) had been attainable by the Levitical priesthood--for under it the people were given the Law--why was it further necessary that there should arise another and different kind of Priest, one after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one appointed after the order and rank of Aaron? -- hebrews 7:11
.
For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is of necessity an alteration of the law [concerning the priesthood] as well. -- hebrews 7:12
.
For the One of Whom these things are said belonged [not to the priestly line but] to another tribe, no member of which has officiated at the altar. -- hebrews 7:13
.
For it is obvious that our Lord sprang from the tribe of Judah, and Moses mentioned nothing about priests in connection with that tribe. -- hebrews 7:14
.
And this becomes more plainly evident when another Priest arises Who bears the likeness of Melchizedek, -- hebrews 7:15
.
Who has been constituted a Priest, not on the basis of a bodily legal requirement [an externally imposed command concerning His physical ancestry], but on the basis of the power of an endless and indestructible Life. -- hebrews 7:16
.
For it is witnessed of Him, You are a Priest forever after the order (with the rank) of Melchizedek. -- hebrews 7:17
.
So a previous physical regulation and command is cancelled because of its weakness and ineffectiveness and uselessness-- -- hebrews 7:18
.
For the Law never made anything perfect--but instead a better hope is introduced through which we [now] come close to God. -- hebrews 7:19
.
And it was not without the taking of an oath [that Christ was made Priest], -- hebrews 7:20
.
For those who formerly became priests received their office without its being confirmed by the taking of an oath by God, but this One was designated and addressed and saluted with an oath, The Lord has sworn and will not regret it or change His mind, You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. -- hebrews 7:21
.
In keeping with [the oath's greater strength and force], Jesus has become the Guarantee of a better (stronger) agreement [a more excellent and more advantageous covenant]. -- hebrews 7:22
.
[Again, the former successive line of priests] was made up of many, because they were each prevented by death from continuing [perpetually in office]; -- hebrews 7:23
.
But He holds His priesthood unchangeably, because He lives on forever. -- hebrews 7:24
.
Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost (completely, perfectly, finally, and for all time and eternity) those who come to God through Him, since He is always living to make petition to God and intercede with Him and intervene for them. -- hebrews 7:25
.
[Here is] the High Priest [perfectly adapted] to our needs, as was fitting--holy, blameless, unstained by sin, separated from sinners, and exalted higher than the heavens. -- hebrews 7:26
.
He has no day by day necessity, as [do each of these other] high priests, to offer sacrifice first of all for his own [personal] sins and then for those of the people, because He [met all the requirements] once for all when He brought Himself [as a sacrifice] which He offered up. -- hebrews 7:27
.
For the Law sets up men in their weakness [frail, sinful, dying human beings] as high priests, but the word of [God's] oath, which [was spoken later] after the institution of the Law, [chooses and appoints as priest One Whose appointment is complete and permanent], a Son Who has been made perfect forever. -- hebrews 7:28
.
NOW THE main point of what we have to say is this: We have such a High Priest, One Who is seated at the right hand of the majestic [God] in heaven, -- hebrews 8:1
.
As officiating Priest, a Minister in the holy places and in the true tabernacle which is erected not by man but by the Lord. -- hebrews 8:2
.
For every high priest is appointed to offer up gifts and sacrifices; so it is essential for this [High Priest] to have some offering to make also. -- hebrews 8:3
.
If then He were still living on earth, He would not be a priest at all, for there are [already priests] who offer the gifts in accordance with the Law. -- hebrews 8:4
.
[But these offer] service [merely] as a pattern and as a foreshadowing of [what has its true existence and reality in] the heavenly sanctuary. For when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle, he was warned by God, saying, See to it that you make it all [exactly] according to the copy (the model) which was shown to you on the mountain. -- hebrews 8:5
.
But as it now is, He [Christ] has acquired a [priestly] ministry which is as much superior and more excellent [than the old] as the covenant (the agreement) of which He is the Mediator (the Arbiter, Agent) is superior and more excellent, [because] it is enacted and rests upon more important (sublimer, higher, and nobler) promises. -- hebrews 8:6
.
For if that first covenant had been without defect, there would have been no room for another one or an attempt to institute another one. -- hebrews 8:7
.
However, He finds fault with them [showing its inadequacy] when He says, Behold, the days will come, says the Lord, when I will make and ratify a new covenant or agreement with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. -- hebrews 8:8
.
It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day when I grasped them by the hand to help and relieve them and to lead them out from the land of Egypt, for they did not abide in My agreement with them, and so I withdrew My favor and disregarded them, says the Lord. -- hebrews 8:9
.
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will imprint My laws upon their minds, even upon their innermost thoughts and understanding, and engrave them upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. -- hebrews 8:10
.
And it will nevermore be necessary for each one to teach his neighbor and his fellow citizen or each one his brother, saying, Know (perceive, have knowledge of, and get acquainted by experience with) the Lord, for all will know Me, from the smallest to the greatest of them. -- hebrews 8:11
.
For I will be merciful and gracious toward their sins and I will remember their deeds of unrighteousness no more. -- hebrews 8:12
.
When God speaks of a new [covenant or agreement], He makes the first one obsolete (out of use). And what is obsolete (out of use and annulled because of age) is ripe for disappearance and to be dispensed with altogether. -- hebrews 8:13
.
NOW EVEN the first covenant had its own rules and regulations for divine worship, and it had a sanctuary [but one] of this world. -- hebrews 9:1
.
For a tabernacle (tent) was erected, in the outer division or compartment of which were the lampstand and the table with [its loaves of] the showbread set forth. [This portion] is called the Holy Place. -- hebrews 9:2
.
But [inside] beyond the second curtain or veil, [there stood another] tabernacle [division] known as the Holy of Holies. -- hebrews 9:3
.
It had the golden altar of incense and the ark (chest) of the covenant, covered over with wrought gold. This [ark] contained a golden jar which held the manna and the rod of Aaron that sprouted and the [two stone] slabs of the covenant [bearing the Ten Commandments]. -- hebrews 9:4
.
Above [the ark] and overshadowing the mercy seat were the representations of the cherubim [winged creatures which were the symbols] of glory. We cannot now go into detail about these things. -- hebrews 9:5
.
These arrangements having thus been made, the priests enter [habitually] into the outer division of the tabernacle in performance of their ritual acts of worship. -- hebrews 9:6
.
But into the second [division of the tabernacle] none but the high priest goes, and he only once a year, and never without taking a sacrifice of blood with him, which he offers for himself and for the errors and sins of ignorance and thoughtlessness which the people have committed. -- hebrews 9:7
.
By this the Holy Spirit points out that the way into the [true Holy of] Holies is not yet thrown open as long as the former [the outer portion of the] tabernacle remains a recognized institution and is still standing, -- hebrews 9:8
.
Seeing that that first [outer portion of the] tabernacle was a parable (a visible symbol or type or picture of the present age). In it gifts and sacrifices are offered, and yet are incapable of perfecting the conscience or of cleansing and renewing the inner man of the worshiper. -- hebrews 9:9
.
For [the ceremonies] deal only with clean and unclean meats and drinks and different washings, [mere] external rules and regulations for the body imposed to tide the worshipers over until the time of setting things straight [of reformation, of the complete new order when Christ, the Messiah, shall establish the reality of what these things foreshadow--a better covenant]. -- hebrews 9:10
.
But [that appointed time came] when Christ (the Messiah) appeared as a High Priest of the better things that have come and are to come. [Then] through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with [human] hands, that is, not a part of this material creation, -- hebrews 9:11
.
He went once for all into the [Holy of] Holies [of heaven], not by virtue of the blood of goats and calves [by which to make reconciliation between God and man], but His own blood, having found and secured a complete redemption (an everlasting release for us). -- hebrews 9:12
.
For if [the mere] sprinkling of unholy and defiled persons with blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a burnt heifer is sufficient for the purification of the body, -- hebrews 9:13
.
How much more surely shall the blood of Christ, Who by virtue of [His] eternal Spirit [His own preexistent divine personality] has offered Himself as an unblemished sacrifice to God, purify our consciences from dead works and lifeless observances to serve the [ever] living God? -- hebrews 9:14
.
[Christ, the Messiah] is therefore the Negotiator and Mediator of an [entirely] new agreement (testament, covenant), so that those who are called and offered it may receive the fulfillment of the promised everlasting inheritance--since a death has taken place which rescues and delivers and redeems them from the transgressions committed under the [old] first agreement. -- hebrews 9:15
.
For where there is a [last] will and testament involved, the death of the one who made it must be established, -- hebrews 9:16
.
For a will and testament is valid and takes effect only at death, since it has no force or legal power as long as the one who made it is alive. -- hebrews 9:17
.
So even the [old] first covenant (God's will) was not inaugurated and ratified and put in force without the shedding of blood. -- hebrews 9:18
.
For when every command of the Law had been read out by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of slain calves and goats, together with water and scarlet wool and with a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled both the Book (the roll of the Law and covenant) itself and all the people, -- hebrews 9:19
.
Saying these words: This is the blood that seals and ratifies the agreement (the testament, the covenant) which God commanded [me to deliver to] you. -- hebrews 9:20
.
And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the [sacred] vessels and appliances used in [divine] worship. -- hebrews 9:21
.
[In fact] under the Law almost everything is purified by means of blood, and without the shedding of blood there is neither release from sin and its guilt nor the remission of the due and merited punishment for sins. -- hebrews 9:22
.
By such means, therefore, it was necessary for the [earthly] copies of the heavenly things to be purified, but the actual heavenly things themselves [required far] better and nobler sacrifices than these. -- hebrews 9:23
.
For Christ (the Messiah) has not entered into a sanctuary made with [human] hands, only a copy and pattern and type of the true one, but [He has entered] into heaven itself, now to appear in the [very] presence of God on our behalf. -- hebrews 9:24
.
Nor did He [enter into the heavenly sanctuary to] offer Himself regularly again and again, as the high priest enters the [Holy of] Holies every year with blood not his own. -- hebrews 9:25
.
For then would He often have had to suffer [over and over again] since the foundation of the world. But as it now is, He has once for all at the consummation and close of the ages appeared to put away and abolish sin by His sacrifice [of Himself]. -- hebrews 9:26
.
And just as it is appointed for [all] men once to die, and after that the [certain] judgment, -- hebrews 9:27
.
Even so it is that Christ, having been offered to take upon Himself and bear as a burden the sins of many once and once for all, will appear a second time, not to carry any burden of sin nor to deal with sin, but to bring to full salvation those who are [eagerly, constantly, and patiently] waiting for and expecting Him. -- hebrews 9:28
.
FOR SINCE the Law has merely a rude outline (foreshadowing) of the good things to come--instead of fully expressing those things--it can never by offering the same sacrifices continually year after year make perfect those who approach [its altars]. -- hebrews 10:1
.
For if it were otherwise, would [these sacrifices] not have stopped being offered? Since the worshipers had once for all been cleansed, they would no longer have any guilt or consciousness of sin. -- hebrews 10:2
.
But [as it is] these sacrifices annually bring a fresh remembrance of sins [to be atoned for], -- hebrews 10:3
.
Because the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take sins away. -- hebrews 10:4
.
Hence, when He [Christ] entered into the world, He said, Sacrifices and offerings You have not desired, but instead You have made ready a body for Me [to offer]; -- hebrews 10:5
.
In burnt offerings and sin offerings You have taken no delight. -- hebrews 10:6
.
Then I said, Behold, here I am, coming to do Your will, O God--[to fulfill] what is written of Me in the volume of the Book. -- hebrews 10:7
.
When He said just before, You have neither desired, nor have You taken delight in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings--all of which are offered according to the Law-- -- hebrews 10:8
.
He then went on to say, Behold, [here] I am, coming to do Your will. Thus He does away with and annuls the first (former) order [as a means of expiating sin] so that He might inaugurate and establish the second (latter) order. -- hebrews 10:9
.
And in accordance with this will [of God], we have been made holy (consecrated and sanctified) through the offering made once for all of the body of Jesus Christ (the Anointed One). -- hebrews 10:10
.
Furthermore, every [human] priest stands [at his altar of service] ministering daily, offering the same sacrifices over and over again, which never are able to strip [from every side of us] the sins [that envelop us] and take them away-- -- hebrews 10:11
.
Whereas this One [Christ], after He had offered a single sacrifice for our sins [that shall avail] for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, -- hebrews 10:12
.
Then to wait until His enemies should be made a stool beneath His feet. -- hebrews 10:13
.
For by a single offering He has forever completely cleansed and perfected those who are consecrated and made holy. -- hebrews 10:14
.
And also the Holy Spirit adds His testimony to us [in confirmation of this]. For having said, -- hebrews 10:15
.
This is the agreement (testament, covenant) that I will set up and conclude with them after those days, says the Lord: I will imprint My laws upon their hearts, and I will inscribe them on their minds (on their inmost thoughts and understanding), -- hebrews 10:16
.
He then goes on to say, And their sins and their lawbreaking I will remember no more. -- hebrews 10:17
.
Now where there is absolute remission (forgiveness and cancellation of the penalty) of these [sins and lawbreaking], there is no longer any offering made to atone for sin. -- hebrews 10:18
.
Therefore, brethren, since we have full freedom and confidence to enter into the [Holy of] Holies [by the power and virtue] in the blood of Jesus, -- hebrews 10:19
.
By this fresh (new) and living way which He initiated and dedicated and opened for us through the separating curtain (veil of the Holy of Holies), that is, through His flesh, -- hebrews 10:20
.
And since we have [such] a great and wonderful and noble Priest [Who rules] over the house of God, -- hebrews 10:21
.
Let us all come forward and draw near with true (honest and sincere) hearts in unqualified assurance and absolute conviction engendered by faith (by that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness), having our hearts sprinkled and purified from a guilty (evil) conscience and our bodies cleansed with pure water. -- hebrews 10:22
.
So let us seize and hold fast and retain without wavering the hope we cherish and confess and our acknowledgement of it, for He Who promised is reliable (sure) and faithful to His word. -- hebrews 10:23
.
And let us consider and give attentive, continuous care to watching over one another, studying how we may stir up (stimulate and incite) to love and helpful deeds and noble activities, -- hebrews 10:24
.
Not forsaking or neglecting to assemble together [as believers], as is the habit of some people, but admonishing (warning, urging, and encouraging) one another, and all the more faithfully as you see the day approaching. -- hebrews 10:25
.
For if we go on deliberately and willingly sinning after once acquiring the knowledge of the Truth, there is no longer any sacrifice left to atone for [our] sins [no further offering to which to look forward]. -- hebrews 10:26
.
[There is nothing left for us then] but a kind of awful and fearful prospect and expectation of divine judgment and the fury of burning wrath and indignation which will consume those who put themselves in opposition [to God]. -- hebrews 10:27
.
Any person who has violated and [thus] rejected and set at naught the Law of Moses is put to death without pity or mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. -- hebrews 10:28
.
How much worse (sterner and heavier) punishment do you suppose he will be judged to deserve who has spurned and [thus] trampled underfoot the Son of God, and who has considered the covenant blood by which he was consecrated common and unhallowed, thus profaning it and insulting and outraging the [Holy] Spirit [Who imparts] grace (the unmerited favor and blessing of God)? -- hebrews 10:29
.
For we know Him Who said, Vengeance is Mine [retribution and the meting out of full justice rest with Me]; I will repay [I will exact the compensation], says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge and determine and solve and settle the cause and the cases of His people. -- hebrews 10:30
.
It is a fearful (formidable and terrible) thing to incur the divine penalties and be cast into the hands of the living God! -- hebrews 10:31
.
But be ever mindful of the days gone by in which, after you were first spiritually enlightened, you endured a great and painful struggle, -- hebrews 10:32
.
Sometimes being yourselves a gazingstock, publicly exposed to insults and abuse and distress, and sometimes claiming fellowship and making common cause with others who were so treated. -- hebrews 10:33
.
For you did sympathize and suffer along with those who were imprisoned, and you bore cheerfully the plundering of your belongings and the confiscation of your property, in the knowledge and consciousness that you yourselves had a better and lasting possession. -- hebrews 10:34
.
Do not, therefore, fling away your fearless confidence, for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward. -- hebrews 10:35
.
For you have need of steadfast patience and endurance, so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God, and thus receive and carry away [and enjoy to the full] what is promised. -- hebrews 10:36
.
For still a little while (a very little while), and the Coming One will come and He will not delay. -- hebrews 10:37
.
But the just shall live by faith [My righteous servant shall live by his conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things, and holy fervor born of faith and conjoined with it]; and if he draws back and shrinks in fear, My soul has no delight or pleasure in him. -- hebrews 10:38
.
But our way is not that of those who draw back to eternal misery (perdition) and are utterly destroyed, but we are of those who believe [who cleave to and trust in and rely on God through Jesus Christ, the Messiah] and by faith preserve the soul. -- hebrews 10:39
.
NOW FAITH is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses]. -- hebrews 11:1
.
For by [faith--trust and holy fervor born of faith] the men of old had divine testimony borne to them and obtained a good report. -- hebrews 11:2
.
By faith we understand that the worlds [during the successive ages] were framed (fashioned, put in order, and equipped for their intended purpose) by the word of God, so that what we see was not made out of things which are visible. -- hebrews 11:3
.
[Prompted, actuated] by faith Abel brought God a better and more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, because of which it was testified of him that he was righteous [that he was upright and in right standing with God], and God bore witness by accepting and acknowledging his gifts. And though he died, yet [through the incident] he is still speaking. -- hebrews 11:4
.
Because of faith Enoch was caught up and transferred to heaven, so that he did not have a glimpse of death; and he was not found, because God had translated him. For even before he was taken to heaven, he received testimony [still on record] that he had pleased and been satisfactory to God. -- hebrews 11:5
.
But without faith it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him. For whoever would come near to God must [necessarily] believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him [out]. -- hebrews 11:6
.
[Prompted] by faith Noah, being forewarned by God concerning events of which as yet there was no visible sign, took heed and diligently and reverently constructed and prepared an ark for the deliverance of his own family. By this [his faith which relied on God] he passed judgment and sentence on the world's unbelief and became an heir and possessor of righteousness (that relation of being right into which God puts the person who has faith). -- hebrews 11:7
.
[Urged on] by faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed and went forth to a place which he was destined to receive as an inheritance; and he went, although he did not know or trouble his mind about where he was to go. -- hebrews 11:8
.
[Prompted] by faith he dwelt as a temporary resident in the land which was designated in the promise [of God, though he was like a stranger] in a strange country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs with him of the same promise. -- hebrews 11:9
.
For he was [waiting expectantly and confidently] looking forward to the city which has fixed and firm foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God. -- hebrews 11:10
.
Because of faith also Sarah herself received physical power to conceive a child, even when she was long past the age for it, because she considered [God] Who had given her the promise to be reliable and trustworthy and true to His word. -- hebrews 11:11
.
So from one man, though he was physically as good as dead, there have sprung descendants whose number is as the stars of heaven and as countless as the innumerable sands on the seashore. -- hebrews 11:12
.
These people all died controlled and sustained by their faith, but not having received the tangible fulfillment of [God's] promises, only having seen it and greeted it from a great distance by faith, and all the while acknowledging and confessing that they were strangers and temporary residents and exiles upon the earth. -- hebrews 11:13
.
Now those people who talk as they did show plainly that they are in search of a fatherland (their own country). -- hebrews 11:14
.
If they had been thinking with [homesick] remembrance of that country from which they were emigrants, they would have found constant opportunity to return to it. -- hebrews 11:15
.
But the truth is that they were yearning for and aspiring to a better and more desirable country, that is, a heavenly [one]. For that reason God is not ashamed to be called their God [even to be surnamed their God--the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob], for He has prepared a city for them. -- hebrews 11:16
.
By faith Abraham, when he was put to the test [while the testing of his faith was still in progress], had already brought Isaac for an offering; he who had gladly received and welcomed [God's] promises was ready to sacrifice his only son, -- hebrews 11:17
.
Of whom it was said, Through Isaac shall your descendants be reckoned. -- hebrews 11:18
.
For he reasoned that God was able to raise [him] up even from among the dead. Indeed in the sense that Isaac was figuratively dead [potentially sacrificed], he did [actually] receive him back from the dead. -- hebrews 11:19
.
[With eyes of] faith Isaac, looking far into the future, invoked blessings upon Jacob and Esau. -- hebrews 11:20
.
[Prompted] by faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons and bowed in prayer over the top of his staff. -- hebrews 11:21
.
[Actuated] by faith Joseph, when nearing the end of his life, referred to [the promise of God for] the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his own bones. -- hebrews 11:22
.
[Prompted] by faith Moses, after his birth, was kept concealed for three months by his parents, because they saw how comely the child was; and they were not overawed and terrified by the king's decree. -- hebrews 11:23
.
[Aroused] by faith Moses, when he had grown to maturity and become great, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, -- hebrews 11:24
.
Because he preferred to share the oppression [suffer the hardships] and bear the shame of the people of God rather than to have the fleeting enjoyment of a sinful life. -- hebrews 11:25
.
He considered the contempt and abuse and shame [borne for] the Christ (the Messiah Who was to come) to be greater wealth than all the treasures of Egypt, for he looked forward and away to the reward (recompense). -- hebrews 11:26
.
[Motivated] by faith he left Egypt behind him, being unawed and undismayed by the wrath of the king; for he never flinched but held staunchly to his purpose and endured steadfastly as one who gazed on Him Who is invisible. -- hebrews 11:27
.
By faith (simple trust and confidence in God) he instituted and carried out the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood [on the doorposts], so that the destroyer of the firstborn (the angel) might not touch those [of the children of Israel]. -- hebrews 11:28
.
[Urged on] by faith the people crossed the Red Sea as [though] on dry land, but when the Egyptians tried to do the same thing they were swallowed up [by the sea]. -- hebrews 11:29
.
Because of faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encompassed for seven days [by the Israelites]. -- hebrews 11:30
.
[Prompted] by faith Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed along with those who refused to believe and obey, because she had received the spies in peace [without enmity]. -- hebrews 11:31
.
And what shall I say further? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, -- hebrews 11:32
.
Who by [the help of] faith subdued kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promised blessings, closed the mouths of lions, -- hebrews 11:33
.
Extinguished the power of raging fire, escaped the devourings of the sword, out of frailty and weakness won strength and became stalwart, even mighty and resistless in battle, routing alien hosts. -- hebrews 11:34
.
[Some] women received again their dead by a resurrection. Others were tortured to death with clubs, refusing to accept release [offered on the terms of denying their faith], so that they might be resurrected to a better life. [I Kings 17:17-24; II Kings 4:25-37.] -- hebrews 11:35
.
Others had to suffer the trial of mocking and scourging and even chains and imprisonment. -- hebrews 11:36
.
They were stoned to death; they were lured with tempting offers [to renounce their faith]; they were sawn asunder; they were slaughtered by the sword; [while they were alive] they had to go about wrapped in the skins of sheep and goats, utterly destitute, oppressed, cruelly treated-- -- hebrews 11:37
.
[Men] of whom the world was not worthy--roaming over the desolate places and the mountains, and [living] in caves and caverns and holes of the earth. -- hebrews 11:38
.
And all of these, though they won divine approval by [means of] their faith, did not receive the fulfillment of what was promised, -- hebrews 11:39
.
Because God had us in mind and had something better and greater in view for us, so that they [these heroes and heroines of faith] should not come to perfection apart from us [before we could join them]. -- hebrews 11:40
.
THEREFORE THEN, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses [who have borne testimony to the Truth], let us strip off and throw aside every encumbrance (unnecessary weight) and that sin which so readily (deftly and cleverly) clings to and entangles us, and let us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence the appointed course of the race that is set before us, -- hebrews 12:1
.
Looking away [from all that will distract] to Jesus, Who is the Leader and the Source of our faith [giving the first incentive for our belief] and is also its Finisher [bringing it to maturity and perfection]. He, for the joy [of obtaining the prize] that was set before Him, endured the cross, despising and ignoring the shame, and is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God. -- hebrews 12:2
.
Just think of Him Who endured from sinners such grievous opposition and bitter hostility against Himself [reckon up and consider it all in comparison with your trials], so that you may not grow weary or exhausted, losing heart and relaxing and fainting in your minds. -- hebrews 12:3
.
You have not yet struggled and fought agonizingly against sin, nor have you yet resisted and withstood to the point of pouring out your [own] blood. -- hebrews 12:4
.
And have you [completely] forgotten the divine word of appeal and encouragement in which you are reasoned with and addressed as sons? My son, do not think lightly or scorn to submit to the correction and discipline of the Lord, nor lose courage and give up and faint when you are reproved or corrected by Him; -- hebrews 12:5
.
For the Lord corrects and disciplines everyone whom He loves, and He punishes, even scourges, every son whom He accepts and welcomes to His heart and cherishes. -- hebrews 12:6
.
You must submit to and endure [correction] for discipline; God is dealing with you as with sons. For what son is there whom his father does not [thus] train and correct and discipline? -- hebrews 12:7
.
Now if you are exempt from correction and left without discipline in which all [of God's children] share, then you are illegitimate offspring and not true sons [at all]. -- hebrews 12:8
.
Moreover, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we yielded [to them] and respected [them for training us]. Shall we not much more cheerfully submit to the Father of spirits and so [truly] live? -- hebrews 12:9
.
For [our earthly fathers] disciplined us for only a short period of time and chastised us as seemed proper and good to them; but He disciplines us for our certain good, that we may become sharers in His own holiness. -- hebrews 12:10
.
For the time being no discipline brings joy, but seems grievous and painful; but afterwards it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it [a harvest of fruit which consists in righteousness--in conformity to God's will in purpose, thought, and action, resulting in right living and right standing with God]. -- hebrews 12:11
.
So then, brace up and reinvigorate and set right your slackened and weakened and drooping hands and strengthen your feeble and palsied and tottering knees, -- hebrews 12:12
.
And cut through and make firm and plain and smooth, straight paths for your feet [yes, make them safe and upright and happy paths that go in the right direction], so that the lame and halting [limbs] may not be put out of joint, but rather may be cured. -- hebrews 12:13
.
Strive to live in peace with everybody and pursue that consecration and holiness without which no one will [ever] see the Lord. -- hebrews 12:14
.
Exercise foresight and be on the watch to look [after one another], to see that no one falls back from and fails to secure God's grace (His unmerited favor and spiritual blessing), in order that no root of resentment (rancor, bitterness, or hatred) shoots forth and causes trouble and bitter torment, and the many become contaminated and defiled by it-- -- hebrews 12:15
.
That no one may become guilty of sexual vice, or become a profane (godless and sacrilegious) person as Esau did, who sold his own birthright for a single meal. -- hebrews 12:16
.
For you understand that later on, when he wanted [to regain title to] his inheritance of the blessing, he was rejected (disqualified and set aside), for he could find no opportunity to repair by repentance [what he had done, no chance to recall the choice he had made], although he sought for it carefully with [bitter] tears. -- hebrews 12:17
.
For you have not come [as did the Israelites in the wilderness] to a [material] mountain that can be touched, [a mountain] that is ablaze with fire, and to gloom and darkness and a raging storm, -- hebrews 12:18
.
And to the blast of a trumpet and a voice whose words make the listeners beg that nothing more be said to them. -- hebrews 12:19
.
For they could not bear the command that was given: If even a wild animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death. -- hebrews 12:20
.
In fact, so awful and terrifying was the [phenomenal] sight that Moses said, I am terrified (aghast and trembling with fear). -- hebrews 12:21
.
But rather, you have come to Mount Zion, even to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless multitudes of angels in festal gathering, -- hebrews 12:22
.
And to the church (assembly) of the Firstborn who are registered [as citizens] in heaven, and to the God Who is Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous (the redeemed in heaven) who have been made perfect, -- hebrews 12:23
.
And to Jesus, the Mediator (Go-between, Agent) of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood which speaks [of mercy], a better and nobler and more gracious message than the blood of Abel [which cried out for vengeance]. -- hebrews 12:24
.
So see to it that you do not reject Him or refuse to listen to and heed Him Who is speaking [to you now]. For if they [the Israelites] did not escape when they refused to listen and heed Him Who warned and divinely instructed them [here] on earth [revealing with heavenly warnings His will], how much less shall we escape if we reject and turn our backs on Him Who cautions and admonishes [us] from heaven? -- hebrews 12:25
.
Then [at Mount Sinai] His voice shook the earth, but now He has given a promise: Yet once more I will shake and make tremble not only the earth but also the [starry] heavens. -- hebrews 12:26
.
Now this expression, Yet once more, indicates the final removal and transformation of all [that can be] shaken--that is, of that which has been created--in order that what cannot be shaken may remain and continue. -- hebrews 12:27
.
Let us therefore, receiving a kingdom that is firm and stable and cannot be shaken, offer to God pleasing service and acceptable worship, with modesty and pious care and godly fear and awe; -- hebrews 12:28
.
For our God [is indeed] a consuming fire. -- hebrews 12:29
.
LET LOVE for your fellow believers continue and be a fixed practice with you [never let it fail]. -- hebrews 13:1
.
Do not forget or neglect or refuse to extend hospitality to strangers [in the brotherhood--being friendly, cordial, and gracious, sharing the comforts of your home and doing your part generously], for through it some have entertained angels without knowing it. -- hebrews 13:2
.
Remember those who are in prison as if you were their fellow prisoner, and those who are ill-treated, since you also are liable to bodily sufferings. -- hebrews 13:3
.
Let marriage be held in honor (esteemed worthy, precious, of great price, and especially dear) in all things. And thus let the marriage bed be undefiled (kept undishonored); for God will judge and punish the unchaste [all guilty of sexual vice] and adulterous. -- hebrews 13:4
.
Let your character or moral disposition be free from love of money [including greed, avarice, lust, and craving for earthly possessions] and be satisfied with your present [circumstances and with what you have]; for He [God] Himself has said, I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [you] down (relax My hold on you)! [Assuredly not!] -- hebrews 13:5
.
So we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and boldly say, The Lord is my Helper; I will not be seized with alarm [I will not fear or dread or be terrified]. What can man do to me? -- hebrews 13:6
.
Remember your leaders and superiors in authority [for it was they] who brought to you the Word of God. Observe attentively and consider their manner of living (the outcome of their well-spent lives) and imitate their faith (their conviction that God exists and is the Creator and Ruler of all things, the Provider and Bestower of eternal salvation through Christ, and their leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness). -- hebrews 13:7
.
Jesus Christ (the Messiah) is [always] the same, yesterday, today, [yes] and forever (to the ages). -- hebrews 13:8
.
Do not be carried about by different and varied and alien teachings; for it is good for the heart to be established and ennobled and strengthened by means of grace (God's favor and spiritual blessing) and not [to be devoted to] foods [rules of diet and ritualistic meals], which bring no [spiritual] benefit or profit to those who observe them. -- hebrews 13:9
.
We have an altar from which those who serve and worship in the tabernacle have no right to eat. -- hebrews 13:10
.
For when the blood of animals is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin, the victims' bodies are burned outside the limits of the camp. -- hebrews 13:11
.
Therefore Jesus also suffered and died outside the [city's] gate in order that He might purify and consecrate the people through [the shedding of] His own blood and set them apart as holy [for God]. -- hebrews 13:12
.
Let us then go forth [from all that would prevent us] to Him outside the camp [at Calvary], bearing the contempt and abuse and shame with Him. -- hebrews 13:13
.
For here we have no permanent city, but we are looking for the one which is to come. -- hebrews 13:14
.
Through Him, therefore, let us constantly and at all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise, which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge and confess and glorify His name. -- hebrews 13:15
.
Do not forget or neglect to do kindness and good, to be generous and distribute and contribute to the needy [of the church as embodiment and proof of fellowship], for such sacrifices are pleasing to God. -- hebrews 13:16
.
Obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them [continually recognizing their authority over you], for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls and guarding your spiritual welfare, as men who will have to render an account [of their trust]. [Do your part to] let them do this with gladness and not with sighing and groaning, for that would not be profitable to you [either]. -- hebrews 13:17
.
Keep praying for us, for we are convinced that we have a good (clear) conscience, that we want to walk uprightly and live a noble life, acting honorably and in complete honesty in all things. -- hebrews 13:18
.
And I beg of you [to pray for us] the more earnestly, in order that I may be restored to you the sooner. -- hebrews 13:19
.
Now may the God of peace [Who is the Author and the Giver of peace], Who brought again from among the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood [that sealed, ratified] the everlasting agreement (covenant, testament), -- hebrews 13:20
.
Strengthen (complete, perfect) and make you what you ought to be and equip you with everything good that you may carry out His will; [while He Himself] works in you and accomplishes that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ (the Messiah); to Whom be the glory forever and ever (to the ages of the ages). Amen (so be it). -- hebrews 13:21
.
I call on you, brethren, to listen patiently and bear with this message of exhortation and admonition and encouragement, for I have written to you briefly. -- hebrews 13:22
.
Notice that our brother Timothy has been released [from prison]. If he comes here soon, I will see you along with him. -- hebrews 13:23
.
Give our greetings to all of your spiritual leaders and to all of the saints (God's consecrated believers). The Italian Christians send you their greetings [also]. -- hebrews 13:24
.
Grace (God's favor and spiritual blessing) be with you all. Amen (so be it). -- hebrews 13:25
.
JAMES, A servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes scattered abroad [among the Gentiles in the dispersion]: Greetings (rejoice)! -- james 1:1
.
Consider it wholly joyful, my brethren, whenever you are enveloped in or encounter trials of any sort or fall into various temptations. -- james 1:2
.
Be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your faith bring out endurance and steadfastness and patience. -- james 1:3
.
But let endurance and steadfastness and patience have full play and do a thorough work, so that you may be [people] perfectly and fully developed [with no defects], lacking in nothing. -- james 1:4
.
If any of you is deficient in wisdom, let him ask of the giving God [Who gives] to everyone liberally and ungrudgingly, without reproaching or faultfinding, and it will be given him. -- james 1:5
.
Only it must be in faith that he asks with no wavering (no hesitating, no doubting). For the one who wavers (hesitates, doubts) is like the billowing surge out at sea that is blown hither and thither and tossed by the wind. -- james 1:6
.
For truly, let not such a person imagine that he will receive anything [he asks for] from the Lord, -- james 1:7
.
[For being as he is] a man of two minds (hesitating, dubious, irresolute), [he is] unstable and unreliable and uncertain about everything [he thinks, feels, decides]. -- james 1:8
.
Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his elevation [as a Christian, called to the true riches and to be an heir of God], -- james 1:9
.
And the rich [person ought to glory] in being humbled [by being shown his human frailty], because like the flower of the grass he will pass away. -- james 1:10
.
For the sun comes up with a scorching heat and parches the grass; its flower falls off and its beauty fades away. Even so will the rich man wither and die in the midst of his pursuits. -- james 1:11
.
Blessed (happy, to be envied) is the man who is patient under trial and stands up under temptation, for when he has stood the test and been approved, he will receive [the victor's] crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him. -- james 1:12
.
Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted from God; for God is incapable of being tempted by [what is] evil and He Himself tempts no one. -- james 1:13
.
But every person is tempted when he is drawn away, enticed and baited by his own evil desire (lust, passions). -- james 1:14
.
Then the evil desire, when it has conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is fully matured, brings forth death. -- james 1:15
.
Do not be misled, my beloved brethren. -- james 1:16
.
Every good gift and every perfect (free, large, full) gift is from above; it comes down from the Father of all [that gives] light, in [the shining of] Whom there can be no variation [rising or setting] or shadow cast by His turning [as in an eclipse]. -- james 1:17
.
And it was of His own [free] will that He gave us birth [as sons] by [His] Word of Truth, so that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures [a sample of what He created to be consecrated to Himself]. -- james 1:18
.
Understand [this], my beloved brethren. Let every man be quick to hear [a ready listener], slow to speak, slow to take offense and to get angry. -- james 1:19
.
For man's anger does not promote the righteousness God [wishes and requires]. -- james 1:20
.
So get rid of all uncleanness and the rampant outgrowth of wickedness, and in a humble (gentle, modest) spirit receive and welcome the Word which implanted and rooted [in your hearts] contains the power to save your souls. -- james 1:21
.
But be doers of the Word [obey the message], and not merely listeners to it, betraying yourselves [into deception by reasoning contrary to the Truth]. -- james 1:22
.
For if anyone only listens to the Word without obeying it and being a doer of it, he is like a man who looks carefully at his [own] natural face in a mirror; -- james 1:23
.
For he thoughtfully observes himself, and then goes off and promptly forgets what he was like. -- james 1:24
.
But he who looks carefully into the faultless law, the [law] of liberty, and is faithful to it and perseveres in looking into it, being not a heedless listener who forgets but an active doer [who obeys], he shall be blessed in his doing (his life of obedience). -- james 1:25
.
If anyone thinks himself to be religious (piously observant of the external duties of his faith) and does not bridle his tongue but deludes his own heart, this person's religious service is worthless (futile, barren). -- james 1:26
.
External religious worship [religion as it is expressed in outward acts] that is pure and unblemished in the sight of God the Father is this: to visit and help and care for the orphans and widows in their affliction and need, and to keep oneself unspotted and uncontaminated from the world. -- james 1:27
.
MY BRETHREN, pay no servile regard to people [show no prejudice, no partiality]. Do not [attempt to] hold and practice the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ [the Lord] of glory [together with snobbery]! -- james 2:1
.
For if a person comes into your congregation whose hands are adorned with gold rings and who is wearing splendid apparel, and also a poor [man] in shabby clothes comes in, -- james 2:2
.
And you pay special attention to the one who wears the splendid clothes and say to him, Sit here in this preferable seat! while you tell the poor [man], Stand there! or, Sit there on the floor at my feet! -- james 2:3
.
Are you not discriminating among your own and becoming critics and judges with wrong motives? -- james 2:4
.
Listen, my beloved brethren: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and in their position as believers and to inherit the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him? -- james 2:5
.
But you [in contrast] have insulted (humiliated, dishonored, and shown your contempt for) the poor. Is it not the rich who domineer over you? Is it not they who drag you into the law courts? -- james 2:6
.
Is it not they who slander and blaspheme that precious name by which you are distinguished and called [the name of Christ invoked in baptism]? -- james 2:7
.
If indeed you [really] fulfill the royal Law in accordance with the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as [you love] yourself, you do well. -- james 2:8
.
But if you show servile regard (prejudice, favoritism) for people, you commit sin and are rebuked and convicted by the Law as violators and offenders. -- james 2:9
.
For whosoever keeps the Law [as a] whole but stumbles and offends in one [single instance] has become guilty of [breaking] all of it. -- james 2:10
.
For He Who said, You shall not commit adultery, also said, You shall not kill. If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become guilty of transgressing the [whole] Law. -- james 2:11
.
So speak and so act as [people should] who are to be judged under the law of liberty [the moral instruction given by Christ, especially about love]. -- james 2:12
.
For to him who has shown no mercy the judgment [will be] merciless, but mercy [full of glad confidence] exults victoriously over judgment. -- james 2:13
.
What is the use (profit), my brethren, for anyone to profess to have faith if he has no [good] works [to show for it]? Can [such] faith save [his soul]? -- james 2:14
.
If a brother or sister is poorly clad and lacks food for each day, -- james 2:15
.
And one of you says to him, Good-bye! Keep [yourself] warm and well fed, without giving him the necessities for the body, what good does that do? -- james 2:16
.
So also faith, if it does not have works (deeds and actions of obedience to back it up), by itself is destitute of power (inoperative, dead). -- james 2:17
.
But someone will say [to you then], You [say you] have faith, and I have [good] works. Now you show me your [alleged] faith apart from any [good] works [if you can], and I by [good] works [of obedience] will show you my faith. -- james 2:18
.
You believe that God is one; you do well. So do the demons believe and shudder [in terror and horror such as make a man's hair stand on end and contract the surface of his skin]! -- james 2:19
.
Are you willing to be shown [proof], you foolish (unproductive, spiritually deficient) fellow, that faith apart from [good] works is inactive and ineffective and worthless? -- james 2:20
.
Was not our forefather Abraham [shown to be] justified (made acceptable to God) by [his] works when he brought to the altar as an offering his [own] son Isaac? -- james 2:21
.
You see that [his] faith was cooperating with his works, and [his] faith was completed and reached its supreme expression [when he implemented it] by [good] works. -- james 2:22
.
And [so] the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed in (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on) God, and this was accounted to him as righteousness (as conformity to God's will in thought and deed), and he was called God's friend. -- james 2:23
.
You see that a man is justified (pronounced righteous before God) through what he does and not alone through faith [through works of obedience as well as by what he believes]. -- james 2:24
.
So also with Rahab the harlot--was she not shown to be justified (pronounced righteous before God) by [good] deeds when she took in the scouts (spies) and sent them away by a different route? -- james 2:25
.
For as the human body apart from the spirit is lifeless, so faith apart from [its] works of obedience is also dead. -- james 2:26
.
NOT MANY [of you] should become teachers (self-constituted censors and reprovers of others), my brethren, for you know that we [teachers] will be judged by a higher standard and with greater severity [than other people; thus we assume the greater accountability and the more condemnation]. -- james 3:1
.
For we all often stumble and fall and offend in many things. And if anyone does not offend in speech [never says the wrong things], he is a fully developed character and a perfect man, able to control his whole body and to curb his entire nature. -- james 3:2
.
If we set bits in the horses' mouths to make them obey us, we can turn their whole bodies about. -- james 3:3
.
Likewise, look at the ships: though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines. -- james 3:4
.
Even so the tongue is a little member, and it can boast of great things. See how much wood or how great a forest a tiny spark can set ablaze! -- james 3:5
.
And the tongue is a fire. [The tongue is a] world of wickedness set among our members, contaminating and depraving the whole body and setting on fire the wheel of birth (the cycle of man's nature), being itself ignited by hell (Gehenna). -- james 3:6
.
For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea animal, can be tamed and has been tamed by human genius (nature). -- james 3:7
.
But the human tongue can be tamed by no man. It is a restless (undisciplined, irreconcilable) evil, full of deadly poison. -- james 3:8
.
With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who were made in God's likeness! -- james 3:9
.
Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brethren, ought not to be so. -- james 3:10
.
Does a fountain send forth [simultaneously] from the same opening fresh water and bitter? -- james 3:11
.
Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine figs? Neither can a salt spring furnish fresh water. -- james 3:12
.
Who is there among you who is wise and intelligent? Then let him by his noble living show forth his [good] works with the [unobtrusive] humility [which is the proper attribute] of true wisdom. -- james 3:13
.
But if you have bitter jealousy (envy) and contention (rivalry, selfish ambition) in your hearts, do not pride yourselves on it and thus be in defiance of and false to the Truth. -- james 3:14
.
This [superficial] wisdom is not such as comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual (animal), even devilish (demoniacal). -- james 3:15
.
For wherever there is jealousy (envy) and contention (rivalry and selfish ambition), there will also be confusion (unrest, disharmony, rebellion) and all sorts of evil and vile practices. -- james 3:16
.
But the wisdom from above is first of all pure (undefiled); then it is peace-loving, courteous (considerate, gentle). [It is willing to] yield to reason, full of compassion and good fruits; it is wholehearted and straightforward, impartial and unfeigned (free from doubts, wavering, and insincerity). -- james 3:17
.
And the harvest of righteousness (of conformity to God's will in thought and deed) is [the fruit of the seed] sown in peace by those who work for and make peace [in themselves and in others, that peace which means concord, agreement, and harmony between individuals, with undisturbedness, in a peaceful mind free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts]. -- james 3:18
.
WHAT LEADS to strife (discord and feuds) and how do conflicts (quarrels and fightings) originate among you? Do they not arise from your sensual desires that are ever warring in your bodily members? -- james 4:1
.
You are jealous and covet [what others have] and your desires go unfulfilled; [so] you become murderers. [To hate is to murder as far as your hearts are concerned.] You burn with envy and anger and are not able to obtain [the gratification, the contentment, and the happiness that you seek], so you fight and war. You do not have, because you do not ask. [I John 3:15.] -- james 4:2
.
[Or] you do ask [God for them] and yet fail to receive, because you ask with wrong purpose and evil, selfish motives. Your intention is [when you get what you desire] to spend it in sensual pleasures. -- james 4:3
.
You [are like] unfaithful wives [having illicit love affairs with the world and breaking your marriage vow to God]! Do you not know that being the world's friend is being God's enemy? So whoever chooses to be a friend of the world takes his stand as an enemy of God. -- james 4:4
.
Or do you suppose that the Scripture is speaking to no purpose that says, The Spirit Whom He has caused to dwell in us yearns over us and He yearns for the Spirit [to be welcome] with a jealous love? -- james 4:5
.
But He gives us more and more grace (power of the Holy Spirit, to meet this evil tendency and all others fully). That is why He says, God sets Himself against the proud and haughty, but gives grace [continually] to the lowly (those who are humble enough to receive it). -- james 4:6
.
So be subject to God. Resist the devil [stand firm against him], and he will flee from you. -- james 4:7
.
Come close to God and He will come close to you. [Recognize that you are] sinners, get your soiled hands clean; [realize that you have been disloyal] wavering individuals with divided interests, and purify your hearts [of your spiritual adultery]. -- james 4:8
.
[As you draw near to God] be deeply penitent and grieve, even weep [over your disloyalty]. Let your laughter be turned to grief and your mirth to dejection and heartfelt shame [for your sins]. -- james 4:9
.
Humble yourselves [feeling very insignificant] in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you [He will lift you up and make your lives significant]. -- james 4:10
.
[My] brethren, do not speak evil about or accuse one another. He that maligns a brother or judges his brother is maligning and criticizing the Law and judging the Law. But if you judge the Law, you are not a practicer of the Law but a censor and judge [of it]. -- james 4:11
.
One only is the Lawgiver and Judge Who is able to save and to destroy [the One Who has the absolute power of life and death]. [But you] who are you that [you presume to] pass judgment on your neighbor? -- james 4:12
.
Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a city and spend a year there and carry on our business and make money. -- james 4:13
.
Yet you do not know [the least thing] about what may happen tomorrow. What is the nature of your life? You are [really] but a wisp of vapor (a puff of smoke, a mist) that is visible for a little while and then disappears [into thin air]. -- james 4:14
.
You ought instead to say, If the Lord is willing, we shall live and we shall do this or that [thing]. -- james 4:15
.
But as it is, you boast [falsely] in your presumption and your self-conceit. All such boasting is wrong. -- james 4:16
.
So any person who knows what is right to do but does not do it, to him it is sin. -- james 4:17
.
COME NOW, you rich [people], weep aloud and lament over the miseries (the woes) that are surely coming upon you. -- james 5:1
.
Your abundant wealth has rotted and is ruined, and your [many] garments have become moth-eaten. -- james 5:2
.
Your gold and silver are completely rusted through, and their rust will be testimony against you and it will devour your flesh as if it were fire. You have heaped together treasure for the last days. -- james 5:3
.
[But] look! [Here are] the wages that you have withheld by fraud from the laborers who have reaped your fields, crying out [for vengeance]; and the cries of the harvesters have come to the ears of the Lord of hosts. -- james 5:4
.
[Here] on earth you have abandoned yourselves to soft (prodigal) living and to [the pleasures of] self-indulgence and self-gratification. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. -- james 5:5
.
You have condemned and have murdered the righteous (innocent man), [while] he offers no resistance to you. -- james 5:6
.
So be patient, brethren, [as you wait] till the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits expectantly for the precious harvest from the land. [See how] he keeps up his patient [vigil] over it until it receives the early and late rains. -- james 5:7
.
So you also must be patient. Establish your hearts [strengthen and confirm them in the final certainty], for the coming of the Lord is very near. -- james 5:8
.
Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you [yourselves] may not be judged. Look! The Judge is [already] standing at the very door. -- james 5:9
.
[As] an example of suffering and ill-treatment together with patience, brethren, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord [as His messengers]. -- james 5:10
.
You know how we call those blessed (happy) who were steadfast [who endured]. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the Lord's [purpose and how He richly blessed him in the] end, inasmuch as the Lord is full of pity and compassion and tenderness and mercy. -- james 5:11
.
But above all [things], my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath; but let your yes be [a simple] yes, and your no be [a simple] no, so that you may not sin and fall under condemnation. -- james 5:12
.
Is anyone among you afflicted (ill-treated, suffering evil)? He should pray. Is anyone glad at heart? He should sing praise [to God]. -- james 5:13
.
Is anyone among you sick? He should call in the church elders (the spiritual guides). And they should pray over him, anointing him with oil in the Lord's name. -- james 5:14
.
And the prayer [that is] of faith will save him who is sick, and the Lord will restore him; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. -- james 5:15
.
Confess to one another therefore your faults (your slips, your false steps, your offenses, your sins) and pray [also] for one another, that you may be healed and restored [to a spiritual tone of mind and heart]. The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]. -- james 5:16
.
Elijah was a human being with a nature such as we have [with feelings, affections, and a constitution like ours]; and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, and no rain fell on the earth for three years and six months. [I Kings 17:1.] -- james 5:17
.
And [then] he prayed again and the heavens supplied rain and the land produced its crops [as usual]. [I Kings 18:42-45.] -- james 5:18
.
[My] brethren, if anyone among you strays from the Truth and falls into error and another [person] brings him back [to God], -- james 5:19
.
Let the [latter] one be sure that whoever turns a sinner from his evil course will save [that one's] soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins [procure the pardon of the many sins committed by the convert]. -- james 5:20
.
PETER, AN apostle (a special messenger) of Jesus Christ, [writing] to the elect exiles of the dispersion scattered (sowed) abroad in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, -- 1 peter 1:1
.
Who were chosen and foreknown by God the Father and consecrated (sanctified, made holy) by the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and to be sprinkled with [His] blood: May grace (spiritual blessing) and peace be given you in increasing abundance [that spiritual peace to be realized in and through Christ, freedom from fears, agitating passions, and moral conflicts]. -- 1 peter 1:2
.
Praised (honored, blessed) be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah)! By His boundless mercy we have been born again to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, -- 1 peter 1:3
.
[Born anew] into an inheritance which is beyond the reach of change and decay [imperishable], unsullied and unfading, reserved in heaven for you, -- 1 peter 1:4
.
Who are being guarded (garrisoned) by God's power through [your] faith [till you fully inherit that final] salvation that is ready to be revealed [for you] in the last time. -- 1 peter 1:5
.
[You should] be exceedingly glad on this account, though now for a little while you may be distressed by trials and suffer temptations, -- 1 peter 1:6
.
So that [the genuineness] of your faith may be tested, [your faith] which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire. [This proving of your faith is intended] to redound to [your] praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) is revealed. -- 1 peter 1:7
.
Without having seen Him, you love Him; though you do not [even] now see Him, you believe in Him and exult and thrill with inexpressible and glorious (triumphant, heavenly) joy. -- 1 peter 1:8
.
[At the same time] you receive the result (outcome, consummation) of your faith, the salvation of your souls. -- 1 peter 1:9
.
The prophets, who prophesied of the grace (divine blessing) which was intended for you, searched and inquired earnestly about this salvation. -- 1 peter 1:10
.
They sought [to find out] to whom or when this was to come which the Spirit of Christ working within them was indicating when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow [them]. -- 1 peter 1:11
.
It was then disclosed to them that the services they were rendering were not meant for themselves and their period of time, but for you. [It is these very] things which have now already been made known plainly to you by those who preached the good news (the Gospel) to you by the [same] Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Into these things [the very] angels long to look! -- 1 peter 1:12
.
So brace up your minds; be sober (circumspect, morally alert); set your hope wholly and unchangeably on the grace (divine favor) that is coming to you when Jesus Christ (the Messiah) is revealed. -- 1 peter 1:13
.
[Live] as children of obedience [to God]; do not conform yourselves to the evil desires [that governed you] in your former ignorance [when you did not know the requirements of the Gospel]. -- 1 peter 1:14
.
But as the One Who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all your conduct and manner of living. -- 1 peter 1:15
.
For it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. -- 1 peter 1:16
.
And if you call upon Him as [your] Father Who judges each one impartially according to what he does, [then] you should conduct yourselves with true reverence throughout the time of your temporary residence [on the earth, whether long or short]. -- 1 peter 1:17
.
You must know (recognize) that you were redeemed (ransomed) from the useless (fruitless) way of living inherited by tradition from [your] forefathers, not with corruptible things [such as] silver and gold, -- 1 peter 1:18
.
But [you were purchased] with the precious blood of Christ (the Messiah), like that of a [sacrificial] lamb without blemish or spot. -- 1 peter 1:19
.
It is true that He was chosen and foreordained (destined and foreknown for it) before the foundation of the world, but He was brought out to public view (made manifest) in these last days (at the end of the times) for the sake of you. -- 1 peter 1:20
.
Through Him you believe in (adhere to, rely on) God, Who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him honor and glory, so that your faith and hope are [centered and rest] in God. -- 1 peter 1:21
.
Since by your obedience to the Truth through the [Holy ] Spirit you have purified your hearts for the sincere affection of the brethren, [see that you] love one another fervently from a pure heart. -- 1 peter 1:22
.
You have been regenerated (born again), not from a mortal origin (seed, sperm), but from one that is immortal by the ever living and lasting Word of God. -- 1 peter 1:23
.
For all flesh (mankind) is like grass, and all its glory (honor) like [the] flower of grass. The grass withers and the flower drops off, -- 1 peter 1:24
.
But the Word of the Lord (divine instruction, the Gospel) endures forever. And this Word is the good news which was preached to you. -- 1 peter 1:25
.
SO BE done with every trace of wickedness (depravity, malignity) and all deceit and insincerity (pretense, hypocrisy) and grudges (envy, jealousy) and slander and evil speaking of every kind. -- 1 peter 2:1
.
Like newborn babies you should crave (thirst for, earnestly desire) the pure (unadulterated) spiritual milk, that by it you may be nurtured and grow unto [completed] salvation, -- 1 peter 2:2
.
Since you have [already] tasted the goodness and kindness of the Lord. -- 1 peter 2:3
.
Come to Him [then, to that] Living Stone which men tried and threw away, but which is chosen [and] precious in God's sight. -- 1 peter 2:4
.
[Come] and, like living stones, be yourselves built [into] a spiritual house, for a holy (dedicated, consecrated) priesthood, to offer up [those] spiritual sacrifices [that are] acceptable and pleasing to God through Jesus Christ. -- 1 peter 2:5
.
For thus it stands in Scripture: Behold, I am laying in Zion a chosen (honored), precious chief Cornerstone, and he who believes in Him [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him] shall never be disappointed or put to shame. -- 1 peter 2:6
.
To you then who believe (who adhere to, trust in, and rely on Him) is the preciousness; but for those who disbelieve [it is true], The [very] Stone which the builders rejected has become the main Cornerstone, -- 1 peter 2:7
.
And, A Stone that will cause stumbling and a Rock that will give [men] offense; they stumble because they disobey and disbelieve [God's] Word, as those [who reject Him] were destined (appointed) to do. -- 1 peter 2:8
.
But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God's] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. -- 1 peter 2:9
.
Once you were not a people [at all], but now you are God's people; once you were unpitied, but now you are pitied and have received mercy. -- 1 peter 2:10
.
Beloved, I implore you as aliens and strangers and exiles [in this world] to abstain from the sensual urges (the evil desires, the passions of the flesh, your lower nature) that wage war against the soul. -- 1 peter 2:11
.
Conduct yourselves properly (honorably, righteously) among the Gentiles, so that, although they may slander you as evildoers, [yet] they may by witnessing your good deeds [come to] glorify God in the day of inspection [when God shall look upon you wanderers as a pastor or shepherd looks over his flock]. -- 1 peter 2:12
.
Be submissive to every human institution and authority for the sake of the Lord, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, -- 1 peter 2:13
.
Or to governors as sent by him to bring vengeance (punishment, justice) to those who do wrong and to encourage those who do good service. -- 1 peter 2:14
.
For it is God's will and intention that by doing right [your good and honest lives] should silence (muzzle, gag) the ignorant charges and ill-informed criticisms of foolish persons. -- 1 peter 2:15
.
[Live] as free people, [yet] without employing your freedom as a pretext for wickedness; but [live at all times] as servants of God. -- 1 peter 2:16
.
Show respect for all men [treat them honorably]. Love the brotherhood (the Christian fraternity of which Christ is the Head). Reverence God. Honor the emperor. -- 1 peter 2:17
.
[You who are] household servants, be submissive to your masters with all [proper] respect, not only to those who are kind and considerate and reasonable, but also to those who are surly (overbearing, unjust, and crooked). -- 1 peter 2:18
.
For one is regarded favorably (is approved, acceptable, and thankworthy) if, as in the sight of God, he endures the pain of unjust suffering. -- 1 peter 2:19
.
[After all] what kind of glory [is there in it] if, when you do wrong and are punished for it, you take it patiently? But if you bear patiently with suffering [which results] when you do right and that is undeserved, it is acceptable and pleasing to God. -- 1 peter 2:20
.
For even to this were you called [it is inseparable from your vocation]. For Christ also suffered for you, leaving you [His personal] example, so that you should follow in His footsteps. -- 1 peter 2:21
.
He was guilty of no sin, neither was deceit (guile) ever found on His lips. -- 1 peter 2:22
.
When He was reviled and insulted, He did not revile or offer insult in return; [when] He was abused and suffered, He made no threats [of vengeance]; but he trusted [Himself and everything] to Him Who judges fairly. -- 1 peter 2:23
.
He personally bore our sins in His [own] body on the tree [as on an altar and offered Himself on it], that we might die (cease to exist) to sin and live to righteousness. By His wounds you have been healed. -- 1 peter 2:24
.
For you were going astray like [so many] sheep, but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Guardian (the Bishop) of your souls. -- 1 peter 2:25
.
IN LIKE manner, you married women, be submissive to your own husbands [subordinate yourselves as being secondary to and dependent on them, and adapt yourselves to them], so that even if any do not obey the Word [of God], they may be won over not by discussion but by the [godly] lives of their wives, -- 1 peter 3:1
.
When they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves, together with your reverence [for your husband; you are to feel for him all that reverence includes: to respect, defer to, revere him--to honor, esteem, appreciate, prize, and, in the human sense, to adore him, that is, to admire, praise, be devoted to, deeply love, and enjoy your husband]. -- 1 peter 3:2
.
Let not yours be the [merely] external adorning with [elaborate] interweaving and knotting of the hair, the wearing of jewelry, or changes of clothes; -- 1 peter 3:3
.
But let it be the inward adorning and beauty of the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible and unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit, which [is not anxious or wrought up, but] is very precious in the sight of God. -- 1 peter 3:4
.
For it was thus that the pious women of old who hoped in God were [accustomed] to beautify themselves and were submissive to their husbands [adapting themselves to them as themselves secondary and dependent upon them]. -- 1 peter 3:5
.
It was thus that Sarah obeyed Abraham [following his guidance and acknowledging his headship over her by] calling him lord (master, leader, authority). And you are now her true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you [not giving way to hysterical fears or letting anxieties unnerve you]. -- 1 peter 3:6
.
In the same way you married men should live considerately with [your wives], with an intelligent recognition [of the marriage relation], honoring the woman as [physically] the weaker, but [realizing that you] are joint heirs of the grace (God's unmerited favor) of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered and cut off. [Otherwise you cannot pray effectively.] -- 1 peter 3:7
.
Finally, all [of you] should be of one and the same mind (united in spirit), sympathizing [with one another], loving [each other] as brethren [of one household], compassionate and courteous (tenderhearted and humble). -- 1 peter 3:8
.
Never return evil for evil or insult for insult (scolding, tongue-lashing, berating), but on the contrary blessing [praying for their welfare, happiness, and protection, and truly pitying and loving them]. For know that to this you have been called, that you may yourselves inherit a blessing [from God--that you may obtain a blessing as heirs, bringing welfare and happiness and protection]. -- 1 peter 3:9
.
For let him who wants to enjoy life and see good days [good--whether apparent or not] keep his tongue free from evil and his lips from guile (treachery, deceit). -- 1 peter 3:10
.
Let him turn away from wickedness and shun it, and let him do right. Let him search for peace (harmony; undisturbedness from fears, agitating passions, and moral conflicts) and seek it eagerly. [Do not merely desire peaceful relations with God, with your fellowmen, and with yourself, but pursue, go after them!] -- 1 peter 3:11
.
For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God), and His ears are attentive to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who practice evil [to oppose them, to frustrate, and defeat them]. -- 1 peter 3:12
.
Now who is there to hurt you if you are zealous followers of that which is good? -- 1 peter 3:13
.
But even in case you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, [you are] blessed (happy, to be envied). Do not dread or be afraid of their threats, nor be disturbed [by their opposition]. -- 1 peter 3:14
.
But in your hearts set Christ apart as holy [and acknowledge Him] as Lord. Always be ready to give a logical defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope that is in you, but do it courteously and respectfully. -- 1 peter 3:15
.
[And see to it that] your conscience is entirely clear (unimpaired), so that, when you are falsely accused as evildoers, those who threaten you abusively and revile your right behavior in Christ may come to be ashamed [of slandering your good lives]. -- 1 peter 3:16
.
For [it is] better to suffer [unjustly] for doing right, if that should be God's will, than to suffer [justly] for doing wrong. -- 1 peter 3:17
.
For Christ [the Messiah Himself] died for sins once for all, the Righteous for the unrighteous (the Just for the unjust, the Innocent for the guilty), that He might bring us to God. In His human body He was put to death, but He was made alive in the spirit, -- 1 peter 3:18
.
In which He went and preached to the spirits in prison, -- 1 peter 3:19
.
[The souls of those] who long before in the days of Noah had been disobedient, when God's patience waited during the building of the ark in which a few [people], actually eight in number, were saved through water. -- 1 peter 3:20
.
And baptism, which is a figure [of their deliverance], does now also save you [from inward questionings and fears], not by the removing of outward body filth [bathing], but by [providing you with] the answer of a good and clear conscience (inward cleanness and peace) before God [because you are demonstrating what you believe to be yours] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. -- 1 peter 3:21
.
[And He] has now entered into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with [all] angels and authorities and powers made subservient to Him. -- 1 peter 3:22
.
SO, SINCE Christ suffered in the flesh for us, for you, arm yourselves with the same thought and purpose [patiently to suffer rather than fail to please God]. For whoever has suffered in the flesh [having the mind of Christ] is done with [intentional] sin [has stopped pleasing himself and the world, and pleases God], -- 1 peter 4:1
.
So that he can no longer spend the rest of his natural life living by [his] human appetites and desires, but [he lives] for what God wills. -- 1 peter 4:2
.
For the time that is past already suffices for doing what the Gentiles like to do--living [as you have done] in shameless, insolent wantonness, in lustful desires, drunkenness, reveling, drinking bouts and abominable, lawless idolatries. -- 1 peter 4:3
.
They are astonished and think it very queer that you do not now run hand in hand with them in the same excesses of dissipation, and they abuse [you]. -- 1 peter 4:4
.
But they will have to give an account to Him Who is ready to judge and pass sentence on the living and the dead. -- 1 peter 4:5
.
For this is why the good news (the Gospel) was preached [in their lifetime] even to the dead, that though judged in fleshly bodies as men are, they might live in the spirit as God does. -- 1 peter 4:6
.
But the end and culmination of all things has now come near; keep sound minded and self-restrained and alert therefore for [the practice of] prayer. -- 1 peter 4:7
.
Above all things have intense and unfailing love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins [forgives and disregards the offenses of others]. -- 1 peter 4:8
.
Practice hospitality to one another (those of the household of faith). [Be hospitable, be a lover of strangers, with brotherly affection for the unknown guests, the foreigners, the poor, and all others who come your way who are of Christ's body.] And [in each instance] do it ungrudgingly (cordially and graciously, without complaining but as representing Him). -- 1 peter 4:9
.
As each of you has received a gift (a particular spiritual talent, a gracious divine endowment), employ it for one another as [befits] good trustees of God's many-sided grace [faithful stewards of the extremely diverse powers and gifts granted to Christians by unmerited favor]. -- 1 peter 4:10
.
Whoever speaks, [let him do it as one who utters] oracles of God; whoever renders service, [let him do it] as with the strength which God furnishes abundantly, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ (the Messiah). To Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever (through endless ages). Amen (so be it). -- 1 peter 4:11
.
Beloved, do not be amazed and bewildered at the fiery ordeal which is taking place to test your quality, as though something strange (unusual and alien to you and your position) were befalling you. -- 1 peter 4:12
.
But insofar as you are sharing Christ's sufferings, rejoice, so that when His glory [full of radiance and splendor] is revealed, you may also rejoice with triumph [exultantly]. -- 1 peter 4:13
.
If you are censured and suffer abuse [because you bear] the name of Christ, blessed [are you--happy, fortunate, to be envied, with life-joy, and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of your outward condition], because the Spirit of glory, the Spirit of God, is resting upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. -- 1 peter 4:14
.
But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or any sort of criminal, or as a mischief-maker (a meddler) in the affairs of others [infringing on their rights]. -- 1 peter 4:15
.
But if [one is ill-treated and suffers] as a Christian [which he is contemptuously called], let him not be ashamed, but give glory to God that he is [deemed worthy to suffer] in this name. -- 1 peter 4:16
.
For the time [has arrived] for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will [be] the end of those who do not respect or believe or obey the good news (the Gospel) of God? -- 1 peter 4:17
.
And if the righteous are barely saved, what will become of the godless and wicked? -- 1 peter 4:18
.
Therefore, those who are ill-treated and suffer in accordance with God's will must do right and commit their souls [in charge as a deposit] to the One Who created [them] and will never fail [them]. -- 1 peter 4:19
.
I WARN and counsel the elders among you (the pastors and spiritual guides of the church) as a fellow elder and as an eyewitness [called to testify] of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a sharer in the glory (the honor and splendor) that is to be revealed (disclosed, unfolded): -- 1 peter 5:1
.
Tend (nurture, guard, guide, and fold) the flock of God that is [your responsibility], not by coercion or constraint, but willingly; not dishonorably motivated by the advantages and profits [belonging to the office], but eagerly and cheerfully; -- 1 peter 5:2
.
Not domineering [as arrogant, dictatorial, and overbearing persons] over those in your charge, but being examples (patterns and models of Christian living) to the flock (the congregation). -- 1 peter 5:3
.
And [then] when the Chief Shepherd is revealed, you will win the conqueror's crown of glory. -- 1 peter 5:4
.
Likewise, you who are younger and of lesser rank, be subject to the elders (the ministers and spiritual guides of the church)--[giving them due respect and yielding to their counsel]. Clothe (apron) yourselves, all of you, with humility [as the garb of a servant, so that its covering cannot possibly be stripped from you, with freedom from pride and arrogance] toward one another. For God sets Himself against the proud (the insolent, the overbearing, the disdainful, the presumptuous, the boastful)--[and He opposes, frustrates, and defeats them], but gives grace (favor, blessing) to the humble. -- 1 peter 5:5
.
Therefore humble yourselves [demote, lower yourselves in your own estimation] under the mighty hand of God, that in due time He may exalt you, -- 1 peter 5:6
.
Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully. -- 1 peter 5:7
.
Be well balanced (temperate, sober of mind), be vigilant and cautious at all times; for that enemy of yours, the devil, roams around like a lion roaring [in fierce hunger], seeking someone to seize upon and devour. -- 1 peter 5:8
.
Withstand him; be firm in faith [against his onset--rooted, established, strong, immovable, and determined], knowing that the same (identical) sufferings are appointed to your brotherhood (the whole body of Christians) throughout the world. -- 1 peter 5:9
.
And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace [Who imparts all blessing and favor], Who has called you to His [own] eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will Himself complete and make you what you ought to be, establish and ground you securely, and strengthen, and settle you. -- 1 peter 5:10
.
To Him be the dominion (power, authority, rule) forever and ever. Amen (so be it). -- 1 peter 5:11
.
By Silvanus, a true (loyal, consistent, incorruptible) brother, as I consider him, I have written briefly to you, to counsel and urge and stimulate [you] and to declare [to you] that this is the true [account of the] grace (the undeserved favor) of God. Be steadfast and persevere in it. -- 1 peter 5:12
.
She [your sister church here] in Babylon, [who is] elect (chosen) with [yourselves], sends you greetings, and [so does] my son (disciple) Mark. -- 1 peter 5:13
.
Salute one another with a kiss of love [the symbol of mutual affection]. To all of you that are in Christ Jesus (the Messiah), may there be peace (every kind of peace and blessing, especially peace with God, and freedom from fears, agitating passions, and moral conflicts). Amen (so be it). -- 1 peter 5:14
.
SIMON PETER, a servant and apostle (special messenger) of Jesus Christ, to those who have received (obtained an equal privilege of) like precious faith with ourselves in and through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: -- 2 peter 1:1
.
May grace (God's favor) and peace (which is perfect well-being, all necessary good, all spiritual prosperity, and freedom from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts) be multiplied to you in [the full, personal, precise, and correct] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. -- 2 peter 1:2
.
For His divine power has bestowed upon us all things that [are requisite and suited] to life and godliness, through the [full, personal] knowledge of Him Who called us by and to His own glory and excellence (virtue). -- 2 peter 1:3
.
By means of these He has bestowed on us His precious and exceedingly great promises, so that through them you may escape [by flight] from the moral decay (rottenness and corruption) that is in the world because of covetousness (lust and greed), and become sharers (partakers) of the divine nature. -- 2 peter 1:4
.
For this very reason, adding your diligence [to the divine promises], employ every effort in exercising your faith to develop virtue (excellence, resolution, Christian energy), and in [exercising] virtue [develop] knowledge (intelligence), -- 2 peter 1:5
.
And in [exercising] knowledge [develop] self-control, and in [exercising] self-control [develop] steadfastness (patience, endurance), and in [exercising] steadfastness [develop] godliness (piety), -- 2 peter 1:6
.
And in [exercising] godliness [develop] brotherly affection, and in [exercising] brotherly affection [develop] Christian love. -- 2 peter 1:7
.
For as these qualities are yours and increasingly abound in you, they will keep [you] from being idle or unfruitful unto the [full personal] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- 2 peter 1:8
.
For whoever lacks these qualities is blind, [spiritually] shortsighted, seeing only what is near to him, and has become oblivious [to the fact] that he was cleansed from his old sins. -- 2 peter 1:9
.
Because of this, brethren, be all the more solicitous and eager to make sure (to ratify, to strengthen, to make steadfast) your calling and election; for if you do this, you will never stumble or fall. -- 2 peter 1:10
.
Thus there will be richly and abundantly provided for you entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. -- 2 peter 1:11
.
So I intend always to remind you about these things, although indeed you know them and are firm in the truth that [you] now [hold]. -- 2 peter 1:12
.
I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle (tent, body), to stir you up by way of remembrance, -- 2 peter 1:13
.
Since I know that the laying aside of this body of mine will come speedily, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. -- 2 peter 1:14
.
Moreover, I will diligently endeavor [to see to it] that [even] after my departure (decease) you may be able at all times to call these things to mind. -- 2 peter 1:15
.
For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah), but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty (grandeur, authority of sovereign power). -- 2 peter 1:16
.
For when He was invested with honor and glory from God the Father and a voice was borne to Him by the [splendid] Majestic Glory [in the bright cloud that overshadowed Him, saying], This is My beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased and delight, -- 2 peter 1:17
.
We [actually] heard this voice borne out of heaven, for we were together with Him on the holy mountain. -- 2 peter 1:18
.
And we have the prophetic word [made] firmer still. You will do well to pay close attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dismal (squalid and dark) place, until the day breaks through [the gloom] and the Morning Star rises (comes into being) in your hearts. -- 2 peter 1:19
.
[Yet] first [you must] understand this, that no prophecy of Scripture is [a matter] of any personal or private or special interpretation (loosening, solving). -- 2 peter 1:20
.
For no prophecy ever originated because some man willed it [to do so--it never came by human impulse], but men spoke from God who were borne along (moved and impelled) by the Holy Spirit. -- 2 peter 1:21
.
BUT ALSO [in those days] there arose false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among yourselves, who will subtly and stealthily introduce heretical doctrines (destructive heresies), even denying and disowning the Master Who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. -- 2 peter 2:1
.
And many will follow their immoral ways and lascivious doings; because of them the true Way will be maligned and defamed. -- 2 peter 2:2
.
And in their covetousness (lust, greed) they will exploit you with false (cunning) arguments. From of old the sentence [of condemnation] for them has not been idle; their destruction (eternal misery) has not been asleep. -- 2 peter 2:3
.
For God did not [even] spare angels that sinned, but cast them into hell, delivering them to be kept there in pits of gloom till the judgment and their doom. -- 2 peter 2:4
.
And He spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven other persons, when He brought a flood upon the world of ungodly [people]. -- 2 peter 2:5
.
And He condemned to ruin and extinction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, reducing them to ashes [and thus] set them forth as an example to those who would be ungodly; -- 2 peter 2:6
.
And He rescued righteous Lot, greatly worn out and distressed by the wanton ways of the ungodly and lawless-- -- 2 peter 2:7
.
For that just man, living [there] among them, tortured his righteous soul every day with what he saw and heard of [their] unlawful and wicked deeds-- -- 2 peter 2:8
.
Now if [all these things are true, then be sure] the Lord knows how to rescue the godly out of temptations and trials, and how to keep the ungodly under chastisement until the day of judgment and doom, -- 2 peter 2:9
.
And particularly those who walk after the flesh and indulge in the lust of polluting passion and scorn and despise authority. Presumptuous [and] daring [self-willed and self-loving creatures]! They scoff at and revile dignitaries (glorious ones) without trembling, -- 2 peter 2:10
.
Whereas [even] angels, though superior in might and power, do not bring a defaming charge against them before the Lord. -- 2 peter 2:11
.
But these [people]! Like unreasoning beasts, mere creatures of instinct, born [only] to be captured and destroyed, railing at things of which they are ignorant, they shall utterly perish in their [own] corruption [in their destroying they shall surely be destroyed], -- 2 peter 2:12
.
Being destined to receive [punishment as] the reward of [their] unrighteousness [suffering wrong as the hire for their wrongdoing]. They count it a delight to revel in the daytime [living luxuriously and delicately]. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions and carousing together [even] as they feast with you. -- 2 peter 2:13
.
They have eyes full of harlotry, insatiable for sin. They beguile and bait and lure away unstable souls. Their hearts are trained in covetousness (lust, greed), [they are] children of a curse [exposed to cursing]! -- 2 peter 2:14
.
Forsaking the straight road they have gone astray; they have followed the way of Balaam [the son] of Beor, who loved the reward of wickedness. -- 2 peter 2:15
.
But he was rebuked for his own transgression when a dumb beast of burden spoke with human voice and checked the prophet's madness. -- 2 peter 2:16
.
These are springs without water and mists driven along before a tempest, for whom is reserved forever the gloom of darkness. -- 2 peter 2:17
.
For uttering loud boasts of folly, they beguile and lure with lustful desires of the flesh those who are barely escaping from them who are wrongdoers. -- 2 peter 2:18
.
They promise them liberty, when they themselves are the slaves of depravity and defilement--for by whatever anyone is made inferior or worse or is overcome, to that [person or thing] he is enslaved. -- 2 peter 2:19
.
For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through [the full, personal] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they again become entangled in them and are overcome, their last condition is worse [for them] than the first. -- 2 peter 2:20
.
For never to have obtained a [full, personal] knowledge of the way of righteousness would have been better for them than, having obtained [such knowledge], to turn back from the holy commandment which was [verbally] delivered to them. -- 2 peter 2:21
.
There has befallen them the thing spoken of in the true proverb, The dog turns back to his own vomit, and, The sow is washed only to wallow again in the mire. -- 2 peter 2:22
.
BELOVED, I am now writing you this second letter. In [both of] them I have stirred up your unsullied (sincere) mind by way of remembrance, -- 2 peter 3:1
.
That you should recall the predictions of the holy (consecrated, dedicated) prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior [given] through your apostles (His special messengers). -- 2 peter 3:2
.
To begin with, you must know and understand this, that scoffers (mockers) will come in the last days with scoffing, [people who] walk after their own fleshly desires -- 2 peter 3:3
.
And say, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the forefathers fell asleep, all things have continued exactly as they did from the beginning of creation. -- 2 peter 3:4
.
For they willfully overlook and forget this [fact], that the heavens [came into] existence long ago by the word of God, and the earth also which was formed out of water and by means of water, -- 2 peter 3:5
.
Through which the world that then [existed] was deluged with water and perished. -- 2 peter 3:6
.
But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been stored up (reserved) for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly people. -- 2 peter 3:7
.
Nevertheless, do not let this one fact escape you, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. -- 2 peter 3:8
.
The Lord does not delay and is not tardy or slow about what He promises, according to some people's conception of slowness, but He is long-suffering (extraordinarily patient) toward you, not desiring that any should perish, but that all should turn to repentance. -- 2 peter 3:9
.
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will vanish (pass away) with a thunderous crash, and the [material] elements [of the universe] will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up. -- 2 peter 3:10
.
Since all these things are thus in the process of being dissolved, what kind of person ought [each of] you to be [in the meanwhile] in consecrated and holy behavior and devout and godly qualities, -- 2 peter 3:11
.
While you wait and earnestly long for (expect and hasten) the coming of the day of God by reason of which the flaming heavens will be dissolved, and the [material] elements [of the universe] will flare and melt with fire? -- 2 peter 3:12
.
But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise, in which righteousness (uprightness, freedom from sin, and right standing with God) is to abide. -- 2 peter 3:13
.
So, beloved, since you are expecting these things, be eager to be found by Him [at His coming] without spot or blemish and at peace [in serene confidence, free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts]. -- 2 peter 3:14
.
And consider that the long-suffering of our Lord [His slowness in avenging wrongs and judging the world] is salvation (that which is conducive to the soul's safety), even as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the spiritual insight given him, -- 2 peter 3:15
.
Speaking of this as he does in all of his letters. There are some things in those [epistles of Paul] that are difficult to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist and misconstrue to their own utter destruction, just as [they distort and misinterpret] the rest of the Scriptures. -- 2 peter 3:16
.
Let me warn you therefore, beloved, that knowing these things beforehand, you should be on your guard, lest you be carried away by the error of lawless and wicked [persons and] fall from your own [present] firm condition [your own steadfastness of mind]. -- 2 peter 3:17
.
But grow in grace (undeserved favor, spiritual strength) and recognition and knowledge and understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (the Messiah). To Him [be] glory (honor, majesty, and splendor) both now and to the day of eternity. Amen (so be it)! -- 2 peter 3:18
.
[WE ARE writing] about the Word of Life [in] Him Who existed from the beginning, Whom we have heard, Whom we have seen with our [own] eyes, Whom we have gazed upon [for ourselves] and have touched with our [own] hands. -- 1 john 1:1
.
And the Life [an aspect of His being] was revealed (made manifest, demonstrated), and we saw [as eyewitnesses] and are testifying to and declare to you the Life, the eternal Life [in Him] Who already existed with the Father and Who [actually] was made visible (was revealed) to us [His followers]. -- 1 john 1:2
.
What we have seen and [ourselves] heard, we are also telling you, so that you too may realize and enjoy fellowship as partners and partakers with us. And [this] fellowship that we have [which is a distinguishing mark of Christians] is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah). -- 1 john 1:3
.
And we are now writing these things to you so that our joy [in seeing you included] may be full [and your joy may be complete]. -- 1 john 1:4
.
And this is the message [the message of promise] which we have heard from Him and now are reporting to you: God is Light, and there is no darkness in Him at all [no, not in any way]. -- 1 john 1:5
.
[So] if we say we are partakers together and enjoy fellowship with Him when we live and move and are walking about in darkness, we are [both] speaking falsely and do not live and practice the Truth [which the Gospel presents]. -- 1 john 1:6
.
But if we [really] are living and walking in the Light, as He [Himself] is in the Light, we have [true, unbroken] fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses (removes) us from all sin and guilt [keeps us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations]. -- 1 john 1:7
.
If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude and lead ourselves astray, and the Truth [which the Gospel presents] is not in us [does not dwell in our hearts]. -- 1 john 1:8
.
If we [freely] admit that we have sinned and confess our sins, He is faithful and just (true to His own nature and promises) and will forgive our sins [dismiss our lawlessness] and [continuously] cleanse us from all unrighteousness [everything not in conformity to His will in purpose, thought, and action]. -- 1 john 1:9
.
If we say (claim) we have not sinned, we contradict His Word and make Him out to be false and a liar, and His Word is not in us [the divine message of the Gospel is not in our hearts]. -- 1 john 1:10
.
MY LITTLE children, I write you these things so that you may not violate God's law and sin. But if anyone should sin, we have an Advocate (One Who will intercede for us) with the Father--[it is] Jesus Christ [the all] righteous [upright, just, Who conforms to the Father's will in every purpose, thought, and action]. -- 1 john 2:1
.
And He [that same Jesus Himself] is the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins, and not for ours alone but also for [the sins of] the whole world. -- 1 john 2:2
.
And this is how we may discern [daily, by experience] that we are coming to know Him [to perceive, recognize, understand, and become better acquainted with Him]: if we keep (bear in mind, observe, practice) His teachings (precepts, commandments). -- 1 john 2:3
.
Whoever says, I know Him [I perceive, recognize, understand, and am acquainted with Him] but fails to keep and obey His commandments (teachings) is a liar, and the Truth [of the Gospel] is not in him. -- 1 john 2:4
.
But he who keeps (treasures) His Word [who bears in mind His precepts, who observes His message in its entirety], truly in him has the love of and for God been perfected (completed, reached maturity). By this we may perceive (know, recognize, and be sure) that we are in Him: -- 1 john 2:5
.
Whoever says he abides in Him ought [as a personal debt] to walk and conduct himself in the same way in which He walked and conducted Himself. -- 1 john 2:6
.
Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [the doctrine of salvation through Christ]. -- 1 john 2:7
.
Yet I am writing you a new commandment, which is true (is realized) in Him and in you, because the darkness (moral blindness) is clearing away and the true Light (the revelation of God in Christ) is already shining. -- 1 john 2:8
.
Whoever says he is in the Light and [yet] hates his brother [Christian, born-again child of God his Father] is in darkness even until now. -- 1 john 2:9
.
Whoever loves his brother [believer] abides (lives) in the Light, and in It or in him there is no occasion for stumbling or cause for error or sin. -- 1 john 2:10
.
But he who hates (detests, despises) his brother [in Christ] is in darkness and walking (living) in the dark; he is straying and does not perceive or know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. -- 1 john 2:11
.
I am writing to you, little children, because for His name's sake your sins are forgiven [pardoned through His name and on account of confessing His name]. -- 1 john 2:12
.
I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know (recognize, be aware of, and understand) Him Who [has existed] from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have been victorious over the wicked [one]. I write to you, boys (lads), because you have come to know (recognize and be aware) of the Father. -- 1 john 2:13
.
I write to you, fathers, because you have come to know (recognize, be conscious of, and understand) Him Who [has existed] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong and vigorous, and the Word of God is [always] abiding in you (in your hearts), and you have been victorious over the wicked one. -- 1 john 2:14
.
Do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. -- 1 john 2:15
.
For all that is in the world--the lust of the flesh [craving for sensual gratification] and the lust of the eyes [greedy longings of the mind] and the pride of life [assurance in one's own resources or in the stability of earthly things]--these do not come from the Father but are from the world [itself]. -- 1 john 2:16
.
And the world passes away and disappears, and with it the forbidden cravings (the passionate desires, the lust) of it; but he who does the will of God and carries out His purposes in his life abides (remains) forever. -- 1 john 2:17
.
Boys (lads), it is the last time (hour, the end of this age). And as you have heard that the antichrist [he who will oppose Christ in the guise of Christ] is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen, which confirms our belief that it is the final (the end) time. -- 1 john 2:18
.
They went out from our number, but they did not [really] belong to us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But [they withdrew] that it might be plain that they all are not of us. -- 1 john 2:19
.
But you have been anointed by [you hold a sacred appointment from, you have been given an unction from] the Holy One, and you all know [the Truth] or you know all things. -- 1 john 2:20
.
I write to you not because you are ignorant and do not perceive and know the Truth, but because you do perceive and know it, and [know positively] that nothing false (no deception, no lie) is of the Truth. -- 1 john 2:21
.
Who is [such a] liar as he who denies that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah)? He is the antichrist (the antagonist of Christ), who [habitually] denies and refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son. -- 1 john 2:22
.
No one who [habitually] denies (disowns) the Son even has the Father. Whoever confesses (acknowledges and has) the Son has the Father also. -- 1 john 2:23
.
As for you, keep in your hearts what you have heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the first dwells and remains in you, then you will dwell in the Son and in the Father [always]. -- 1 john 2:24
.
And this is what He Himself has promised us--the life, the eternal [life]. -- 1 john 2:25
.
I write this to you with reference to those who would deceive you [seduce and lead you astray]. -- 1 john 2:26
.
But as for you, the anointing (the sacred appointment, the unction) which you received from Him abides [permanently] in you; [so] then you have no need that anyone should instruct you. But just as His anointing teaches you concerning everything and is true and is no falsehood, so you must abide in (live in, never depart from) Him [being rooted in Him, knit to Him], just as [His anointing] has taught you [to do]. -- 1 john 2:27
.
And now, little children, abide (live, remain permanently) in Him, so that when He is made visible, we may have and enjoy perfect confidence (boldness, assurance) and not be ashamed and shrink from Him at His coming. -- 1 john 2:28
.
If you know (perceive and are sure) that He [Christ] is [absolutely] righteous [conforming to the Father's will in purpose, thought, and action], you may also know (be sure) that everyone who does righteously [and is therefore in like manner conformed to the divine will] is born (begotten) of Him [God]. -- 1 john 2:29
.
SEE WHAT [an incredible] quality of love the Father has given (shown, bestowed on) us, that we should [be permitted to] be named and called and counted the children of God! And so we are! The reason that the world does not know (recognize, acknowledge) us is that it does not know (recognize, acknowledge) Him. -- 1 john 3:1
.
Beloved, we are [even here and] now God's children; it is not yet disclosed (made clear) what we shall be [hereafter], but we know that when He comes and is manifested, we shall [as God's children] resemble and be like Him, for we shall see Him just as He [really] is. -- 1 john 3:2
.
And everyone who has this hope [resting] on Him cleanses (purifies) himself just as He is pure (chaste, undefiled, guiltless). -- 1 john 3:3
.
Everyone who commits (practices) sin is guilty of lawlessness; for [that is what] sin is, lawlessness (the breaking, violating of God's law by transgression or neglect--being unrestrained and unregulated by His commands and His will). -- 1 john 3:4
.
You know that He appeared in visible form and became Man to take away [upon Himself] sins, and in Him there is no sin [essentially and forever]. -- 1 john 3:5
.
No one who abides in Him [who lives and remains in communion with and in obedience to Him--deliberately, knowingly, and habitually] commits (practices) sin. No one who [habitually] sins has either seen or known Him [recognized, perceived, or understood Him, or has had an experiential acquaintance with Him]. -- 1 john 3:6
.
Boys (lads), let no one deceive and lead you astray. He who practices righteousness [who is upright, conforming to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action, living a consistently conscientious life] is righteous, even as He is righteous. -- 1 john 3:7
.
[But] he who commits sin [who practices evildoing] is of the devil [takes his character from the evil one], for the devil has sinned (violated the divine law) from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was made manifest (visible) was to undo (destroy, loosen, and dissolve) the works the devil [has done]. -- 1 john 3:8
.
No one born (begotten) of God [deliberately, knowingly, and habitually] practices sin, for God's nature abides in him [His principle of life, the divine sperm, remains permanently within him]; and he cannot practice sinning because he is born (begotten) of God. -- 1 john 3:9
.
By this it is made clear who take their nature from God and are His children and who take their nature from the devil and are his children: no one who does not practice righteousness [who does not conform to God's will in purpose, thought, and action] is of God; neither is anyone who does not love his brother (his fellow believer in Christ). -- 1 john 3:10
.
For this is the message (the announcement) which you have heard from the first, that we should love one another, -- 1 john 3:11
.
[And] not be like Cain who [took his nature and got his motivation] from the evil one and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his deeds (activities, works) were wicked and malicious and his brother's were righteous (virtuous). -- 1 john 3:12
.
Do not be surprised and wonder, brethren, that the world detests and pursues you with hatred. -- 1 john 3:13
.
We know that we have passed over out of death into Life by the fact that we love the brethren (our fellow Christians). He who does not love abides (remains, is held and kept continually) in [spiritual] death. -- 1 john 3:14
.
Anyone who hates (abominates, detests) his brother [in Christ] is [at heart] a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding (persevering) within him. -- 1 john 3:15
.
By this we come to know (progressively to recognize, to perceive, to understand) the [essential] love: that He laid down His [own] life for us; and we ought to lay [our] lives down for [those who are our] brothers [in Him]. -- 1 john 3:16
.
But if anyone has this world's goods (resources for sustaining life) and sees his brother and fellow believer in need, yet closes his heart of compassion against him, how can the love of God live and remain in him? -- 1 john 3:17
.
Little children, let us not love [merely] in theory or in speech but in deed and in truth (in practice and in sincerity). -- 1 john 3:18
.
By this we shall come to know (perceive, recognize, and understand) that we are of the Truth, and can reassure (quiet, conciliate, and pacify) our hearts in His presence, -- 1 john 3:19
.
Whenever our hearts in [tormenting] self-accusation make us feel guilty and condemn us. [For we are in God's hands.] For He is above and greater than our consciences (our hearts), and He knows (perceives and understands) everything [nothing is hidden from Him]. -- 1 john 3:20
.
And, beloved, if our consciences (our hearts) do not accuse us [if they do not make us feel guilty and condemn us], we have confidence (complete assurance and boldness) before God, -- 1 john 3:21
.
And we receive from Him whatever we ask, because we [watchfully] obey His orders [observe His suggestions and injunctions, follow His plan for us] and [habitually] practice what is pleasing to Him. -- 1 john 3:22
.
And this is His order (His command, His injunction): that we should believe in (put our faith and trust in and adhere to and rely on) the name of His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah), and that we should love one another, just as He has commanded us. -- 1 john 3:23
.
All who keep His commandments [who obey His orders and follow His plan, live and continue to live, to stay and] abide in Him, and He in them. [They let Christ be a home to them and they are the home of Christ.] And by this we know and understand and have the proof that He [really] lives and makes His home in us: by the [Holy] Spirit Whom He has given us. -- 1 john 3:24
.
BELOVED, DO not put faith in every spirit, but prove (test) the spirits to discover whether they proceed from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world. -- 1 john 4:1
.
By this you may know (perceive and recognize) the Spirit of God: every spirit which acknowledges and confesses [the fact] that Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [actually] has become man and has come in the flesh is of God [has God for its source]; -- 1 john 4:2
.
And every spirit which does not acknowledge and confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh [but would annul, destroy, sever, disunite Him] is not of God [does not proceed from Him]. This [nonconfession] is the [spirit] of the antichrist, [of] which you heard that it was coming, and now it is already in the world. -- 1 john 4:3
.
Little children, you are of God [you belong to Him] and have [already] defeated and overcome them [the agents of the antichrist], because He Who lives in you is greater (mightier) than he who is in the world. -- 1 john 4:4
.
They proceed from the world and are of the world; therefore it is out of the world [its whole economy morally considered] that they speak, and the world listens (pays attention) to them. -- 1 john 4:5
.
We are [children] of God. Whoever is learning to know God [progressively to perceive, recognize, and understand God by observation and experience, and to get an ever-clearer knowledge of Him] listens to us; and he who is not of God does not listen or pay attention to us. By this we know (recognize) the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error. -- 1 john 4:6
.
Beloved, let us love one another, for love is (springs) from God; and he who loves [his fellowmen] is begotten (born) of God and is coming [progressively] to know and understand God [to perceive and recognize and get a better and clearer knowledge of Him]. -- 1 john 4:7
.
He who does not love has not become acquainted with God [does not and never did know Him], for God is love. -- 1 john 4:8
.
In this the love of God was made manifest (displayed) where we are concerned: in that God sent His Son, the only begotten or unique [Son], into the world so that we might live through Him. -- 1 john 4:9
.
In this is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins. -- 1 john 4:10
.
Beloved, if God loved us so [very much], we also ought to love one another. -- 1 john 4:11
.
No man has at any time [yet] seen God. But if we love one another, God abides (lives and remains) in us and His love (that love which is essentially His) is brought to completion (to its full maturity, runs its full course, is perfected) in us! -- 1 john 4:12
.
By this we come to know (perceive, recognize, and understand) that we abide (live and remain) in Him and He in us: because He has given (imparted) to us of His [Holy] Spirit. -- 1 john 4:13
.
And [besides] we ourselves have seen (have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated) and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [as the] Savior of the world. -- 1 john 4:14
.
Anyone who confesses (acknowledges, owns) that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides (lives, makes His home) in him and he [abides, lives, makes his home] in God. -- 1 john 4:15
.
And we know (understand, recognize, are conscious of, by observation and by experience) and believe (adhere to and put faith in and rely on) the love God cherishes for us. God is love, and he who dwells and continues in love dwells and continues in God, and God dwells and continues in him. -- 1 john 4:16
.
In this [union and communion with Him] love is brought to completion and attains perfection with us, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment [with assurance and boldness to face Him], because as He is, so are we in this world. -- 1 john 4:17
.
There is no fear in love [dread does not exist], but full-grown (complete, perfect) love turns fear out of doors and expels every trace of terror! For fear brings with it the thought of punishment, and [so] he who is afraid has not reached the full maturity of love [is not yet grown into love's complete perfection]. -- 1 john 4:18
.
We love Him, because He first loved us. -- 1 john 4:19
.
If anyone says, I love God, and hates (detests, abominates) his brother [in Christ], he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, Whom he has not seen. -- 1 john 4:20
.
And this command (charge, order, injunction) we have from Him: that he who loves God shall love his brother [believer] also. -- 1 john 4:21
.
EVERYONE WHO believes (adheres to, trusts, and relies on the fact) that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah) is a born-again child of God; and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of Him (His offspring). -- 1 john 5:1
.
By this we come to know (recognize and understand) that we love the children of God: when we love God and obey His commands (orders, charges)--[when we keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and His teaching]. -- 1 john 5:2
.
For the [true] love of God is this: that we do His commands [keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and teaching]. And these orders of His are not irksome (burdensome, oppressive, or grievous). -- 1 john 5:3
.
For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and this is the victory that conquers the world, even our faith. -- 1 john 5:4
.
Who is it that is victorious over [that conquers] the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on that fact]? -- 1 john 5:5
.
This is He Who came by (with) water and blood [His baptism and His death], Jesus Christ (the Messiah)--not by (in) the water only, but by (in) the water and the blood. And it is the [Holy] Spirit Who bears witness, because the [Holy] Spirit is the Truth. -- 1 john 5:6
.
So there are three witnesses in heaven: the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit, and these three are One; -- 1 john 5:7
.
and there are three witnesses on the earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree [are in unison; their testimony coincides]. -- 1 john 5:8
.
If we accept [as we do] the testimony of men [if we are willing to take human authority], the testimony of God is greater (of stronger authority), for this is the testimony of God, even the witness which He has borne regarding His Son. -- 1 john 5:9
.
He who believes in the Son of God [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him] has the testimony [possesses this divine attestation] within himself. He who does not believe God [in this way] has made Him out to be and represented Him as a liar, because he has not believed (put his faith in, adhered to, and relied on) the evidence (the testimony) that God has borne regarding His Son. -- 1 john 5:10
.
And this is that testimony (that evidence): God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. -- 1 john 5:11
.
He who possesses the Son has that life; he who does not possess the Son of God does not have that life. -- 1 john 5:12
.
I write this to you who believe in (adhere to, trust in, and rely on) the name of the Son of God [in the peculiar services and blessings conferred by Him on men], so that you may know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that you [already] have life, yes, eternal life. -- 1 john 5:13
.
And this is the confidence (the assurance, the privilege of boldness) which we have in Him: [we are sure] that if we ask anything (make any request) according to His will (in agreement with His own plan), He listens to and hears us. -- 1 john 5:14
.
And if (since) we [positively] know that He listens to us in whatever we ask, we also know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that we have [granted us as our present possessions] the requests made of Him. -- 1 john 5:15
.
If anyone sees his brother [believer] committing a sin that does not [lead to] death (the extinguishing of life), he will pray and [God] will give him life [yes, He will grant life to all those whose sin is not one leading to death]. There is a sin [that leads] to death; I do not say that one should pray for that. -- 1 john 5:16
.
All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin which does not [involve] death [that may be repented of and forgiven]. -- 1 john 5:17
.
We know [absolutely] that anyone born of God does not [deliberately and knowingly] practice committing sin, but the One Who was begotten of God carefully watches over and protects him [Christ's divine presence within him preserves him against the evil], and the wicked one does not lay hold (get a grip) on him or touch [him]. -- 1 john 5:18
.
We know [positively] that we are of God, and the whole world [around us] is under the power of the evil one. -- 1 john 5:19
.
And we [have seen and] know [positively] that the Son of God has [actually] come to this world and has given us understanding and insight [progressively] to perceive (recognize) and come to know better and more clearly Him Who is true; and we are in Him Who is true--in His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah). This [Man] is the true God and Life eternal. -- 1 john 5:20
.
Little children, keep yourselves from idols (false gods)--[from anything and everything that would occupy the place in your heart due to God, from any sort of substitute for Him that would take first place in your life]. Amen (so let it be). -- 1 john 5:21
.
THE ELDERLY elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the elect (chosen) lady (Cyria) and her children, whom I truly love--and not only I but also all who are [progressively] learning to recognize and know and understand the Truth-- -- 2 john 1:1
.
Because of the Truth which lives and stays on in our hearts and will be with us forever: -- 2 john 1:2
.
Grace (spiritual blessing), mercy, and [soul] peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ (the Messiah), the Father's Son, in all sincerity (truth) and love. -- 2 john 1:3
.
I was greatly delighted to find some of your children walking (living) in [the] Truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father [Himself]. -- 2 john 1:4
.
And now I beg you, lady (Cyria), not as if I were issuing a new charge (injunction or command), but [simply recalling to your mind] the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. -- 2 john 1:5
.
And what this love consists in is this: that we live and walk in accordance with and guided by His commandments (His orders, ordinances, precepts, teaching). This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you continue to walk in love [guided by it and following it]. -- 2 john 1:6
.
For many imposters (seducers, deceivers, and false leaders) have gone out into the world, men who will not acknowledge (confess, admit) the coming of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) in bodily form. Such a one is the imposter (the seducer, the deceiver, the false leader, the antagonist of Christ) and the antichrist. -- 2 john 1:7
.
Look to yourselves (take care) that you may not lose (throw away or destroy) all that we and you have labored for, but that you may [persevere until you] win and receive back a perfect reward [in full]. -- 2 john 1:8
.
Anyone who runs on ahead [of God] and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ [who is not content with what He taught] does not have God; but he who continues to live in the doctrine (teaching) of Christ [does have God], he has both the Father and the Son. -- 2 john 1:9
.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine [is disloyal to what Jesus Christ taught], do not receive him [do not accept him, do not welcome or admit him] into [your] house or bid him Godspeed or give him any encouragement. -- 2 john 1:10
.
For he who wishes him success [who encourages him, wishing him Godspeed] is a partaker in his evil doings. -- 2 john 1:11
.
I have many things to write to you, but I prefer not to do so with paper and ink; I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. -- 2 john 1:12
.
The children of your elect (chosen) sister wish to be remembered to you. Amen (so be it). -- 2 john 1:13
.
THE ELDERLY elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the beloved (esteemed) Gaius, whom I truly love. -- 3 john 1:1
.
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in every way and [that your body] may keep well, even as [I know] your soul keeps well and prospers. -- 3 john 1:2
.
In fact, I greatly rejoiced when [some of] the brethren from time to time arrived and spoke [so highly] of the sincerity and fidelity of your life, as indeed you do live in the Truth [the whole Gospel presents]. -- 3 john 1:3
.
I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my [spiritual] children are living their lives in the Truth. -- 3 john 1:4
.
Beloved, it is a fine and faithful work that you are doing when you give any service to the [Christian] brethren, and [especially when they are] strangers. -- 3 john 1:5
.
They have testified before the church of your love and friendship. You will do well to forward them on their journey [and you will please do so] in a way worthy of God's [service]. -- 3 john 1:6
.
For these [traveling missionaries] have gone out for the Name's sake (for His sake) and are accepting nothing from the Gentiles (the heathen, the non-Israelites). -- 3 john 1:7
.
So we ourselves ought to support such people [to welcome and provide for them], in order that we may be fellow workers in the Truth (the whole Gospel) and cooperate with its teachers. -- 3 john 1:8
.
I have written briefly to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to take the lead among them and put himself first, does not acknowledge my authority and refuses to accept my suggestions or to listen to me. -- 3 john 1:9
.
So when I arrive, I will call attention to what he is doing, his boiling over and casting malicious reflections upon us with insinuating language. And not satisfied with that, he refuses to receive and welcome the [missionary] brethren himself, and also interferes with and forbids those who would welcome them, and tries to expel (excommunicate) them from the church. -- 3 john 1:10
.
Beloved, do not imitate evil, but imitate good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen (discerned or experienced) God [has enjoyed no vision of Him and does not know Him at all]. -- 3 john 1:11
.
Demetrius has warm commendation from everyone--and from the Truth itself; we add our testimony also, and you know that our testimony is true. -- 3 john 1:12
.
I had much [to say to you when I began] to write, but I prefer not to put it down with pen (a reed) and ink; -- 3 john 1:13
.
I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face. -- 3 john 1:14
.
JUDE, A servant of Jesus Christ (the Messiah), and brother of James, [writes this letter] to those who are called (chosen), dearly loved by God the Father and separated (set apart) and kept for Jesus Christ: -- jude 1:1
.
May mercy, [soul] peace, and love be multiplied to you. -- jude 1:2
.
Beloved, my whole concern was to write to you in regard to our common salvation. [But] I found it necessary and was impelled to write you and urgently appeal to and exhort [you] to contend for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints [the faith which is that sum of Christian belief which was delivered verbally to the holy people of God]. -- jude 1:3
.
For certain men have crept in stealthily [gaining entrance secretly by a side door]. Their doom was predicted long ago, ungodly (impious, profane) persons who pervert the grace (the spiritual blessing and favor) of our God into lawlessness and wantonness and immorality, and disown and deny our sole Master and Lord, Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- jude 1:4
.
Now I want to remind you, though you were fully informed once for all, that though the Lord [at one time] delivered a people out of the land of Egypt, He subsequently destroyed those [of them] who did not believe [who refused to adhere to, trust in, and rely upon Him]. -- jude 1:5
.
And angels who did not keep (care for, guard, and hold to) their own first place of power but abandoned their proper dwelling place--these He has reserved in custody in eternal chains (bonds) under the thick gloom of utter darkness until the judgment and doom of the great day. -- jude 1:6
.
[The wicked are sentenced to suffer] just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the adjacent towns--which likewise gave themselves over to impurity and indulged in unnatural vice and sensual perversity--are laid out [in plain sight] as an exhibit of perpetual punishment [to warn] of everlasting fire. -- jude 1:7
.
Nevertheless in like manner, these dreamers also corrupt the body, scorn and reject authority and government, and revile and libel and scoff at [heavenly] glories (the glorious ones). -- jude 1:8
.
But when [even] the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, judicially argued (disputed) about the body of Moses, he dared not [presume to] bring an abusive condemnation against him, but [simply] said, The Lord rebuke you! -- jude 1:9
.
But these men revile (scoff and sneer at) anything they do not happen to be acquainted with and do not understand; and whatever they do understand physically [that which they know by mere instinct], like irrational beasts--by these they corrupt themselves and are destroyed (perish). -- jude 1:10
.
Woe to them! For they have run riotously in the way of Cain, and have abandoned themselves for the sake of gain [it offers them, following] the error of Balaam, and have perished in rebellion [like that] of Korah! -- jude 1:11
.
These are hidden reefs (elements of danger) in your love feasts, where they boldly feast sumptuously [carousing together in your midst], without scruples providing for themselves [alone]. They are clouds without water, swept along by the winds; trees, without fruit at the late autumn gathering time--twice (doubly) dead, [lifeless and] plucked up by the roots; -- jude 1:12
.
Wild waves of the sea, flinging up the foam of their own shame and disgrace; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of eternal darkness has been reserved forever. -- jude 1:13
.
It was of these people, moreover, that Enoch in the seventh [generation] from Adam prophesied when he said, Behold, the Lord comes with His myriads of holy ones (ten thousands of His saints) -- jude 1:14
.
To execute judgment upon all and to convict all the impious (unholy ones) of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed [in such an] ungodly [way], and of all the severe (abusive, jarring) things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him. -- jude 1:15
.
These are inveterate murmurers (grumblers) who complain [of their lot in life], going after their own desires [controlled by their passions]; their talk is boastful and arrogant, [and they claim to] admire men's persons and pay people flattering compliments to gain advantage. -- jude 1:16
.
But you must remember, beloved, the predictions which were made by the apostles (the special messengers) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). -- jude 1:17
.
They told you beforehand, In the last days (in the end time) there will be scoffers [who seek to gratify their own unholy desires], following after their own ungodly passions. -- jude 1:18
.
It is these who are [agitators] setting up distinctions and causing divisions--merely sensual [creatures, carnal, worldly-minded people], devoid of the [Holy] Spirit and destitute of any higher spiritual life. -- jude 1:19
.
But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit; -- jude 1:20
.
Guard and keep yourselves in the love of God; expect and patiently wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah)--[which will bring you] unto life eternal. -- jude 1:21
.
And refute [so as to] convict some who dispute with you, and on some have mercy who waver and doubt. -- jude 1:22
.
[Strive to] save others, snatching [them] out of [the] fire; on others take pity [but] with fear, loathing even the garment spotted by the flesh and polluted by their sensuality. -- jude 1:23
.
Now to Him Who is able to keep you without stumbling or slipping or falling, and to present [you] unblemished (blameless and faultless) before the presence of His glory in triumphant joy and exultation [with unspeakable, ecstatic delight]-- -- jude 1:24
.
To the one only God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory (splendor), majesty, might and dominion, and power and authority, before all time and now and forever (unto all the ages of eternity). Amen (so be it). -- jude 1:25
.
[THIS IS] the revelation of Jesus Christ [His unveiling of the divine mysteries]. God gave it to Him to disclose and make known to His bond servants certain things which must shortly and speedily come to pass in their entirety. And He sent and communicated it through His angel (messenger) to His bond servant John, -- revelation 1:1
.
Who has testified to and vouched for all that he saw [in his visions], the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. -- revelation 1:2
.
Blessed (happy, to be envied) is the man who reads aloud [in the assemblies] the word of this prophecy; and blessed (happy, to be envied) are those who hear [it read] and who keep themselves true to the things which are written in it [heeding them and laying them to heart], for the time [for them to be fulfilled] is near. -- revelation 1:3
.
John to the seven assemblies (churches) that are in Asia: May grace (God's unmerited favor) be granted to you and spiritual peace (the peace of Christ's kingdom) from Him Who is and Who was and Who is to come, and from the seven Spirits [the sevenfold Holy Spirit] before His throne, -- revelation 1:4
.
And from Jesus Christ the faithful and trustworthy Witness, the Firstborn of the dead [first to be brought back to life] and the Prince (Ruler) of the kings of the earth. To Him Who ever loves us and has once [for all] loosed and freed us from our sins by His own blood, -- revelation 1:5
.
And formed us into a kingdom (a royal race), priests to His God and Father--to Him be the glory and the power and the majesty and the dominion throughout the ages and forever and ever. Amen (so be it). -- revelation 1:6
.
Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth shall gaze upon Him and beat their breasts and mourn and lament over Him. Even so [must it be]. Amen (so be it). -- revelation 1:7
.
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, says the Lord God, He Who is and Who was and Who is to come, the Almighty (the Ruler of all). -- revelation 1:8
.
I, John, your brother and companion (sharer and participator) with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance [which are] in Jesus Christ, was on the isle called Patmos, [banished] on account of [my witnessing to] the Word of God and the testimony (the proof, the evidence) for Jesus Christ. -- revelation 1:9
.
I was in the Spirit [rapt in His power] on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a great voice like the calling of a war trumpet, -- revelation 1:10
.
Saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last. Write promptly what you see (your vision) in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia--to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. -- revelation 1:11
.
Then I turned to see [whose was] the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, -- revelation 1:12
.
And in the midst of the lampstands [One] like a Son of Man, clothed with a robe which reached to His feet and with a girdle of gold about His breast. -- revelation 1:13
.
His head and His hair were white like white wool, [as white] as snow, and His eyes [flashed] like a flame of fire. -- revelation 1:14
.
His feet glowed like burnished (bright) bronze as it is refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. -- revelation 1:15
.
In His right hand He held seven stars, and from His mouth there came forth a sharp two-edged sword, and His face was like the sun shining in full power at midday. -- revelation 1:16
.
When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as if dead. But He laid His right hand on me and said, Do not be afraid! I am the First and the Last, -- revelation 1:17
.
And the Ever-living One [I am living in the eternity of the eternities]. I died, but see, I am alive forevermore; and I possess the keys of death and Hades (the realm of the dead). -- revelation 1:18
.
Write therefore the things you see, what they are [and signify] and what is to take place hereafter. -- revelation 1:19
.
As to the hidden meaning (the mystery) of the seven stars which you saw on My right hand and the seven lampstands of gold: the seven stars are the seven angels (messengers) of the seven assemblies (churches) and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. -- revelation 1:20
.
TO THE angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Ephesus write: These are the words of Him Who holds the seven stars [which are the messengers of the seven churches] in His right hand, Who goes about among the seven golden lampstands [which are the seven churches]: -- revelation 2:1
.
I know your industry and activities, laborious toil and trouble, and your patient endurance, and how you cannot tolerate wicked [men] and have tested and critically appraised those who call [themselves] apostles (special messengers of Christ) and yet are not, and have found them to be impostors and liars. -- revelation 2:2
.
I know you are enduring patiently and are bearing up for My name's sake, and you have not fainted or become exhausted or grown weary. -- revelation 2:3
.
But I have this [one charge to make] against you: that you have left (abandoned) the love that you had at first [you have deserted Me, your first love]. -- revelation 2:4
.
Remember then from what heights you have fallen. Repent (change the inner man to meet God's will) and do the works you did previously [when first you knew the Lord], or else I will visit you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you change your mind and repent. -- revelation 2:5
.
Yet you have this [in your favor and to your credit]: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans [what they are doing as corrupters of the people], which I Myself also detest. -- revelation 2:6
.
He who is able to hear, let him listen to and give heed to what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). To him who overcomes (is victorious), I will grant to eat [of the fruit] of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God. -- revelation 2:7
.
And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Smyrna write: These are the words of the First and the Last, Who died and came to life again: -- revelation 2:8
.
I know your affliction and distress and pressing trouble and your poverty--but you are rich! and how you are abused and reviled and slandered by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. -- revelation 2:9
.
Fear nothing that you are about to suffer. [Dismiss your dread and your fears!] Behold, the devil is indeed about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested and proved and critically appraised, and for ten days you will have affliction. Be loyally faithful unto death [even if you must die for it], and I will give you the crown of life. -- revelation 2:10
.
He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). He who overcomes (is victorious) shall in no way be injured by the second death. -- revelation 2:11
.
Then to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Pergamum write: These are the words of Him Who has and wields the sharp two-edged sword: -- revelation 2:12
.
I know where you live--a place where Satan sits enthroned. [Yet] you are clinging to and holding fast My name, and you did not deny My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed (martyred) in your midst--where Satan dwells. -- revelation 2:13
.
Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people there who are clinging to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to set a trap and a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, [to entice them] to eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and to practice lewdness [giving themselves up to sexual vice]. -- revelation 2:14
.
You also have some who in a similar way are clinging to the teaching of the Nicolaitans [those corrupters of the people] which thing I hate. -- revelation 2:15
.
Repent [then]! Or else I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth. -- revelation 2:16
.
He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). To him who overcomes (conquers), I will give to eat of the manna that is hidden, and I will give him a white stone with a new name engraved on the stone, which no one knows or understands except he who receives it. -- revelation 2:17
.
And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, Who has eyes that flash like a flame of fire, and Whose feet glow like bright and burnished and white-hot bronze: -- revelation 2:18
.
I know your record and what you are doing, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your recent works are more numerous and greater than your first ones. -- revelation 2:19
.
But I have this against you: that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess [claiming to be inspired], and who is teaching and leading astray my servants and beguiling them into practicing sexual vice and eating food sacrificed to idols. [I Kings 16:31; II Kings 9:22, 30.] -- revelation 2:20
.
I gave her time to repent, but she has no desire to repent of her immorality [symbolic of idolatry] and refuses to do so. -- revelation 2:21
.
Take note: I will throw her on a bed [of anguish], and those who commit adultery with her [her paramours] I will bring down to pressing distress and severe affliction, unless they turn away their minds from conduct [such as] hers and repent of their doings. -- revelation 2:22
.
And I will strike her children (her proper followers) dead [thoroughly exterminating them]. And all the assemblies (churches) shall recognize and understand that I am He Who searches minds (the thoughts, feelings, and purposes) and the [inmost] hearts, and I will give to each of you [the reward for what you have done] as your work deserves. -- revelation 2:23
.
But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not explored and known the depths of Satan, as they say--I tell you that I do not lay upon you any other [fresh] burden: -- revelation 2:24
.
Only hold fast to what you have until I come. -- revelation 2:25
.
And he who overcomes (is victorious) and who obeys My commands to the [very] end [doing the works that please Me], I will give him authority and power over the nations; -- revelation 2:26
.
And he shall rule them with a sceptre (rod) of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, and [his power over them shall be] like that which I Myself have received from My Father; -- revelation 2:27
.
And I will give him the Morning Star. -- revelation 2:28
.
He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). -- revelation 2:29
.
AND TO the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Sardis write: These are the words of Him Who has the seven Spirits of God [the sevenfold Holy Spirit] and the seven stars: I know your record and what you are doing; you are supposed to be alive, but [in reality] you are dead. -- revelation 3:1
.
Rouse yourselves and keep awake, and strengthen and invigorate what remains and is on the point of dying; for I have not found a thing that you have done [any work of yours] meeting the requirements of My God or perfect in His sight. -- revelation 3:2
.
So call to mind the lessons you received and heard; continually lay them to heart and obey them, and repent. In case you will not rouse yourselves and keep awake and watch, I will come upon you like a thief, and you will not know or suspect at what hour I will come. -- revelation 3:3
.
Yet you still have a few [persons'] names in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes, and they shall walk with Me in white, because they are worthy and deserving. -- revelation 3:4
.
Thus shall he who conquers (is victorious) be clad in white garments, and I will not erase or blot out his name from the Book of Life; I will acknowledge him [as Mine] and I will confess his name openly before My Father and before His angels. -- revelation 3:5
.
He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). -- revelation 3:6
.
And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Philadelphia write: These are the words of the Holy One, the True One, He Who has the key of David, Who opens and no one shall shut, Who shuts and no one shall open: -- revelation 3:7
.
I know your [record of] works and what you are doing. See! I have set before you a door wide open which no one is able to shut; I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept My Word and guarded My message and have not renounced or denied My name. -- revelation 3:8
.
Take note! I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews and are not, but lie--behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and learn and acknowledge that I have loved you. -- revelation 3:9
.
Because you have guarded and kept My word of patient endurance [have held fast the lesson of My patience with the expectant endurance that I give you], I also will keep you [safe] from the hour of trial (testing) which is coming on the whole world to try those who dwell upon the earth. -- revelation 3:10
.
I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one may rob you and deprive you of your crown. -- revelation 3:11
.
He who overcomes (is victorious), I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God; he shall never be put out of it or go out of it, and I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which descends from My God out of heaven, and My own new name. -- revelation 3:12
.
He who can hear, let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). -- revelation 3:13
.
And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the trusty and faithful and true Witness, the Origin and Beginning and Author of God's creation: -- revelation 3:14
.
I know your [record of] works and what you are doing; you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot! -- revelation 3:15
.
So, because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of My mouth! -- revelation 3:16
.
For you say, I am rich; I have prospered and grown wealthy, and I am in need of nothing; and you do not realize and understand that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. -- revelation 3:17
.
Therefore I counsel you to purchase from Me gold refined and tested by fire, that you may be [truly] wealthy, and white clothes to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nudity from being seen, and salve to put on your eyes, that you may see. -- revelation 3:18
.
Those whom I [dearly and tenderly] love, I tell their faults and convict and convince and reprove and chasten [I discipline and instruct them]. So be enthusiastic and in earnest and burning with zeal and repent [changing your mind and attitude]. -- revelation 3:19
.
Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears and listens to and heeds My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will eat with him, and he [will eat] with Me. -- revelation 3:20
.
He who overcomes (is victorious), I will grant him to sit beside Me on My throne, as I Myself overcame (was victorious) and sat down beside My Father on His throne. -- revelation 3:21
.
He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). -- revelation 3:22
.
AFTER THIS I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice which I had heard addressing me like [the calling of] a war trumpet said, Come up here, and I will show you what must take place in the future. -- revelation 4:1
.
At once I came under the [Holy] Spirit's power, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with One seated on the throne! -- revelation 4:2
.
And He Who sat there appeared like [the crystalline brightness of] jasper and [the fiery] sardius, and encircling the throne there was a halo that looked like [a rainbow of] emerald. -- revelation 4:3
.
Twenty-four other thrones surrounded the throne, and seated on these thrones were twenty-four elders (the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin), arrayed in white clothing, with crowns of gold upon their heads. -- revelation 4:4
.
Out from the throne came flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder, and in front of the throne seven blazing torches burned, which are the seven Spirits of God [the sevenfold Holy Spirit]; -- revelation 4:5
.
And in front of the throne there was also what looked like a transparent glassy sea, as if of crystal. And around the throne, in the center at each side of the throne, were four living creatures (beings) who were full of eyes in front and behind [with intelligence as to what is before and at the rear of them]. -- revelation 4:6
.
The first living creature (being) was like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature [was] like a flying eagle. -- revelation 4:7
.
And the four living creatures, individually having six wings, were full of eyes all over and within [underneath their wings]; and day and night they never stop saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty (Omnipotent), Who was and Who is and Who is to come. -- revelation 4:8
.
And whenever the living creatures offer glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him Who sits on the throne, Who lives forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities), -- revelation 4:9
.
The twenty-four elders (the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin) fall prostrate before Him Who is sitting on the throne, and they worship Him Who lives forever and ever; and they throw down their crowns before the throne, crying out, -- revelation 4:10
.
Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and dominion, for You created all things; by Your will they were [brought into being] and were created. -- revelation 4:11
.
AND I saw lying on the open hand of Him Who was seated on the throne a scroll (book) written within and on the back, closed and sealed with seven seals; -- revelation 5:1
.
And I saw a strong angel announcing in a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll? And [who is entitled and deserves and is morally fit] to break its seals? -- revelation 5:2
.
And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth [in the realm of the dead, Hades] was able to open the scroll or to take a [single] look at its contents. -- revelation 5:3
.
And I wept audibly and bitterly because no one was found fit to open the scroll or to inspect it. -- revelation 5:4
.
Then one of the elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] said to me, Stop weeping! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root (Source) of David, has won (has overcome and conquered)! He can open the scroll and break its seven seals! -- revelation 5:5
.
And there between the throne and the four living creatures (beings) and among the elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God [the sevenfold Holy Spirit] Who have been sent [on duty far and wide] into all the earth. -- revelation 5:6
.
He then went and took the scroll from the right hand of Him Who sat on the throne. -- revelation 5:7
.
And when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] prostrated themselves before the Lamb. Each was holding a harp (lute or guitar), and they had golden bowls full of incense (fragrant spices and gums for burning), which are the prayers of God's people (the saints). -- revelation 5:8
.
And [now] they sing a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the scroll and to break the seals that are on it, for You were slain (sacrificed), and with Your blood You purchased men unto God from every tribe and language and people and nation. -- revelation 5:9
.
And You have made them a kingdom (royal race) and priests to our God, and they shall reign [as kings] over the earth! -- revelation 5:10
.
Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels on every side of the throne and of the living creatures and the elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin], and they numbered ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands, -- revelation 5:11
.
Saying in a loud voice, Deserving is the Lamb, Who was sacrificed, to receive all the power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and majesty (glory, splendor) and blessing! -- revelation 5:12
.
And I heard every created thing in heaven and on earth and under the earth [in Hades, the place of departed spirits] and on the sea and all that is in it, crying out together, To Him Who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed the blessing and the honor and the majesty (glory, splendor) and the power (might and dominion) forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities)! -- revelation 5:13
.
Then the four living creatures (beings) said, Amen (so be it)! And the elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] prostrated themselves and worshiped Him Who lives forever and ever. -- revelation 5:14
.
THEN I saw as the Lamb broke open one of the seven seals, and as if in a voice of thunder I heard one of the four living creatures call out, Come! -- revelation 6:1
.
And I looked, and saw there a white horse whose rider carried a bow. And a crown was given him, and he rode forth conquering and to conquer. -- revelation 6:2
.
And when He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out, Come! -- revelation 6:3
.
And another horse came out, flaming red. And its rider was empowered to take the peace from the earth, so that men slaughtered one another; and he was given a huge sword. -- revelation 6:4
.
When He broke open the third seal, I heard the third living creature call out, Come and look ! And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and in his hand the rider had a pair of scales (a balance). -- revelation 6:5
.
And I heard what seemed to be a voice from the midst of the four living creatures, saying, A quart of wheat for a denarius [a whole day's wages], and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine! [II Kings 6:25.] -- revelation 6:6
.
When the Lamb broke open the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature call out, Come! -- revelation 6:7
.
So I looked, and behold, an ashy pale horse [black and blue as if made so by bruising], and its rider's name was Death, and Hades (the realm of the dead) followed him closely. And they were given authority and power over a fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with plague (pestilence, disease) and with wild beasts of the earth. -- revelation 6:8
.
When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal, I saw at the foot of the altar the souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed for [adhering to] the Word of God and for the testimony they had borne. -- revelation 6:9
.
They cried in a loud voice, O [Sovereign] Lord, holy and true, how long now before You will sit in judgment and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth? -- revelation 6:10
.
Then they were each given a long and flowing and festive white robe and told to rest and wait patiently a little while longer, until the number should be complete of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed as they themselves had been. -- revelation 6:11
.
When He [the Lamb] broke open the sixth seal, I looked, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun grew black as sackcloth of hair, [the full disc of] the moon became like blood. -- revelation 6:12
.
And the stars of the sky dropped to the earth like a fig tree shedding its unripe fruit out of season when shaken by a strong wind. -- revelation 6:13
.
And the sky rolled up like a scroll and vanished, and every mountain and island was dislodged from its place. -- revelation 6:14
.
Then the kings of the earth and their noblemen and their magnates and their military chiefs and the wealthy and the strong and [everyone, whether] slave or free hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, -- revelation 6:15
.
And they called to the mountains and the rocks, Fall on (before) us and hide us from the face of Him Who sits on the throne and from the deep-seated indignation and wrath of the Lamb. -- revelation 6:16
.
For the great day of His wrath (vengeance, retribution, indignation) has come, and who is able to stand before it? -- revelation 6:17
.
AFTER THIS I saw four angels stationed at the four corners of the earth, firmly holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind should blow on the earth or sea or upon any tree. -- revelation 7:1
.
Then I saw a second angel coming up from the east (the rising of the sun) and carrying the seal of the living God. And with a loud voice he called out to the four angels who had been given authority and power to injure earth and sea, -- revelation 7:2
.
Saying, Harm neither the earth nor the sea nor the trees, until we have sealed the bond servants of our God upon their foreheads. -- revelation 7:3
.
And [then] I heard how many were sealed (marked) out of every tribe of the sons of Israel: there were 144,000. -- revelation 7:4
.
Twelve thousand were sealed (marked) out of the tribe of Judah, 12,of the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 of the tribe of Gad, -- revelation 7:5
.
Twelve thousand of the tribe of Asher, 12,of the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 of the tribe of Manasseh, -- revelation 7:6
.
Twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon, 12,of the tribe of Levi, 12,000 of the tribe of Issachar, -- revelation 7:7
.
Twelve thousand of the tribe of Zebulun, 12,of the tribe of Joseph, 12,000 of the tribe of Benjamin. -- revelation 7:8
.
After this I looked and a vast host appeared which no one could count, [gathered out] of every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages. These stood before the throne and before the Lamb; they were attired in white robes, with palm branches in their hands. -- revelation 7:9
.
In loud voice they cried, saying, [Our] salvation is due to our God, Who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb [to Them we owe our deliverance]! -- revelation 7:10
.
And all the angels were standing round the throne and round the elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] and the four living creatures, and they fell prostrate before the throne and worshiped God. -- revelation 7:11
.
Amen! (So be it!) they cried. Blessing and glory and majesty and splendor and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and might [be ascribed] to our God to the ages and ages (forever and ever, throughout the eternities of the eternities)! Amen! (So be it!) -- revelation 7:12
.
Then, addressing me, one of the elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] said, Who are these [people] clothed in the long white robes? And from where have they come? -- revelation 7:13
.
I replied, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they who have come out of the great tribulation (persecution), and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. -- revelation 7:14
.
For this reason they are [now] before the [very] throne of God and serve Him day and night in His sanctuary (temple); and He Who is sitting upon the throne will protect and spread His tabernacle over and shelter them with His presence. -- revelation 7:15
.
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat. -- revelation 7:16
.
For the Lamb Who is in the midst of the throne will be their Shepherd, and He will guide them to the springs of the waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. -- revelation 7:17
.
WHEN HE [the Lamb] broke open the seventh seal, there was silence for about half an hour in heaven. -- revelation 8:1
.
Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets. -- revelation 8:2
.
And another angel came and stood over the altar. He had a golden censer, and he was given very much incense (fragrant spices and gums which exhale perfume when burned), that he might mingle it with the prayers of all the people of God (the saints) upon the golden altar before the throne. -- revelation 8:3
.
And the smoke of the incense (the perfume) arose in the presence of God, with the prayers of the people of God (the saints), from the hand of the angel. -- revelation 8:4
.
So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and cast it upon the earth. Then there followed peals of thunder and loud rumblings and blasts and noises, and flashes of lightning and an earthquake. -- revelation 8:5
.
Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them. -- revelation 8:6
.
The first angel blew [his] trumpet, and there was a storm of hail and fire mingled with blood cast upon the earth. And a third part of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees was burned up and all the green grass was burned up. -- revelation 8:7
.
The second angel blew [his] trumpet, and something resembling a great mountain, blazing with fire, was hurled into the sea. -- revelation 8:8
.
And a third of the sea was turned to blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea perished, and a third of the ships were destroyed. -- revelation 8:9
.
The third angel blew [his] trumpet, and a huge star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it dropped on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water-- -- revelation 8:10
.
And the name of the star is Wormwood. A third part of the waters was changed into wormwood, and many people died from using the water, because it had become bitter. -- revelation 8:11
.
Then the fourth angel blew [his] trumpet, and a third of the sun was smitten, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that [the light of] a third of them was darkened, and a third of the daylight [itself] was withdrawn, and likewise a third [of the light] of the night was kept from shining. -- revelation 8:12
.
Then I [looked and I] saw a solitary eagle flying in midheaven, and as it flew I heard it crying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the rest of the trumpet blasts which the three angels are about to sound! -- revelation 8:13
.
THEN THE fifth angel blew [his] trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth; and to the angel was given the key of the shaft of the Abyss (the bottomless pit). -- revelation 9:1
.
He opened the long shaft of the Abyss (the bottomless pit), and smoke like the smoke of a huge furnace puffed out of the long shaft, so that the sun and the atmosphere were darkened by the smoke from the long shaft. -- revelation 9:2
.
Then out of the smoke locusts came forth on the earth, and such power was granted them as the power the earth's scorpions have. -- revelation 9:3
.
They were told not to injure the herbage of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree, but only [to attack] such human beings as do not have the seal (mark) of God on their foreheads. -- revelation 9:4
.
They were not permitted to kill them, but to torment (distress, vex) them for five months; and the pain caused them was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings a person. -- revelation 9:5
.
And in those days people will seek death and will not find it; and they will yearn to die, but death evades and flees from them. -- revelation 9:6
.
The locusts resembled horses equipped for battle. On their heads was something like golden crowns. Their faces resembled the faces of people. -- revelation 9:7
.
They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like lions' teeth. -- revelation 9:8
.
Their breastplates (scales) resembled breastplates made of iron, and the [whirring] noise made by their wings was like the roar of a vast number of horse-drawn chariots going at full speed into battle. -- revelation 9:9
.
They have tails like scorpions, and they have stings, and in their tails lies their ability to hurt men for [the] five months. -- revelation 9:10
.
Over them as king they have the angel of the Abyss (of the bottomless pit). In Hebrew his name is Abaddon [destruction], but in Greek he is called Apollyon [destroyer]. -- revelation 9:11
.
The first woe (calamity) has passed; behold, two others are yet to follow. -- revelation 9:12
.
Then the sixth angel blew [his] trumpet, and from the four horns of the golden altar which stands before God I heard a solitary voice, -- revelation 9:13
.
Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Liberate the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates. -- revelation 9:14
.
So the four angels who had been in readiness for that hour in the appointed day, month, and year were liberated to destroy a third of mankind. -- revelation 9:15
.
The number of their troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand (200,000,000); I heard what their number was. -- revelation 9:16
.
And in [my] vision the horses and their riders appeared to me like this: the riders wore breastplates the color of fiery red and sapphire blue and sulphur (brimstone) yellow. The heads of the horses looked like lions' heads, and from their mouths there poured fire and smoke and sulphur (brimstone). -- revelation 9:17
.
A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues--by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur (brimstone) that poured from the mouths of the horses. -- revelation 9:18
.
For the power of the horses to do harm is in their mouths and also in their tails. Their tails are like serpents, for they have heads, and it is by means of them that they wound people. -- revelation 9:19
.
And the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues even then did not repent of [the worship of] the works of their [own] hands, so as to cease paying homage to the demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor move. -- revelation 9:20
.
And they did not repent of their murders or their practice of magic (sorceries) or their sexual vice or their thefts. -- revelation 9:21
.
THEN I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, robed in a cloud, with a [halo like a] rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun, and his feet (legs) were like columns of fire. -- revelation 10:1
.
He had a little book (scroll) open in his hand. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, -- revelation 10:2
.
And he shouted with a loud voice like the roaring of a lion; and when he had shouted, the seven thunders gave voice and uttered their message in distinct words. -- revelation 10:3
.
And when the seven thunders had spoken (sounded), I was going to write [it down], but I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up what the seven thunders have said! Do not write it down! -- revelation 10:4
.
Then the [mighty] angel whom I had seen stationed on sea and land raised his right hand to heaven (the sky), -- revelation 10:5
.
And swore in the name of (by) Him Who lives forever and ever, Who created the heavens (sky) and all they contain, and the earth and all that it contains, and the sea and all that it contains. [He swore] that no more time should intervene and there should be no more waiting or delay, -- revelation 10:6
.
But that when the days come when the trumpet call of the seventh angel is about to be sounded, then God's mystery (His secret design, His hidden purpose), as He had announced the glad tidings to His servants the prophets, should be fulfilled (accomplished, completed). -- revelation 10:7
.
Then the voice that I heard from heaven spoke again to me, saying, Go and take the little book (scroll) which is open on the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. -- revelation 10:8
.
So I went up to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said to me, Take it and eat it. It will embitter your stomach, though in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey. -- revelation 10:9
.
So I took the little book from the angel's hand and ate and swallowed it; it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but once I had swallowed it, my stomach was embittered. -- revelation 10:10
.
Then they said to me, You are to make a fresh prophecy concerning many peoples and races and nations and languages and kings. -- revelation 10:11
.
A REED [as a measuring rod] was then given to me, [shaped] like a staff, and I was told: Rise up and measure the sanctuary of God and the altar [of incense], and [number] those who worship there. -- revelation 11:1
.
But leave out of your measuring the court outside the sanctuary of God; omit that, for it is given over to the Gentiles (the nations), and they will trample the holy city underfoot for months (three and one-half years). -- revelation 11:2
.
And I will grant the power of prophecy to My two witnesses for 1,(42 months; three and one-half years), dressed in sackcloth. -- revelation 11:3
.
These [witnesses] are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth. -- revelation 11:4
.
And if anyone attempts to injure them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their enemies; if anyone should attempt to harm them, thus he is doomed to be slain. [II Kings 1:10; Jer. 5:14.] -- revelation 11:5
.
These [two witnesses] have power to shut up the sky, so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying (their prediction of events relating to Christ's kingdom and its speedy triumph); and they also have power to turn the waters into blood and to smite and scourge the earth with all manner of plagues as often as they choose. -- revelation 11:6
.
But when they have finished their testimony and their evidence is all in, the beast (monster) that comes up out of the Abyss (bottomless pit) will wage war on them, and conquer them and kill them. -- revelation 11:7
.
And their dead bodies [will lie exposed] in the open street (a public square) of the great city which is in a spiritual sense called [by the mystical and allegorical names of] Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. -- revelation 11:8
.
For three and a half days men from the races and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be put in a tomb. -- revelation 11:9
.
And those who dwell on the earth will gloat and exult over them and rejoice exceedingly, taking their ease and sending presents [in congratulation] to one another, because these two prophets had been such a vexation and trouble and torment to all the dwellers on the earth. -- revelation 11:10
.
But after three and a half days, by God's gift the breath of life again entered into them, and they rose up on their feet, and great dread and terror fell on those who watched them. -- revelation 11:11
.
Then [the two witnesses] heard a strong voice from heaven calling to them, Come up here! And before the very eyes of their enemies they ascended into heaven in a cloud. [II Kings 2:11.] -- revelation 11:12
.
And at that [very] hour there was a tremendous earthquake and one tenth of the city was destroyed (fell); seven thousand people perished in the earthquake, and those who remained were filled with dread and terror and were awe-struck, and they glorified the God of heaven. -- revelation 11:13
.
The second woe (calamity) has passed; now the third woe is speedily to come. -- revelation 11:14
.
The seventh angel then blew [his] trumpet, and there were mighty voices in heaven, shouting, The dominion (kingdom, sovereignty, rule) of the world has now come into the possession and become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (the Messiah), and He shall reign forever and ever (for the eternities of the eternities)! -- revelation 11:15
.
Then the twenty-four elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin], who sit on their thrones before God, prostrated themselves before Him and worshiped, -- revelation 11:16
.
Exclaiming, To You we give thanks, Lord God Omnipotent, [the One] Who is and [ever] was, for assuming the high sovereignty and the great power that are Yours and for beginning to reign. -- revelation 11:17
.
And the heathen (the nations) raged, but Your wrath (retribution, indignation) came, the time when the dead will be judged and Your servants the prophets and saints rewarded--and those who revere (fear) Your name, both low and high and small and great--and [the time] for destroying the corrupters of the earth. -- revelation 11:18
.
Then the sanctuary of God in heaven was thrown open, and the ark of His covenant was seen standing inside in His sanctuary; and there were flashes of lightning, loud rumblings (blasts, mutterings), peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a terrific hailstorm. [I Kings 8:1-6.] -- revelation 11:19
.
AND A great sign (wonder)--[warning of future events of ominous significance] appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and with a crownlike garland (tiara) of twelve stars on her head. -- revelation 12:1
.
She was pregnant and she cried out in her birth pangs, in the anguish of her delivery. -- revelation 12:2
.
Then another ominous sign (wonder) was seen in heaven: Behold, a huge, fiery-red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven kingly crowns (diadems) upon his heads. -- revelation 12:3
.
His tail swept [across the sky] and dragged down a third of the stars and flung them to the earth. And the dragon stationed himself in front of the woman who was about to be delivered, so that he might devour her child as soon as she brought it forth. -- revelation 12:4
.
And she brought forth a male Child, One Who is destined to shepherd (rule) all the nations with an iron staff (scepter), and her Child was caught up to God and to His throne. -- revelation 12:5
.
And the woman [herself] fled into the desert (wilderness), where she has a retreat prepared [for her] by God, in which she is to be fed and kept safe for 1,days (42 months; three and one-half years). -- revelation 12:6
.
Then war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels went forth to battle with the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought. -- revelation 12:7
.
But they were defeated, and there was no room found for them in heaven any longer. -- revelation 12:8
.
And the huge dragon was cast down and out--that age-old serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, he who is the seducer (deceiver) of all humanity the world over; he was forced out and down to the earth, and his angels were flung out along with him. -- revelation 12:9
.
Then I heard a strong (loud) voice in heaven, saying, Now it has come--the salvation and the power and the kingdom (the dominion, the reign) of our God, and the power (the sovereignty, the authority) of His Christ (the Messiah); for the accuser of our brethren, he who keeps bringing before our God charges against them day and night, has been cast out! -- revelation 12:10
.
And they have overcome (conquered) him by means of the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony, for they did not love and cling to life even when faced with death [holding their lives cheap till they had to die for their witnessing]. -- revelation 12:11
.
Therefore be glad (exult), O heavens and you that dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in fierce anger (fury), because he knows that he has [only] a short time [left]! -- revelation 12:12
.
And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male Child. -- revelation 12:13
.
But the woman was supplied with the two wings of a giant eagle, so that she might fly from the presence of the serpent into the desert (wilderness), to the retreat where she is to be kept safe and fed for a time, and times, and half a time (three and one-half years, or 1,days). -- revelation 12:14
.
Then out of his mouth the serpent spouted forth water like a flood after the woman, that she might be carried off with the torrent. -- revelation 12:15
.
But the earth came to the rescue of the woman, and the ground opened its mouth and swallowed up the stream of water which the dragon had spouted from his mouth. -- revelation 12:16
.
So then the dragon was furious (enraged) at the woman, and he went away to wage war on the remainder of her descendants--[on those] who obey God's commandments and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ [and adhere to it and bear witness to Him]. -- revelation 12:17
.
[AS] I stood on the sandy beach, I saw a beast coming up out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On his horns he had ten royal crowns (diadems) and blasphemous titles (names) on his heads. -- revelation 13:1
.
And the beast that I saw resembled a leopard, but his feet were like those of a bear and his mouth was like that of a lion. And to him the dragon gave his [own] might and power and his [own] throne and great dominion. -- revelation 13:2
.
And one of his heads seemed to have a deadly wound. But his death stroke was healed; and the whole earth went after the beast in amazement and admiration. -- revelation 13:3
.
They fell down and paid homage to the dragon, because he had bestowed on the beast all his dominion and authority; they also praised and worshiped the beast, exclaiming, Who is a match for the beast, and, Who can make war against him? -- revelation 13:4
.
And the beast was given the power of speech, uttering boastful and blasphemous words, and he was given freedom to exert his authority and to exercise his will during forty-two months (three and a half years). -- revelation 13:5
.
And he opened his mouth to speak slanders against God, blaspheming His name and His abode, [even vilifying] those who live in heaven. -- revelation 13:6
.
He was further permitted to wage war on God's holy people (the saints) and to overcome them. And power was given him to extend his authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation, -- revelation 13:7
.
And all the inhabitants of the earth will fall down in adoration and pay him homage, everyone whose name has not been recorded in the Book of Life of the Lamb that was slain [in sacrifice] from the foundation of the world. -- revelation 13:8
.
If anyone is able to hear, let him listen: -- revelation 13:9
.
Whoever leads into captivity will himself go into captivity; if anyone slays with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. Herein is [the call for] the patience and the faith and fidelity of the saints (God's people). -- revelation 13:10
.
Then I saw another beast rising up out of the land [itself]; he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke (roared) like a dragon. -- revelation 13:11
.
He exerts all the power and right of control of the former beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell upon it to exalt and deify the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed, and to worship him. -- revelation 13:12
.
He performs great signs (startling miracles), even making fire fall from the sky to the earth in men's sight. -- revelation 13:13
.
And because of the signs (miracles) which he is allowed to perform in the presence of the [first] beast, he deceives those who inhabit the earth, commanding them to erect a statue (an image) in the likeness of the beast who was wounded by the [small] sword and still lived. -- revelation 13:14
.
And he is permitted [also] to impart the breath of life into the beast's image, so that the statue of the beast could actually talk and cause to be put to death those who would not bow down and worship the image of the beast. -- revelation 13:15
.
Also he compels all [alike], both small and great, both the rich and the poor, both free and slave, to be marked with an inscription [stamped] on their right hands or on their foreheads, -- revelation 13:16
.
So that no one will have power to buy or sell unless he bears the stamp (mark, inscription), [that is] the name of the beast or the number of his name. -- revelation 13:17
.
Here is [room for] discernment [a call for the wisdom of interpretation]. Let anyone who has intelligence (penetration and insight enough) calculate the number of the beast, for it is a human number [the number of a certain man]; his number is 666. -- revelation 13:18
.
THEN I looked, and behold, the Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,[men] who had His name and His Father's name inscribed on their foreheads. -- revelation 14:1
.
And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of great waters and like the rumbling of mighty thunder; the voice I heard [seemed like the music] of harpists accompanying themselves on their harps. -- revelation 14:2
.
And they sang a new song before the throne [of God] and before the four living creatures and before the elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin]. No one could learn [to sing] that song except the 144,who had been ransomed (purchased, redeemed) from the earth. -- revelation 14:3
.
These are they who have not defiled themselves by relations with women, for they are [pure as] virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These are they who have been ransomed (purchased, redeemed) from among men as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb. -- revelation 14:4
.
No lie was found to be upon their lips, for they are blameless (spotless, untainted, without blemish) before the throne of God. -- revelation 14:5
.
Then I saw another angel flying in midair, with an eternal Gospel (good news) to tell to the inhabitants of the earth, to every race and tribe and language and people. -- revelation 14:6
.
And he cried with a mighty voice, Revere God and give Him glory (honor and praise in worship), for the hour of His judgment has arrived. Fall down before Him; pay Him homage and adoration and worship Him Who created heaven and earth, the sea and the springs (fountains) of water. -- revelation 14:7
.
Then another angel, a second, followed, declaring, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She who made all nations drink of the [maddening] wine of her passionate unchastity [idolatry]. -- revelation 14:8
.
Then another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a mighty voice, Whoever pays homage to the beast and his statue and permits the [beast's] stamp (mark, inscription) to be put on his forehead or on his hand, -- revelation 14:9
.
He too shall [have to] drink of the wine of God's indignation and wrath, poured undiluted into the cup of His anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. -- revelation 14:10
.
And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no respite (no pause, no intermission, no rest, no peace) day or night--these who pay homage to the beast and to his image and whoever receives the stamp of his name upon him. -- revelation 14:11
.
Here [comes in a call for] the steadfastness of the saints [the patience, the endurance of the people of God], those who [habitually] keep God's commandments and [their] faith in Jesus. -- revelation 14:12
.
Then I heard further [perceiving the distinct words of] a voice from heaven, saying, Write this: Blessed (happy, to be envied) are the dead from now on who die in the Lord! Yes, blessed (happy, to be envied indeed), says the Spirit, [in] that they may rest from their labors, for their works (deeds) do follow (attend, accompany) them! -- revelation 14:13
.
Again I looked, and behold, [I saw] a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud One resembling a Son of Man, with a crown of gold on His head and a sharp scythe (sickle) in His hand. -- revelation 14:14
.
And another angel came out of the temple sanctuary, calling with a mighty voice to Him Who was sitting upon the cloud, Put in Your scythe and reap, for the hour has arrived to gather the harvest, for the earth's crop is fully ripened. -- revelation 14:15
.
So He Who was sitting upon the cloud swung His scythe (sickle) on the earth, and the earth's crop was harvested. -- revelation 14:16
.
Then another angel came out of the temple [sanctuary] in heaven, and he also carried a sharp scythe (sickle). -- revelation 14:17
.
And another angel came forth from the altar, [the angel] who has authority and power over fire, and he called with a loud cry to him who had the sharp scythe (sickle), Put forth your scythe and reap the fruitage of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are entirely ripe. -- revelation 14:18
.
So the angel swung his scythe on the earth and stripped the grapes and gathered the vintage from the vines of the earth and cast it into the huge winepress of God's indignation and wrath. -- revelation 14:19
.
And [the grapes in] the winepress were trodden outside the city, and blood poured from the winepress, [reaching] as high as horses' bridles, for a distance of 1,stadia (about 200 miles). -- revelation 14:20
.
THEN I saw another wonder (sign, token, symbol) in heaven, great and marvelous [warning of events of ominous significance]: There were seven angels bringing seven plagues (afflictions, calamities), which are the last, for with them God's wrath (indignation) is completely expressed [reaches its climax and is ended]. -- revelation 15:1
.
Then I saw what seemed to be a glassy sea blended with fire, and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his statue and from the number corresponding to his name were standing beside the glassy sea, with harps of God in their hands. -- revelation 15:2
.
And they sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, Mighty and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God the Omnipotent! Righteous (just) and true are Your ways, O Sovereign of the ages (King of the nations)! -- revelation 15:3
.
Who shall not reverence and glorify Your name, O Lord [giving You honor and praise in worship]? For You only are holy. All the nations shall come and pay homage and adoration to You, for Your just judgments (Your righteous sentences and deeds) have been made known and displayed. -- revelation 15:4
.
After this I looked and the sanctuary of the tent of the testimony in heaven was thrown open, -- revelation 15:5
.
And there came out of the temple sanctuary the seven angels bringing the seven plagues (afflictions, calamities). They were arrayed in pure gleaming linen, and around their breasts they wore golden girdles. -- revelation 15:6
.
And one of the four living creatures [then] gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath and indignation of God, Who lives forever and ever (in the eternities of the eternities). -- revelation 15:7
.
And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory (the radiance, the splendor) of God and from His might and power, and no one was able to go into the sanctuary until the seven plagues (afflictions, calamities) of the seven angels were ended. [I Kings 8:10; Isa. 6:4; Ezek. 44:4.] -- revelation 15:8
.
THEN I heard a mighty voice from the temple sanctuary saying to the seven angels, Go and empty out on the earth the seven bowls of God's wrath and indignation. -- revelation 16:1
.
So the first [angel] went and emptied his bowl on the earth, and foul and painful ulcers (sores) came on the people who were marked with the stamp of the beast and who did homage to his image. -- revelation 16:2
.
The second [angel] emptied his bowl into the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a corpse [thick, corrupt, ill-smelling, and disgusting], and every living thing that was in the sea perished. -- revelation 16:3
.
Then the third [angel] emptied out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into (became) blood. -- revelation 16:4
.
And I also heard the angel of the waters say, Righteous (just) are You in these Your decisions and judgments, You Who are and were, O Holy One! -- revelation 16:5
.
Because they have poured out the blood of Your people (the saints) and the prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. Such is their due [they deserve it]! -- revelation 16:6
.
And [from] the altar I heard [the] cry, Yes, Lord God the Omnipotent, Your judgments (sentences, decisions) are true and just and righteous! -- revelation 16:7
.
Then the fourth [angel] emptied out his bowl upon the sun, and it was permitted to burn (scorch) humanity with [fierce, glowing] heat (fire). -- revelation 16:8
.
People were severely burned (scorched) by the fiery heat, and they reviled and blasphemed the name of God, Who has control of these plagues, and they did not repent of their sins [felt no regret, contrition, and compunction for their waywardness, refusing to amend their ways] to give Him glory. -- revelation 16:9
.
Then the fifth [angel] emptied his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was [plunged] in darkness; and people gnawed their tongues for the torment [of their excruciating distress and severe pain] -- revelation 16:10
.
And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their anguish and their ulcers (sores), and they did not deplore their wicked deeds or repent [for what they had done]. -- revelation 16:11
.
Then the sixth [angel] emptied his bowl on the mighty river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to make ready a road for [the coming of] the kings of the east (from the rising sun). -- revelation 16:12
.
And I saw three loathsome spirits like frogs, [leaping] from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet. -- revelation 16:13
.
For really they are the spirits of demons that perform signs (wonders, miracles). And they go forth to the rulers and leaders all over the world, to gather them together for war on the great day of God the Almighty. -- revelation 16:14
.
Behold, I am going to come like a thief! Blessed (happy, to be envied) is he who stays awake (alert) and who guards his clothes, so that he may not be naked and [have the shame of being] seen exposed! -- revelation 16:15
.
And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon. [II Kings 9:27.] -- revelation 16:16
.
Then the seventh [angel] emptied out his bowl into the air, and a mighty voice came out of the sanctuary of heaven from the throne [of God], saying, It is done! [It is all over, it is all accomplished, it has come!] -- revelation 16:17
.
And there followed lightning flashes, loud rumblings, peals of thunder, and a tremendous earthquake; nothing like it has ever occurred since men dwelt on the earth, so severe and far-reaching was that earthquake. -- revelation 16:18
.
The mighty city was broken into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And God kept in mind mighty Babylon, to make her drain the cup of His furious wrath and indignation. -- revelation 16:19
.
And every island fled and no mountains could be found. -- revelation 16:20
.
And great (excessively oppressive) hailstones, as heavy as a talent [between fifty and sixty pounds], of immense size, fell from the sky on the people; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail, so very great was [the torture] of that plague. -- revelation 16:21
.
ONE OF the seven angels who had the seven bowls then came and spoke to me, saying, Come with me! I will show you the doom (sentence, judgment) of the great harlot (idolatress) who is seated on many waters, -- revelation 17:1
.
[She] with whom the rulers of the earth have joined in prostitution (idolatry) and with the wine of whose immorality (idolatry) the inhabitants of the earth have become intoxicated. -- revelation 17:2
.
And [the angel] bore me away [rapt] in the Spirit into a desert (wilderness), and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was all covered with blasphemous titles (names), and he had seven heads and ten horns. -- revelation 17:3
.
The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and bedecked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, [and she was] holding in her hand a golden cup full of the accursed offenses and the filth of her lewdness and vice. -- revelation 17:4
.
And on her forehead there was inscribed a name of mystery [with a secret symbolic meaning]: Babylon the great, the mother of prostitutes (idolatresses) and of the filth and atrocities and abominations of the earth. -- revelation 17:5
.
I also saw that the woman was drunk, [drunk] with the blood of the saints (God's people) and the blood of the martyrs [who witnessed] for Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly amazed and wondered greatly. -- revelation 17:6
.
But the angel said to me, Why do you wonder? I will explain to you the [secret symbolic meaning of the] mystery of the woman, as well as of the beast having the seven heads and ten horns that carries her. -- revelation 17:7
.
The beast that you saw [once] was, but [now] is no more, and he is going to come up out of the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and proceed to go to perdition. And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been recorded in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they look at the beast, because he [once] was, but [now] is no more, and he is [yet] to come. -- revelation 17:8
.
This calls for a mind [to consider that is packed] with wisdom and intelligence [it is something for a particular mode of thinking and judging of thoughts, feelings, and purposes]. The seven heads are seven hills upon which the woman is sitting; -- revelation 17:9
.
And they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one still exists [and is reigning]; the other [the seventh] has not yet appeared, and when he does arrive, he must stay [but] a brief time. -- revelation 17:10
.
And as for the beast that [once] was, but now is no more, he [himself] is an eighth ruler (king, head), but he is of the seven and belongs to them, and he goes to perdition. -- revelation 17:11
.
Also the ten horns that you observed are ten rulers (kings) who have as yet received no royal dominion, but together they are to receive power and authority as rulers for a single hour, along with the beast. -- revelation 17:12
.
These have one common policy (opinion, purpose), and they deliver their power and authority to the beast. -- revelation 17:13
.
They will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will triumph over them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings--and those with Him and on His side are chosen and called [elected] and loyal and faithful followers. -- revelation 17:14
.
And [the angel further] said to me, The waters that you observed, where the harlot is seated, are races and multitudes and nations and dialects (languages). -- revelation 17:15
.
And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will [be the very ones to] hate the harlot (the idolatrous woman); they will make her cheerless (bereaved, desolate), and they will strip her and eat up her flesh and utterly consume her with fire. -- revelation 17:16
.
For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His own purpose by acting in harmony in surrendering their royal power and authority to the beast, until the prophetic words (intentions and promises) of God shall be fulfilled. -- revelation 17:17
.
And the woman that you saw is herself the great city which dominates and controls the rulers and the leaders of the earth. -- revelation 17:18
.
THEN I saw another angel descending from heaven, possessing great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his radiance and splendor. -- revelation 18:1
.
And he shouted with a mighty voice, She is fallen! Mighty Babylon is fallen! She has become a resort and dwelling place for demons, a dungeon haunted by every loathsome spirit, an abode for every filthy and detestable bird. -- revelation 18:2
.
For all nations have drunk the wine of her passionate unchastity, and the rulers and leaders of the earth have joined with her in committing fornication (idolatry), and the businessmen of the earth have become rich with the wealth of her excessive luxury and wantonness. -- revelation 18:3
.
I then heard another voice from heaven saying, Come out from her, my people, so that you may not share in her sins, neither participate in her plagues. -- revelation 18:4
.
For her iniquities (her crimes and transgressions) are piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her wickedness and [her] crimes [and calls them up for settlement]. -- revelation 18:5
.
Repay to her what she herself has paid [to others] and double [her doom] in accordance with what she has done. Mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed [for others]. -- revelation 18:6
.
To the degree that she glorified herself and reveled in her wantonness [living deliciously and luxuriously], to that measure impose on her torment and anguish and tears and mourning. Since in her heart she boasts, I am not a widow; as a queen [on a throne] I sit, and I shall never see suffering or experience sorrow-- -- revelation 18:7
.
So shall her plagues (afflictions, calamities) come thick upon her in a single day, pestilence and anguish and sorrow and famine; and she shall be utterly consumed (burned up with fire), for mighty is the Lord God Who judges her. -- revelation 18:8
.
And the rulers and leaders of the earth who joined her in her immorality (idolatry) and luxuriated with her will weep and beat their breasts and lament over her when they see the smoke of her conflagration. -- revelation 18:9
.
They will stand a long way off, in terror of her torment, and they will cry, Woe and alas, the great city, the mighty city, Babylon! In one single hour how your doom (judgment) has overtaken you! -- revelation 18:10
.
And earth's businessmen will weep and grieve over her because no one buys their freight (cargo) any more. -- revelation 18:11
.
Their merchandise is of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; of fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet [stuffs]; all kinds of scented wood, all sorts of articles of ivory, all varieties of objects of costly woods, bronze, iron, and marble; -- revelation 18:12
.
Of cinnamon, spices, incense, ointment and perfume, and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, fine flour and wheat; of cattle and sheep, horses and conveyances; and of slaves (the bodies) and souls of men! -- revelation 18:13
.
The ripe fruits and delicacies for which your soul longed have gone from you, and all your luxuries and dainties, your elegance and splendor are lost to you, never again to be recovered or experienced! -- revelation 18:14
.
The dealers who handled these articles, who grew wealthy through their business with her, will stand a long way off, in terror of her doom and torment, weeping and grieving aloud, and saying, -- revelation 18:15
.
Alas, alas for the great city that was robed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet, bedecked and glittering with gold, with precious stones, and with pearls! -- revelation 18:16
.
Because in one [single] hour all the vast wealth has been destroyed (wiped out). And all ship captains and pilots, navigators and all who live by seafaring, the crews and all who ply their trade on the sea, stood a long way off, -- revelation 18:17
.
And exclaimed as they watched the smoke of her burning, What city could be compared to the great city! -- revelation 18:18
.
And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and grieved, exclaiming, Woe and alas, for the great city, where all who had ships on the sea grew rich [through her extravagance] from her great wealth! In one single hour she has been destroyed and has become a desert! -- revelation 18:19
.
Rejoice (celebrate) over her, O heaven! O saints (people of God) and apostles and prophets, because God has executed vengeance for you upon her! -- revelation 18:20
.
Then a single powerful angel took up a boulder like a great millstone and flung it into the sea, crying, With such violence shall Babylon the great city be hurled down to destruction and shall never again be found. -- revelation 18:21
.
And the sound of harpists and minstrels and flute players and trumpeters shall never again be heard in you, and no skilled artisan of any craft shall ever again be found in you, and the sound of the millstone shall never again be heard in you. -- revelation 18:22
.
And never again shall the light of a lamp shine in you, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall never be heard in you again; for your businessmen were the great and prominent men of the earth, and by your magic spells and poisonous charm all nations were led astray (seduced and deluded). -- revelation 18:23
.
And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all those who have been slain (slaughtered) on earth. -- revelation 18:24
.
AFTER THIS I heard what sounded like a mighty shout of a great crowd in heaven, exclaiming, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! Salvation and glory (splendor and majesty) and power (dominion and authority) [belong] to our God! -- revelation 19:1
.
Because His judgments (His condemnation and punishment, His sentences of doom) are true and sound and just and upright. He has judged (convicted, pronounced sentence, and doomed) the great and notorious harlot (idolatress) who corrupted and demoralized and poisoned the earth with her lewdness and adultery (idolatry). And He has avenged (visited on her the penalty for) the blood of His servants at her hand. -- revelation 19:2
.
And again they shouted, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! The smoke of her [burning] shall continue to ascend forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities). -- revelation 19:3
.
Then the twenty-four elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] and the four living creatures fell prostrate and worshiped [paying divine honors to] God, Who sits on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! -- revelation 19:4
.
Then from the throne there came a voice, saying, Praise our God, all you servants of His, you who reverence Him, both small and great! -- revelation 19:5
.
After that I heard what sounded like the shout of a vast throng, like the boom of many pounding waves, and like the roar of terrific and mighty peals of thunder, exclaiming, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! For now the Lord our God the Omnipotent (the All-Ruler) reigns! -- revelation 19:6
.
Let us rejoice and shout for joy [exulting and triumphant]! Let us celebrate and ascribe to Him glory and honor, for the marriage of the Lamb [at last] has come, and His bride has prepared herself. -- revelation 19:7
.
She has been permitted to dress in fine (radiant) linen, dazzling and white--for the fine linen is (signifies, represents) the righteousness (the upright, just, and godly living, deeds, and conduct, and right standing with God) of the saints (God's holy people). -- revelation 19:8
.
Then [the angel] said to me, Write this down: Blessed (happy, to be envied) are those who are summoned (invited, called) to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me [further], These are the true words (the genuine and exact declarations) of God. -- revelation 19:9
.
Then I fell prostrate at his feet to worship (to pay divine honors) to him, but he [restrained me] and said, Refrain! [You must not do that!] I am [only] another servant with you and your brethren who have [accepted and hold] the testimony borne by Jesus. Worship God! For the substance (essence) of the truth revealed by Jesus is the spirit of all prophecy [the vital breath, the inspiration of all inspired preaching and interpretation of the divine will and purpose, including both mine and yours]. -- revelation 19:10
.
After that I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse [appeared]! The One Who was riding it is called Faithful (Trustworthy, Loyal, Incorruptible, Steady) and True, and He passes judgment and wages war in righteousness (holiness, justice, and uprightness). -- revelation 19:11
.
His eyes [blaze] like a flame of fire, and on His head are many kingly crowns (diadems); and He has a title (name) inscribed which He alone knows or can understand. -- revelation 19:12
.
He is dressed in a robe dyed by dipping in blood, and the title by which He is called is The Word of God. -- revelation 19:13
.
And the troops of heaven, clothed in fine linen, dazzling and clean, followed Him on white horses. -- revelation 19:14
.
From His mouth goes forth a sharp sword with which He can smite (afflict, strike) the nations; and He will shepherd and control them with a staff (scepter, rod) of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath and indignation of God the All-Ruler (the Almighty, the Omnipotent). -- revelation 19:15
.
And on His garment (robe) and on His thigh He has a name (title) inscribed, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. -- revelation 19:16
.
Then I saw a single angel stationed in the sun's light, and with a mighty voice he shouted to all the birds that fly across the sky, Come, gather yourselves together for the great supper of God, -- revelation 19:17
.
That you may feast on the flesh of rulers, the flesh of generals and captains, the flesh of powerful and mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all humanity, both free and slave, both small and great! -- revelation 19:18
.
Then I saw the beast and the rulers and leaders of the earth with their troops mustered to go into battle and make war against Him Who is mounted on the horse and against His troops. -- revelation 19:19
.
And the beast was seized and overpowered, and with him the false prophet who in his presence had worked wonders and performed miracles by which he led astray those who had accepted or permitted to be placed upon them the stamp (mark) of the beast and those who paid homage and gave divine honors to his statue. Both of them were hurled alive into the fiery lake that burns and blazes with brimstone. -- revelation 19:20
.
And the rest were killed with the sword that issues from the mouth of Him Who is mounted on the horse, and all the birds fed ravenously and glutted themselves with their flesh. -- revelation 19:21
.
THEN I saw an angel descending from heaven; he was holding the key of the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and a great chain was in his hand. -- revelation 20:1
.
And he gripped and overpowered the dragon, that old serpent [of primeval times], who is the devil and Satan, and [securely] bound him for a thousand years. -- revelation 20:2
.
Then he hurled him into the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and closed it and sealed it above him, so that he should no longer lead astray and deceive and seduce the nations until the thousand years were at an end. After that he must be liberated for a short time. -- revelation 20:3
.
Then I saw thrones, and sitting on them were those to whom authority to act as judges and to pass sentence was entrusted. Also I saw the souls of those who had been slain with axes [beheaded] for their witnessing to Jesus and [for preaching and testifying] for the Word of God, and who had refused to pay homage to the beast or his statue and had not accepted his mark or permitted it to be stamped on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived again and ruled with Christ (the Messiah) a thousand years. -- revelation 20:4
.
The remainder of the dead were not restored to life again until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection. -- revelation 20:5
.
Blessed (happy, to be envied) and holy (spiritually whole, of unimpaired innocence and proved virtue) is the person who takes part (shares) in the first resurrection! Over them the second death exerts no power or authority, but they shall be ministers of God and of Christ (the Messiah), and they shall rule along with Him a thousand years. -- revelation 20:6
.
And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his place of confinement, -- revelation 20:7
.
And he will go forth to deceive and seduce and lead astray the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth--Gog and Magog--to muster them for war; their number is like the sand of the sea. -- revelation 20:8
.
And they swarmed up over the broad plain of the earth and encircled the fortress (camp) of God's people (the saints) and the beloved city; but fire descended from heaven and consumed them. [II Kings 1:10-12; Ezek. 38:2, 22.] -- revelation 20:9
.
Then the devil who had led them astray [deceiving and seducing them] was hurled into the fiery lake of burning brimstone, where the beast and false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever (through the ages of the ages). -- revelation 20:10
.
Then I saw a great white throne and the One Who was seated upon it, from Whose presence and from the sight of Whose face earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. -- revelation 20:11
.
I [also] saw the dead, great and small; they stood before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is [the Book] of Life. And the dead were judged (sentenced) by what they had done [their whole way of feeling and acting, their aims and endeavors] in accordance with what was recorded in the books. -- revelation 20:12
.
And the sea delivered up the dead who were in it, death and Hades (the state of death or disembodied existence) surrendered the dead in them, and all were tried and their cases determined by what they had done [according to their motives, aims, and works]. -- revelation 20:13
.
Then death and Hades (the state of death or disembodied existence) were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. -- revelation 20:14
.
And if anyone's [name] was not found recorded in the Book of Life, he was hurled into the lake of fire. -- revelation 20:15
.
THEN I saw a new sky (heaven) and a new earth, for the former sky and the former earth had passed away (vanished), and there no longer existed any sea. -- revelation 21:1
.
And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, all arrayed like a bride beautified and adorned for her husband; -- revelation 21:2
.
Then I heard a mighty voice from the throne and I perceived its distinct words, saying, See! The abode of God is with men, and He will live (encamp, tent) among them; and they shall be His people, and God shall personally be with them and be their God. -- revelation 21:3
.
God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more, neither shall there be anguish (sorrow and mourning) nor grief nor pain any more, for the old conditions and the former order of things have passed away. -- revelation 21:4
.
And He Who is seated on the throne said, See! I make all things new. Also He said, Record this, for these sayings are faithful (accurate, incorruptible, and trustworthy) and true (genuine). -- revelation 21:5
.
And He [further] said to me, It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I [Myself] will give water without price from the fountain (springs) of the water of Life. -- revelation 21:6
.
He who is victorious shall inherit all these things, and I will be God to him and he shall be My son. -- revelation 21:7
.
But as for the cowards and the ignoble and the contemptible and the cravenly lacking in courage and the cowardly submissive, and as for the unbelieving and faithless, and as for the depraved and defiled with abominations, and as for murderers and the lewd and adulterous and the practicers of magic arts and the idolaters (those who give supreme devotion to anyone or anything other than God) and all liars (those who knowingly convey untruth by word or deed)--[all of these shall have] their part in the lake that blazes with fire and brimstone. This is the second death. -- revelation 21:8
.
Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven final plagues (afflictions, calamities) came and spoke to me. He said, Come with me! I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife. -- revelation 21:9
.
Then in the Spirit He conveyed me away to a vast and lofty mountain and exhibited to me the holy (hallowed, consecrated) city of Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God, -- revelation 21:10
.
Clothed in God's glory [in all its splendor and radiance]. The luster of it resembled a rare and most precious jewel, like jasper, shining clear as crystal. -- revelation 21:11
.
It had a massive and high wall with twelve [large] gates, and at the gates [there were stationed] twelve angels, and [on the gates] the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were written: -- revelation 21:12
.
On the east side three gates, on the north side three gates, on the south side three gates, and on the west side three gates. -- revelation 21:13
.
And the wall of the city had twelve foundation [stones], and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. -- revelation 21:14
.
And he who spoke to me had a golden measuring reed (rod) to measure the city and its gates and its wall. -- revelation 21:15
.
The city lies in a square, its length being the same as its width. And he measured the city with his reed--12,stadia (about 1,500 miles); its length and width and height are the same. -- revelation 21:16
.
He measured its wall also--cubits (about 72 yards) by a man's measure [of a cubit from his elbow to his third fingertip], which is [the measure] of the angel. -- revelation 21:17
.
The wall was built of jasper, while the city [itself was of] pure gold, clear and transparent like glass. -- revelation 21:18
.
The foundation [stones] of the wall of the city were ornamented with all of the precious stones. The first foundation [stone] was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony (or white agate), the fourth emerald, -- revelation 21:19
.
The fifth onyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. -- revelation 21:20
.
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each separate gate being built of one solid pearl. And the main street (the broadway) of the city was of gold as pure and translucent as glass. -- revelation 21:21
.
I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Omnipotent [Himself] and the Lamb [Himself] are its temple. -- revelation 21:22
.
And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to give light to it, for the splendor and radiance (glory) of God illuminate it, and the Lamb is its lamp. -- revelation 21:23
.
The nations shall walk by its light and the rulers and leaders of the earth shall bring into it their glory. -- revelation 21:24
.
And its gates shall never be closed by day, and there shall be no night there. -- revelation 21:25
.
They shall bring the glory (the splendor and majesty) and the honor of the nations into it. -- revelation 21:26
.
But nothing that defiles or profanes or is unwashed shall ever enter it, nor anyone who commits abominations (unclean, detestable, morally repugnant things) or practices falsehood, but only those whose names are recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life. -- revelation 21:27
.
THEN HE showed me the river whose waters give life, sparkling like crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb -- revelation 22:1
.
Through the middle of the broadway of the city; also, on either side of the river was the tree of life with its twelve varieties of fruit, yielding each month its fresh crop; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing and the restoration of the nations. -- revelation 22:2
.
There shall no longer exist there anything that is accursed (detestable, foul, offensive, impure, hateful, or horrible). But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall worship Him [pay divine honors to Him and do Him holy service]. -- revelation 22:3
.
They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads. -- revelation 22:4
.
And there shall be no more night; they have no need for lamplight or sunlight, for the Lord God will illuminate them and be their light, and they shall reign [as kings] forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities). -- revelation 22:5
.
And he [of the seven angels further] said to me, These statements are reliable (worthy of confidence) and genuine (true). And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His messenger (angel) to make known and exhibit to His servants what must soon come to pass. -- revelation 22:6
.
And behold, I am coming speedily. Blessed (happy and to be envied) is he who observes and lays to heart and keeps the truths of the prophecy (the predictions, consolations, and warnings) contained in this [little] book. -- revelation 22:7
.
And I, John, am he who heard and witnessed these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell prostrate before the feet of the messenger (angel) who showed them to me, to worship him. -- revelation 22:8
.
But he said to me, Refrain! [You must not do that!] I am [only] a fellow servant along with yourself and with your brethren the prophets and with those who are mindful of and practice [the truths contained in] the messages of this book. Worship God! -- revelation 22:9
.
And he [further] told me, Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book and make no secret of them, for the time when things are brought to a crisis and the period of their fulfillment is near. -- revelation 22:10
.
He who is unrighteous (unjust, wicked), let him be unrighteous still; and he who is filthy (vile, impure), let him be filthy still; and he who is righteous (just, upright, in right standing with God), let him do right still; and he who is holy, let him be holy still. -- revelation 22:11
.
Behold, I am coming soon, and I shall bring My wages and rewards with Me, to repay and render to each one just what his own actions and his own work merit. -- revelation 22:12
.
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last (the Before all and the End of all). -- revelation 22:13
.
Blessed (happy and to be envied) are those who cleanse their garments, that they may have the authority and right to [approach] the tree of life and to enter through the gates into the city. -- revelation 22:14
.
[But] without are the dogs and those who practice sorceries (magic arts) and impurity [the lewd, adulterers] and the murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and deals in falsehood (untruth, error, deception, cheating). -- revelation 22:15
.
I, Jesus, have sent My messenger (angel) to you to witness and to give you assurance of these things for the churches (assemblies). I am the Root (the Source) and the Offspring of David, the radiant and brilliant Morning Star. -- revelation 22:16
.
The [Holy] Spirit and the bride (the church, the true Christians) say, Come! And let him who is listening say, Come! And let everyone come who is thirsty [who is painfully conscious of his need of those things by which the soul is refreshed, supported, and strengthened]; and whoever [earnestly] desires to do it, let him come, take, appropriate, and drink the water of Life without cost. -- revelation 22:17
.
I [personally solemnly] warn everyone who listens to the statements of the prophecy [the predictions and the consolations and admonitions pertaining to them] in this book: If anyone shall add anything to them, God will add and lay upon him the plagues (the afflictions and the calamities) that are recorded and described in this book. -- revelation 22:18
.
And if anyone cancels or takes away from the statements of the book of this prophecy [these predictions relating to Christ's kingdom and its speedy triumph, together with the consolations and admonitions or warnings pertaining to them], God will cancel and take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the city of holiness (purity and hallowedness), which are described and promised in this book. -- revelation 22:19
.
He Who gives this warning and affirms and testifies to these things says, Yes (it is true). [Surely] I am coming quickly (swiftly, speedily). Amen (so let it be)! Yes, come, Lord Jesus! -- revelation 22:20
.
The grace (blessing and favor) of the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with all the saints (God's holy people, those set apart for God, to be, as it were, exclusively His). Amen (so let it be)! -- revelation 22:21
.
  -- mark 9:44
.
  -- mark 9:46
.
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, -- ezra 1:1
.
Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. -- ezra 1:2
.
Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. -- ezra 1:3
.
And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. -- ezra 1:4
.
Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem. -- ezra 1:5
.
And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered. -- ezra 1:6
.
Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; -- ezra 1:7
.
Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. -- ezra 1:8
.
And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, -- ezra 1:9
.
Thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. -- ezra 1:10
.
All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. -- ezra 1:11
.
Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city; -- ezra 2:1
.

The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred twenty and eight. -- ezra 2:41
.
The children of the porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, in all an hundred thirty and nine. -- ezra 2:42
.
The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth, -- ezra 2:43
.
The children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon, -- ezra 2:44
.
The children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of Akkub, -- ezra 2:45
.
The children of Hagab, the children of Shalmai, the children of Hanan, -- ezra 2:46
.
The children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of Reaiah, -- ezra 2:47
.
The children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of Gazzam, -- ezra 2:48
.
The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai, -- ezra 2:49
.
The children of Asnah, the children of Mehunim, the children of Nephusim, -- ezra 2:50
.
The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur, -- ezra 2:51
.
The children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha, -- ezra 2:52
.
The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Thamah, -- ezra 2:53
.
The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha. -- ezra 2:54
.
The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda, -- ezra 2:55
.
The children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, -- ezra 2:56
.
The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami. -- ezra 2:57
.
All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two. -- ezra 2:58
.
And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel: -- ezra 2:59
.
The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two. -- ezra 2:60
.
And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name: -- ezra 2:61
.
These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. -- ezra 2:62
.
And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim. -- ezra 2:63
.
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, -- ezra 2:64
.
Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women. -- ezra 2:65
.
Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; -- ezra 2:66
.
Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty. -- ezra 2:67
.
And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place: -- ezra 2:68
.
They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments. -- ezra 2:69
.
So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities. -- ezra 2:70
.
And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. -- ezra 3:1
.
Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. -- ezra 3:2
.
And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening. -- ezra 3:3
.
They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required; -- ezra 3:4
.
And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD. -- ezra 3:5
.
From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid. -- ezra 3:6
.
They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. -- ezra 3:7
.
Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. -- ezra 3:8
.
Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. -- ezra 3:9
.
And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. -- ezra 3:10
.
And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. -- ezra 3:11
.
But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: -- ezra 3:12
.
So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off. -- ezra 3:13
.
Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel; -- ezra 4:1
.
Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. -- ezra 4:2
.
But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. -- ezra 4:3
.
Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, -- ezra 4:4
.
And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. -- ezra 4:5
.
And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. -- ezra 4:6
.
And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue. -- ezra 4:7
.
Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: -- ezra 4:8
.
Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites, -- ezra 4:9
.
And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time. -- ezra 4:10
.
This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time. -- ezra 4:11
.
Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations. -- ezra 4:12
.
Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. -- ezra 4:13
.
Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king; -- ezra 4:14
.
That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. -- ezra 4:15
.
We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. -- ezra 4:16
.
Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time. -- ezra 4:17
.
The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. -- ezra 4:18
.
And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. -- ezra 4:19
.
There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them. -- ezra 4:20
.
Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me. -- ezra 4:21
.
Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? -- ezra 4:22
.
Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. -- ezra 4:23
.
Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. -- ezra 4:24
.
Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them. -- ezra 5:1
.
Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them. -- ezra 5:2
.
At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall? -- ezra 5:3
.
Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? -- ezra 5:4
.
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter. -- ezra 5:5
.
The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: -- ezra 5:6
.
They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace. -- ezra 5:7
.
Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands. -- ezra 5:8
.
Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls? -- ezra 5:9
.
We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them. -- ezra 5:10
.
And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up. -- ezra 5:11
.
But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. -- ezra 5:12
.
But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. -- ezra 5:13
.
And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; -- ezra 5:14
.
And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place. -- ezra 5:15
.
Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished. -- ezra 5:16
.
Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. -- ezra 5:17
.
Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. -- ezra 6:1
.
And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written: -- ezra 6:2
.
In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; -- ezra 6:3
.
With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house: -- ezra 6:4
.
And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God. -- ezra 6:5
.
Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: -- ezra 6:6
.
Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place. -- ezra 6:7
.
Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered. -- ezra 6:8
.
And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: -- ezra 6:9
.
That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. -- ezra 6:10
.
Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. -- ezra 6:11
.
And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed. -- ezra 6:12
.
Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily. -- ezra 6:13
.
And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. -- ezra 6:14
.
And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. -- ezra 6:15
.
And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy. -- ezra 6:16
.
And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. -- ezra 6:17
.
And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. -- ezra 6:18
.
And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. -- ezra 6:19
.
For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. -- ezra 6:20
.
And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat, -- ezra 6:21
.
And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel. -- ezra 6:22
.
Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, -- ezra 7:1
.
The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, -- ezra 7:2
.
The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, -- ezra 7:3
.
The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, -- ezra 7:4
.
The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest: -- ezra 7:5
.
This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. -- ezra 7:6
.
And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. -- ezra 7:7
.
And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. -- ezra 7:8
.
For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. -- ezra 7:9
.
For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments. -- ezra 7:10
.
Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. -- ezra 7:11
.
Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time. -- ezra 7:12
.
I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. -- ezra 7:13
.
Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand; -- ezra 7:14
.
And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, -- ezra 7:15
.
And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: -- ezra 7:16
.
That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. -- ezra 7:17
.
And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. -- ezra 7:18
.
The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. -- ezra 7:19
.
And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house. -- ezra 7:20
.
And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily, -- ezra 7:21
.
Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. -- ezra 7:22
.
Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? -- ezra 7:23
.
Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. -- ezra 7:24
.
And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. -- ezra 7:25
.
And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. -- ezra 7:26
.
Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem: -- ezra 7:27
.
And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me. -- ezra 7:28
.
These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. -- ezra 8:1
.
Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush. -- ezra 8:2
.
Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty. -- ezra 8:3
.
Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males. -- ezra 8:4
.
Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males. -- ezra 8:5
.
Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. -- ezra 8:6
.
And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males. -- ezra 8:7
.
And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males. -- ezra 8:8
.
Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males. -- ezra 8:9
.
And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males. -- ezra 8:10
.
And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males. -- ezra 8:11
.
And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males. -- ezra 8:12
.
And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males. -- ezra 8:13
.
Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males. -- ezra 8:14
.
And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. -- ezra 8:15
.
Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding. -- ezra 8:16
.
And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. -- ezra 8:17
.
And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; -- ezra 8:18
.
And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; -- ezra 8:19
.
Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name. -- ezra 8:20
.
Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. -- ezra 8:21
.
For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. -- ezra 8:22
.
So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us. -- ezra 8:23
.
Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, -- ezra 8:24
.
And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered: -- ezra 8:25
.
I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; -- ezra 8:26
.
Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. -- ezra 8:27
.
And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers. -- ezra 8:28
.
Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. -- ezra 8:29
.
So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God. -- ezra 8:30
.
Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. -- ezra 8:31
.
And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. -- ezra 8:32
.
Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites; -- ezra 8:33
.
By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time. -- ezra 8:34
.
Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD. -- ezra 8:35
.
And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God. -- ezra 8:36
.
Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. -- ezra 9:1
.
For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. -- ezra 9:2
.
And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. -- ezra 9:3
.
Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. -- ezra 9:4
.
And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God, -- ezra 9:5
.
And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens. -- ezra 9:6
.
Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. -- ezra 9:7
.
And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. -- ezra 9:8
.
For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. -- ezra 9:9
.
And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, -- ezra 9:10
.
Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. -- ezra 9:11
.
Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. -- ezra 9:12
.
And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; -- ezra 9:13
.
Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping? -- ezra 9:14
.
O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this. -- ezra 9:15
.
Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore. -- ezra 10:1
.
And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing. -- ezra 10:2
.
Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. -- ezra 10:3
.
Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it. -- ezra 10:4
.
Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware. -- ezra 10:5
.
Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away. -- ezra 10:6
.
And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; -- ezra 10:7
.
And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away. -- ezra 10:8
.
Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain. -- ezra 10:9
.
And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel. -- ezra 10:10
.
Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives. -- ezra 10:11
.
Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do. -- ezra 10:12
.
But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing. -- ezra 10:13
.
Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us. -- ezra 10:14
.
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them. -- ezra 10:15
.
And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. -- ezra 10:16
.
And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month. -- ezra 10:17
.
And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah. -- ezra 10:18
.
And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass. -- ezra 10:19
.
And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah. -- ezra 10:20
.
And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah. -- ezra 10:21
.
And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah. -- ezra 10:22
.
Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. -- ezra 10:23
.
Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri. -- ezra 10:24
.
Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah. -- ezra 10:25
.
And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah. -- ezra 10:26
.
And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza. -- ezra 10:27
.
Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai. -- ezra 10:28
.
And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth. -- ezra 10:29
.
And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh. -- ezra 10:30
.
And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, -- ezra 10:31
.
Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah. -- ezra 10:32
.
Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei. -- ezra 10:33
.
Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel, -- ezra 10:34
.
Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh, -- ezra 10:35
.
Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, -- ezra 10:36
.
Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau, -- ezra 10:37
.
And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei, -- ezra 10:38
.
And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah, -- ezra 10:39
.
Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, -- ezra 10:40
.
Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah, -- ezra 10:41
.
Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph. -- ezra 10:42
.
Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah. -- ezra 10:43
.
All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by whom they had children. -- ezra 10:44
.
The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, -- nehemiah 1:1
.
That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 1:2
.
And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. -- nehemiah 1:3
.
And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, -- nehemiah 1:4
.
And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments: -- nehemiah 1:5
.
Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. -- nehemiah 1:6
.
We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. -- nehemiah 1:7
.
Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations: -- nehemiah 1:8
.
But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. -- nehemiah 1:9
.
Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. -- nehemiah 1:10
.
O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer. -- nehemiah 1:11
.
And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence. -- nehemiah 2:1
.
Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid, -- nehemiah 2:2
.
And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? -- nehemiah 2:3
.
Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. -- nehemiah 2:4
.
And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it. -- nehemiah 2:5
.
And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. -- nehemiah 2:6
.
Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah; -- nehemiah 2:7
.
And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me. -- nehemiah 2:8
.
Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. -- nehemiah 2:9
.
When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. -- nehemiah 2:10
.
So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. -- nehemiah 2:11
.
And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. -- nehemiah 2:12
.
And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. -- nehemiah 2:13
.
Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. -- nehemiah 2:14
.
Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned. -- nehemiah 2:15
.
And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. -- nehemiah 2:16
.
Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach. -- nehemiah 2:17
.
Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work. -- nehemiah 2:18
.
But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king? -- nehemiah 2:19
.
Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 2:20
.
Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel. -- nehemiah 3:1
.
And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri. -- nehemiah 3:2
.
But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. -- nehemiah 3:3
.
And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana. -- nehemiah 3:4
.
And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their LORD. -- nehemiah 3:5
.
Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. -- nehemiah 3:6
.
And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river. -- nehemiah 3:7
.
Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall. -- nehemiah 3:8
.
And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 3:9
.
And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah. -- nehemiah 3:10
.
Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces. -- nehemiah 3:11
.
And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. -- nehemiah 3:12
.
The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate. -- nehemiah 3:13
.
But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. -- nehemiah 3:14
.
But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David. -- nehemiah 3:15
.
After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty. -- nehemiah 3:16
.
After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part. -- nehemiah 3:17
.
After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah. -- nehemiah 3:18
.
And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall. -- nehemiah 3:19
.
After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. -- nehemiah 3:20
.
After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib. -- nehemiah 3:21
.
And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain. -- nehemiah 3:22
.
After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house. -- nehemiah 3:23
.
After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner. -- nehemiah 3:24
.
Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh. -- nehemiah 3:25
.
Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out. -- nehemiah 3:26
.
After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel. -- nehemiah 3:27
.
From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house. -- nehemiah 3:28
.
After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate. -- nehemiah 3:29
.
After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber. -- nehemiah 3:30
.
After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner. -- nehemiah 3:31
.
And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants. -- nehemiah 3:32
.
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. -- nehemiah 4:1
.
And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned? -- nehemiah 4:2
.
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall. -- nehemiah 4:3
.
Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: -- nehemiah 4:4
.
And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders. -- nehemiah 4:5
.
So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work. -- nehemiah 4:6
.
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth, -- nehemiah 4:7
.
And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it. -- nehemiah 4:8
.
Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. -- nehemiah 4:9
.
And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall. -- nehemiah 4:10
.
And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease. -- nehemiah 4:11
.
And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you. -- nehemiah 4:12
.
Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. -- nehemiah 4:13
.
And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses. -- nehemiah 4:14
.
And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work. -- nehemiah 4:15
.
And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. -- nehemiah 4:16
.
They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. -- nehemiah 4:17
.
For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. -- nehemiah 4:18
.
And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another. -- nehemiah 4:19
.
In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us. -- nehemiah 4:20
.
So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. -- nehemiah 4:21
.
Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day. -- nehemiah 4:22
.
So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing. -- nehemiah 4:23
.
And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. -- nehemiah 5:1
.
For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live. -- nehemiah 5:2
.
Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. -- nehemiah 5:3
.
There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards. -- nehemiah 5:4
.
Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards. -- nehemiah 5:5
.
And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. -- nehemiah 5:6
.
Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them. -- nehemiah 5:7
.
And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer. -- nehemiah 5:8
.
Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? -- nehemiah 5:9
.
I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury. -- nehemiah 5:10
.
Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. -- nehemiah 5:11
.
Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. -- nehemiah 5:12
.
Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise. -- nehemiah 5:13
.
Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. -- nehemiah 5:14
.
But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. -- nehemiah 5:15
.
Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. -- nehemiah 5:16
.
Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us. -- nehemiah 5:17
.
Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. -- nehemiah 5:18
.
Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people. -- nehemiah 5:19
.
Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) -- nehemiah 6:1
.
That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. -- nehemiah 6:2
.
And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? -- nehemiah 6:3
.
Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. -- nehemiah 6:4
.
Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; -- nehemiah 6:5
.
Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. -- nehemiah 6:6
.
And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. -- nehemiah 6:7
.
Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. -- nehemiah 6:8
.
For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. -- nehemiah 6:9
.
Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. -- nehemiah 6:10
.
And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. -- nehemiah 6:11
.
And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. -- nehemiah 6:12
.
Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. -- nehemiah 6:13
.
My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. -- nehemiah 6:14
.
So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. -- nehemiah 6:15
.
And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. -- nehemiah 6:16
.
Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. -- nehemiah 6:17
.
For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. -- nehemiah 6:18
.
Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. -- nehemiah 6:19
.
Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, -- nehemiah 7:1
.
That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. -- nehemiah 7:2
.
And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. -- nehemiah 7:3
.
Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. -- nehemiah 7:4
.
And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein, -- nehemiah 7:5
.
These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; -- nehemiah 7:6
.
Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this; -- nehemiah 7:7

.
The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon. -- nehemiah 7:59
.
All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two. -- nehemiah 7:60
.
And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel. -- nehemiah 7:61
.
The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. -- nehemiah 7:62
.
And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name. -- nehemiah 7:63
.
These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. -- nehemiah 7:64
.
And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. -- nehemiah 7:65
.
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, -- nehemiah 7:66
.
Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. -- nehemiah 7:67
.
Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five: -- nehemiah 7:68
.
Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses. -- nehemiah 7:69
.
And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments. -- nehemiah 7:70
.
And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver. -- nehemiah 7:71
.
And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments. -- nehemiah 7:72
.
So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities. -- nehemiah 7:73
.
And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel. -- nehemiah 8:1
.
And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. -- nehemiah 8:2
.
And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law. -- nehemiah 8:3
.
And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. -- nehemiah 8:4
.
And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: -- nehemiah 8:5
.
And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground. -- nehemiah 8:6
.
Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place. -- nehemiah 8:7
.
So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. -- nehemiah 8:8
.
And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. -- nehemiah 8:9
.
Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength. -- nehemiah 8:10
.
So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. -- nehemiah 8:11
.
And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them. -- nehemiah 8:12
.
And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. -- nehemiah 8:13
.
And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month: -- nehemiah 8:14
.
And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. -- nehemiah 8:15
.
So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. -- nehemiah 8:16
.
And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. -- nehemiah 8:17
.
Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner. -- nehemiah 8:18
.
Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them. -- nehemiah 9:1
.
And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. -- nehemiah 9:2
.
And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God. -- nehemiah 9:3
.
Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God. -- nehemiah 9:4
.
Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. -- nehemiah 9:5
.
Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee. -- nehemiah 9:6
.
Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; -- nehemiah 9:7
.
And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous: -- nehemiah 9:8
.
And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea; -- nehemiah 9:9
.
And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day. -- nehemiah 9:10
.
And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters. -- nehemiah 9:11
.
Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. -- nehemiah 9:12
.
Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: -- nehemiah 9:13
.
And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: -- nehemiah 9:14
.
And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them. -- nehemiah 9:15
.
But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments, -- nehemiah 9:16
.
And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not. -- nehemiah 9:17
.
Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; -- nehemiah 9:18
.
Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go. -- nehemiah 9:19
.
Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. -- nehemiah 9:20
.
Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not. -- nehemiah 9:21
.
Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. -- nehemiah 9:22
.
Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. -- nehemiah 9:23
.
So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would. -- nehemiah 9:24
.
And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. -- nehemiah 9:25
.
Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations. -- nehemiah 9:26
.
Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies. -- nehemiah 9:27
.
But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies; -- nehemiah 9:28
.
And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. -- nehemiah 9:29
.
Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands. -- nehemiah 9:30
.
Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. -- nehemiah 9:31
.
Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day. -- nehemiah 9:32
.
Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly: -- nehemiah 9:33
.
Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them. -- nehemiah 9:34
.
For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. -- nehemiah 9:35
.
Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it: -- nehemiah 9:36
.
And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. -- nehemiah 9:37
.
And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it. -- nehemiah 9:38
.

And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding; -- nehemiah 10:28
.
They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes; -- nehemiah 10:29
.
And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, not take their daughters for our sons: -- nehemiah 10:30
.
And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt. -- nehemiah 10:31
.
Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God; -- nehemiah 10:32

For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God. -- nehemiah 10:33

And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law: -- nehemiah 10:34
.
And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD: -- nehemiah 10:35
.
Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God: -- nehemiah 10:36
.
And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. -- nehemiah 10:37
.
And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house. -- nehemiah 10:38
.
For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God. -- nehemiah 10:39

Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, -- nehemiah 12:1

.
Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren. -- nehemiah 12:8
.
Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them in the watches. -- nehemiah 12:9
.
And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada, -- nehemiah 12:10
.
And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua. -- nehemiah 12:11
.
And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; -- nehemiah 12:12
.

.
The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian. -- nehemiah 12:22
.
The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. -- nehemiah 12:23
.
And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward. -- nehemiah 12:24
.
Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates. -- nehemiah 12:25
.
These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe. -- nehemiah 12:26
.
And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. -- nehemiah 12:27
.
And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi; -- nehemiah 12:28
.
Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 12:29
.
And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall. -- nehemiah 12:30
.
Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: -- nehemiah 12:31
.
And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, -- nehemiah 12:32
.
And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, -- nehemiah 12:33
.
Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, -- nehemiah 12:34
.
And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph: -- nehemiah 12:35
.
And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. -- nehemiah 12:36
.
And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. -- nehemiah 12:37
.
And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; -- nehemiah 12:38
.
And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate. -- nehemiah 12:39
.
So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: -- nehemiah 12:40
.
And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; -- nehemiah 12:41
.
And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. -- nehemiah 12:42
.
Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off. -- nehemiah 12:43
.
And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. -- nehemiah 12:44
.
And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. -- nehemiah 12:45
.
For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. -- nehemiah 12:46
.
And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron. -- nehemiah 12:47
.
On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; -- nehemiah 13:1
.
Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing. -- nehemiah 13:2
.
Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. -- nehemiah 13:3
.
And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: -- nehemiah 13:4
.
And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests. -- nehemiah 13:5
.
But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king: -- nehemiah 13:6
.
And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. -- nehemiah 13:7
.
And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber. -- nehemiah 13:8
.
Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense. -- nehemiah 13:9
.
And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field. -- nehemiah 13:10
.
Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. -- nehemiah 13:11
.
Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries. -- nehemiah 13:12
.
And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren. -- nehemiah 13:13
.
Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof. -- nehemiah 13:14
.
In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. -- nehemiah 13:15
.
There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 13:16
.
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? -- nehemiah 13:17
.
Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. -- nehemiah 13:18
.
And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. -- nehemiah 13:19
.
So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. -- nehemiah 13:20
.
Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. -- nehemiah 13:21
.
And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. -- nehemiah 13:22
.
In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab: -- nehemiah 13:23
.
And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people. -- nehemiah 13:24
.
And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. -- nehemiah 13:25
.
Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin. -- nehemiah 13:26
.
Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives? -- nehemiah 13:27
.
And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me. -- nehemiah 13:28
.
Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. -- nehemiah 13:29
.
Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; -- nehemiah 13:30
.
And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good. -- nehemiah 13:31
.
Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:) -- esther 1:1
.
That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace, -- esther 1:2
.
In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: -- esther 1:3
.
When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days. -- esther 1:4
.
And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace; -- esther 1:5
.
Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble. -- esther 1:6
.
And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king. -- esther 1:7
.
And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure. -- esther 1:8
.
Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus. -- esther 1:9
.
On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, -- esther 1:10
.
To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on. -- esther 1:11
.
But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. -- esther 1:12
.
Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment: -- esther 1:13
.
And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) -- esther 1:14
.
What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? -- esther 1:15
.
And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. -- esther 1:16
.
For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. -- esther 1:17
.
Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath. -- esther 1:18
.
If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. -- esther 1:19
.
And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small. -- esther 1:20
.
And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: -- esther 1:21
.
For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people. -- esther 1:22
.
After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. -- esther 2:1
.
Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: -- esther 2:2
.
And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: -- esther 2:3
.
And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. -- esther 2:4
.
Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; -- esther 2:5
.
Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. -- esther 2:6
.
And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. -- esther 2:7
.
So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. -- esther 2:8
.
And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women. -- esther 2:9
.
Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it. -- esther 2:10
.
And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. -- esther 2:11
.
Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;) -- esther 2:12
.
Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. -- esther 2:13
.
In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name. -- esther 2:14
.
Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. -- esther 2:15
.
So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. -- esther 2:16
.
And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. -- esther 2:17
.
Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king. -- esther 2:18
.
And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. -- esther 2:19
.
Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. -- esther 2:20
.
In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. -- esther 2:21
.
And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name. -- esther 2:22
.
And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king. -- esther 2:23
.
After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. -- esther 3:1
.
And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence. -- esther 3:2
.
Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment? -- esther 3:3
.
Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew. -- esther 3:4
.
And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath. -- esther 3:5
.
And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai. -- esther 3:6
.
In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar. -- esther 3:7
.
And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them. -- esther 3:8
.
If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries. -- esther 3:9
.
And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy. -- esther 3:10
.
And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee. -- esther 3:11
.
Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring. -- esther 3:12
.
And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey. -- esther 3:13
.
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day. -- esther 3:14
.
The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed. -- esther 3:15
.
When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; -- esther 4:1
.
And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. -- esther 4:2
.
And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. -- esther 4:3
.
So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not. -- esther 4:4
.
Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was. -- esther 4:5
.
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate. -- esther 4:6
.
And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. -- esther 4:7
.
Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people. -- esther 4:8
.
And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. -- esther 4:9
.
Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai; -- esther 4:10
.
All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days. -- esther 4:11
.
And they told to Mordecai Esther's words. -- esther 4:12
.
Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. -- esther 4:13
.
For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? -- esther 4:14
.
Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, -- esther 4:15
.
Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. -- esther 4:16
.
So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him. -- esther 4:17
.
Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house. -- esther 5:1
.
And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. -- esther 5:2
.
Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom. -- esther 5:3
.
And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him. -- esther 5:4
.
Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. -- esther 5:5
.
And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. -- esther 5:6
.
Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; -- esther 5:7
.
If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said. -- esther 5:8
.
Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. -- esther 5:9
.
Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. -- esther 5:10
.
And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. -- esther 5:11
.
Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king. -- esther 5:12
.
Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate. -- esther 5:13
.
Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made. -- esther 5:14
.
On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. -- esther 6:1
.
And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. -- esther 6:2
.
And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. -- esther 6:3
.
And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. -- esther 6:4
.
And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. -- esther 6:5
.
So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself? -- esther 6:6
.
And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, -- esther 6:7
.
Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head: -- esther 6:8
.
And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour. -- esther 6:9
.
Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. -- esther 6:10
.
Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour. -- esther 6:11
.
And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. -- esther 6:12
.
And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him. -- esther 6:13
.
And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared. -- esther 6:14
.
So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. -- esther 7:1
.
And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom. -- esther 7:2
.
Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: -- esther 7:3
.
For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage. -- esther 7:4
.
Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? -- esther 7:5
.
And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. -- esther 7:6
.
And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. -- esther 7:7
.
Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. -- esther 7:8
.
And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon. -- esther 7:9
.
So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified. -- esther 7:10
.
On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. -- esther 8:1
.
And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. -- esther 8:2
.
And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. -- esther 8:3
.
Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, -- esther 8:4
.
And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces: -- esther 8:5
.
For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? -- esther 8:6
.
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. -- esther 8:7
.
Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse. -- esther 8:8
.
Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language. -- esther 8:9
.
And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries: -- esther 8:10
.
Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, -- esther 8:11
.
Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. -- esther 8:12
.
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. -- esther 8:13
.
So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace. -- esther 8:14
.
And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. -- esther 8:15
.
The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. -- esther 8:16
.
And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them. -- esther 8:17
.
Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) -- esther 9:1
.
The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people. -- esther 9:2
.
And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. -- esther 9:3
.
For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. -- esther 9:4
.
Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them. -- esther 9:5
.
And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. -- esther 9:6
.
And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, -- esther 9:7
.
And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, -- esther 9:8
.
And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha, -- esther 9:9
.
The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. -- esther 9:10
.
On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king. -- esther 9:11
.
And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done. -- esther 9:12
.
Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. -- esther 9:13
.
And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons. -- esther 9:14
.
For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand. -- esther 9:15
.
But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey, -- esther 9:16
.
On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. -- esther 9:17
.
But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. -- esther 9:18
.
Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another. -- esther 9:19
.
And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, -- esther 9:20
.
To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, -- esther 9:21
.
As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. -- esther 9:22
.
And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; -- esther 9:23
.
Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; -- esther 9:24
.
But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. -- esther 9:25
.
Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them, -- esther 9:26
.
The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year; -- esther 9:27
.
And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed. -- esther 9:28
.
Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim. -- esther 9:29
.
And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, -- esther 9:30
.
To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry. -- esther 9:31
.
And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book. -- esther 9:32
.
And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. -- esther 10:1
.
And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? -- esther 10:2
.
For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed. -- esther 10:3
.
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. -- job 1:1
.
And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. -- job 1:2
.
His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. -- job 1:3
.
And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. -- job 1:4
.
And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. -- job 1:5
.
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. -- job 1:6
.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. -- job 1:7
.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? -- job 1:8
.
Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? -- job 1:9
.
Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. -- job 1:10
.
But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. -- job 1:11
.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. -- job 1:12
.
And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: -- job 1:13
.
And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: -- job 1:14
.
And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. -- job 1:15
.
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. -- job 1:16
.
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. -- job 1:17
.
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: -- job 1:18
.
And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. -- job 1:19
.
Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, -- job 1:20
.
And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. -- job 1:21
.
In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. -- job 1:22
.
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. -- job 2:1
.
And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. -- job 2:2
.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. -- job 2:3
.
And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. -- job 2:4
.
But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. -- job 2:5
.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. -- job 2:6
.
So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. -- job 2:7
.
And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. -- job 2:8
.
Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. -- job 2:9
.
But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. -- job 2:10
.
Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. -- job 2:11
.
And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. -- job 2:12
.
So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great. -- job 2:13
.
After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. -- job 3:1
.
And Job spake, and said, -- job 3:2
.
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. -- job 3:3
.
Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. -- job 3:4
.
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. -- job 3:5
.
As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. -- job 3:6
.
Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. -- job 3:7
.
Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. -- job 3:8
.
Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: -- job 3:9
.
Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. -- job 3:10
.
Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? -- job 3:11
.
Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? -- job 3:12
.
For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, -- job 3:13
.
With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves; -- job 3:14
.
Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: -- job 3:15
.
Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. -- job 3:16
.
There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. -- job 3:17
.
There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. -- job 3:18
.
The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. -- job 3:19
.
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; -- job 3:20
.
Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; -- job 3:21
.
Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? -- job 3:22
.
Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? -- job 3:23
.
For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. -- job 3:24
.
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. -- job 3:25
.
I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. -- job 3:26
.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, -- job 4:1
.
If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? -- job 4:2
.
Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. -- job 4:3
.
Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. -- job 4:4
.
But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. -- job 4:5
.
Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? -- job 4:6
.
Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? -- job 4:7
.
Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. -- job 4:8
.
By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. -- job 4:9
.
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. -- job 4:10
.
The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad. -- job 4:11
.
Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof. -- job 4:12
.
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, -- job 4:13
.
Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. -- job 4:14
.
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: -- job 4:15
.
It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, -- job 4:16
.
Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? -- job 4:17
.
Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: -- job 4:18
.
How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? -- job 4:19
.
They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it. -- job 4:20
.
Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom. -- job 4:21
.
Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? -- job 5:1
.
For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. -- job 5:2
.
I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. -- job 5:3
.
His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them. -- job 5:4
.
Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. -- job 5:5
.
Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; -- job 5:6
.
Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. -- job 5:7
.
I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: -- job 5:8
.
Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: -- job 5:9
.
Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: -- job 5:10
.
To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. -- job 5:11
.
He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. -- job 5:12
.
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. -- job 5:13
.
They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night. -- job 5:14
.
But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. -- job 5:15
.
So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. -- job 5:16
.
Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: -- job 5:17
.
For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. -- job 5:18
.
He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. -- job 5:19
.
In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword. -- job 5:20
.
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. -- job 5:21
.
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. -- job 5:22
.
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. -- job 5:23
.
And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. -- job 5:24
.
Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. -- job 5:25
.
Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. -- job 5:26
.
Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good. -- job 5:27
.
But Job answered and said, -- job 6:1
.
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! -- job 6:2
.
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. -- job 6:3
.
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. -- job 6:4
.
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? -- job 6:5
.
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? -- job 6:6
.
The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. -- job 6:7
.
Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! -- job 6:8
.
Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! -- job 6:9
.
Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. -- job 6:10
.
What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? -- job 6:11
.
Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? -- job 6:12
.
Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? -- job 6:13
.
To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. -- job 6:14
.
My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; -- job 6:15
.
Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: -- job 6:16
.
What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. -- job 6:17
.
The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. -- job 6:18
.
The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. -- job 6:19
.
They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. -- job 6:20
.
For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. -- job 6:21
.
Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? -- job 6:22
.
Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? -- job 6:23
.
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. -- job 6:24
.
How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? -- job 6:25
.
Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? -- job 6:26
.
Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. -- job 6:27
.
Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. -- job 6:28
.
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. -- job 6:29
.
Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? -- job 6:30
.
Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling? -- job 7:1
.
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work: -- job 7:2
.
So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. -- job 7:3
.
When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. -- job 7:4
.
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. -- job 7:5
.
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. -- job 7:6
.
O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. -- job 7:7
.
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not. -- job 7:8
.
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. -- job 7:9
.
He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. -- job 7:10
.
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. -- job 7:11
.
Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? -- job 7:12
.
When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints; -- job 7:13
.
Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: -- job 7:14
.
So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. -- job 7:15
.
I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity. -- job 7:16
.
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? -- job 7:17
.
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? -- job 7:18
.
How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? -- job 7:19
.
I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? -- job 7:20
.
And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be. -- job 7:21
.
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, -- job 8:1
.
How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? -- job 8:2
.
Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? -- job 8:3
.
If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; -- job 8:4
.
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; -- job 8:5
.
If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. -- job 8:6
.
Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. -- job 8:7
.
For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: -- job 8:8
.
(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) -- job 8:9
.
Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? -- job 8:10
.
Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? -- job 8:11
.
Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. -- job 8:12
.
So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: -- job 8:13
.
Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. -- job 8:14
.
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. -- job 8:15
.
He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. -- job 8:16
.
His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. -- job 8:17
.
If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. -- job 8:18
.
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. -- job 8:19
.
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers: -- job 8:20
.
Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. -- job 8:21
.
They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. -- job 8:22
.
Then Job answered and said, -- job 9:1
.
I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? -- job 9:2
.
If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. -- job 9:3
.
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? -- job 9:4
.
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. -- job 9:5
.
Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. -- job 9:6
.
Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. -- job 9:7
.
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. -- job 9:8
.
Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. -- job 9:9
.
Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. -- job 9:10
.
Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. -- job 9:11
.
Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? -- job 9:12
.
If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. -- job 9:13
.
How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? -- job 9:14
.
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. -- job 9:15
.
If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. -- job 9:16
.
For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. -- job 9:17
.
He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. -- job 9:18
.
If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? -- job 9:19
.
If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. -- job 9:20
.
Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. -- job 9:21
.
This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. -- job 9:22
.
If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. -- job 9:23
.
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? -- job 9:24
.
Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. -- job 9:25
.
They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. -- job 9:26
.
If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: -- job 9:27
.
I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. -- job 9:28
.
If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? -- job 9:29
.
If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; -- job 9:30
.
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. -- job 9:31
.
For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. -- job 9:32
.
Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. -- job 9:33
.
Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: -- job 9:34
.
Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me. -- job 9:35
.
My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. -- job 10:1
.
I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. -- job 10:2
.
Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? -- job 10:3
.
Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? -- job 10:4
.
Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days, -- job 10:5
.
That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? -- job 10:6
.
Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. -- job 10:7
.
Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. -- job 10:8
.
Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? -- job 10:9
.
Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? -- job 10:10
.
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. -- job 10:11
.
Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. -- job 10:12
.
And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee. -- job 10:13
.
If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. -- job 10:14
.
If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; -- job 10:15
.
For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me. -- job 10:16
.
Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me. -- job 10:17
.
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! -- job 10:18
.
I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. -- job 10:19
.
Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, -- job 10:20
.
Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; -- job 10:21
.
A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness. -- job 10:22
.
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, -- job 11:1
.
Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? -- job 11:2
.
Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? -- job 11:3
.
For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. -- job 11:4
.
But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; -- job 11:5
.
And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. -- job 11:6
.
Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? -- job 11:7
.
It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? -- job 11:8
.
The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. -- job 11:9
.
If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? -- job 11:10
.
For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? -- job 11:11
.
For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt. -- job 11:12
.
If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; -- job 11:13
.
If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. -- job 11:14
.
For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: -- job 11:15
.
Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: -- job 11:16
.
And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. -- job 11:17
.
And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. -- job 11:18
.
Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. -- job 11:19
.
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost. -- job 11:20
.
And Job answered and said, -- job 12:1
.
No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. -- job 12:2
.
But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? -- job 12:3
.
I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn. -- job 12:4
.
He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. -- job 12:5
.
The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. -- job 12:6
.
But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: -- job 12:7
.
Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. -- job 12:8
.
Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? -- job 12:9
.
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. -- job 12:10
.
Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? -- job 12:11
.
With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. -- job 12:12
.
With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. -- job 12:13
.
Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. -- job 12:14
.
Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. -- job 12:15
.
With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his. -- job 12:16
.
He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. -- job 12:17
.
He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. -- job 12:18
.
He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. -- job 12:19
.
He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. -- job 12:20
.
He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. -- job 12:21
.
He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. -- job 12:22
.
He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again. -- job 12:23
.
He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. -- job 12:24
.
They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man. -- job 12:25
.
Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it. -- job 13:1
.
What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. -- job 13:2
.
Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. -- job 13:3
.
But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value. -- job 13:4
.
O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. -- job 13:5
.
Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. -- job 13:6
.
Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? -- job 13:7
.
Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? -- job 13:8
.
Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him? -- job 13:9
.
He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. -- job 13:10
.
Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? -- job 13:11
.
Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. -- job 13:12
.
Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will. -- job 13:13
.
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? -- job 13:14
.
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. -- job 13:15
.
He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him. -- job 13:16
.
Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. -- job 13:17
.
Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified. -- job 13:18
.
Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. -- job 13:19
.
Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee. -- job 13:20
.
Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. -- job 13:21
.
Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. -- job 13:22
.
How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin. -- job 13:23
.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? -- job 13:24
.
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? -- job 13:25
.
For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. -- job 13:26
.
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. -- job 13:27
.
And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten. -- job 13:28
.
Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. -- job 14:1
.
He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. -- job 14:2
.
And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? -- job 14:3
.
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. -- job 14:4
.
Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; -- job 14:5
.
Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. -- job 14:6
.
For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. -- job 14:7
.
Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; -- job 14:8
.
Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. -- job 14:9
.
But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? -- job 14:10
.
As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: -- job 14:11
.
So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. -- job 14:12
.
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! -- job 14:13
.
If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. -- job 14:14
.
Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. -- job 14:15
.
For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? -- job 14:16
.
My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. -- job 14:17
.
And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. -- job 14:18
.
The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. -- job 14:19
.
Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. -- job 14:20
.
His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. -- job 14:21
.
But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn. -- job 14:22
.
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, -- job 15:1
.
Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? -- job 15:2
.
Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? -- job 15:3
.
Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. -- job 15:4
.
For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. -- job 15:5
.
Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. -- job 15:6
.
Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? -- job 15:7
.
Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? -- job 15:8
.
What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? -- job 15:9
.
With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. -- job 15:10
.
Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? -- job 15:11
.
Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, -- job 15:12
.
That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? -- job 15:13
.
What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? -- job 15:14
.
Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. -- job 15:15
.
How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? -- job 15:16
.
I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; -- job 15:17
.
Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it: -- job 15:18
.
Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them. -- job 15:19
.
The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. -- job 15:20
.
A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. -- job 15:21
.
He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. -- job 15:22
.
He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. -- job 15:23
.
Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. -- job 15:24
.
For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. -- job 15:25
.
He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: -- job 15:26
.
Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. -- job 15:27
.
And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. -- job 15:28
.
He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. -- job 15:29
.
He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. -- job 15:30
.
Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. -- job 15:31
.
It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. -- job 15:32
.
He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. -- job 15:33
.
For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. -- job 15:34
.
They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. -- job 15:35
.
Then Job answered and said, -- job 16:1
.
I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. -- job 16:2
.
Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? -- job 16:3
.
I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. -- job 16:4
.
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief. -- job 16:5
.
Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased? -- job 16:6
.
But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. -- job 16:7
.
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. -- job 16:8
.
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. -- job 16:9
.
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. -- job 16:10
.
God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. -- job 16:11
.
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. -- job 16:12
.
His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. -- job 16:13
.
He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. -- job 16:14
.
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. -- job 16:15
.
My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; -- job 16:16
.
Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure. -- job 16:17
.
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. -- job 16:18
.
Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high. -- job 16:19
.
My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God. -- job 16:20
.
O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour! -- job 16:21
.
When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return. -- job 16:22
.
My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me. -- job 17:1
.
Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? -- job 17:2
.
Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me? -- job 17:3
.
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. -- job 17:4
.
He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. -- job 17:5
.
He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. -- job 17:6
.
Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. -- job 17:7
.
Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. -- job 17:8
.
The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. -- job 17:9
.
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you. -- job 17:10
.
My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. -- job 17:11
.
They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness. -- job 17:12
.
If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. -- job 17:13
.
I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. -- job 17:14
.
And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? -- job 17:15
.
They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust. -- job 17:16
.
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, -- job 18:1
.
How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak. -- job 18:2
.
Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? -- job 18:3
.
He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? -- job 18:4
.
Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. -- job 18:5
.
The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him. -- job 18:6
.
The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. -- job 18:7
.
For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. -- job 18:8
.
The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him. -- job 18:9
.
The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. -- job 18:10
.
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. -- job 18:11
.
His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side. -- job 18:12
.
It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. -- job 18:13
.
His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. -- job 18:14
.
It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. -- job 18:15
.
His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. -- job 18:16
.
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. -- job 18:17
.
He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. -- job 18:18
.
He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. -- job 18:19
.
They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. -- job 18:20
.
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God. -- job 18:21
.
Then Job answered and said, -- job 19:1
.
How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? -- job 19:2
.
These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. -- job 19:3
.
And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. -- job 19:4
.
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: -- job 19:5
.
Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. -- job 19:6
.
Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. -- job 19:7
.
He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. -- job 19:8
.
He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. -- job 19:9
.
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree. -- job 19:10
.
He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. -- job 19:11
.
His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. -- job 19:12
.
He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. -- job 19:13
.
My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. -- job 19:14
.
They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. -- job 19:15
.
I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. -- job 19:16
.
My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body. -- job 19:17
.
Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. -- job 19:18
.
All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. -- job 19:19
.
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. -- job 19:20
.
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. -- job 19:21
.
Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? -- job 19:22
.
Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! -- job 19:23
.
That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! -- job 19:24
.
For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: -- job 19:25
.
And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: -- job 19:26
.
Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. -- job 19:27
.
But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? -- job 19:28
.
Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment. -- job 19:29
.
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, -- job 20:1
.
Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. -- job 20:2
.
I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. -- job 20:3
.
Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, -- job 20:4
.
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? -- job 20:5
.
Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; -- job 20:6
.
Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? -- job 20:7
.
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. -- job 20:8
.
The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. -- job 20:9
.
His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. -- job 20:10
.
His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. -- job 20:11
.
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; -- job 20:12
.
Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: -- job 20:13
.
Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. -- job 20:14
.
He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. -- job 20:15
.
He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. -- job 20:16
.
He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. -- job 20:17
.
That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein. -- job 20:18
.
Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; -- job 20:19
.
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. -- job 20:20
.
There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. -- job 20:21
.
In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. -- job 20:22
.
When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. -- job 20:23
.
He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through. -- job 20:24
.
It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him. -- job 20:25
.
All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. -- job 20:26
.
The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. -- job 20:27
.
The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. -- job 20:28
.
This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. -- job 20:29
.
But Job answered and said, -- job 21:1
.
Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. -- job 21:2
.
Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. -- job 21:3
.
As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? -- job 21:4
.
Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. -- job 21:5
.
Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. -- job 21:6
.
Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? -- job 21:7
.
Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. -- job 21:8
.
Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. -- job 21:9
.
Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. -- job 21:10
.
They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. -- job 21:11
.
They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. -- job 21:12
.
They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. -- job 21:13
.
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. -- job 21:14
.
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? -- job 21:15
.
Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. -- job 21:16
.
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. -- job 21:17
.
They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. -- job 21:18
.
God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. -- job 21:19
.
His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. -- job 21:20
.
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? -- job 21:21
.
Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. -- job 21:22
.
One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. -- job 21:23
.
His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. -- job 21:24
.
And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. -- job 21:25
.
They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. -- job 21:26
.
Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. -- job 21:27
.
For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? -- job 21:28
.
Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, -- job 21:29
.
That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. -- job 21:30
.
Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? -- job 21:31
.
Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. -- job 21:32
.
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. -- job 21:33
.
How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? -- job 21:34
.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, -- job 22:1
.
Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? -- job 22:2
.
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? -- job 22:3
.
Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? -- job 22:4
.
Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? -- job 22:5
.
For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. -- job 22:6
.
Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. -- job 22:7
.
But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. -- job 22:8
.
Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. -- job 22:9
.
Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; -- job 22:10
.
Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. -- job 22:11
.
Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! -- job 22:12
.
And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? -- job 22:13
.
Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. -- job 22:14
.
Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? -- job 22:15
.
Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: -- job 22:16
.
Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? -- job 22:17
.
Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. -- job 22:18
.
The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. -- job 22:19
.
Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. -- job 22:20
.
Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. -- job 22:21
.
Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. -- job 22:22
.
If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. -- job 22:23
.
Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. -- job 22:24
.
Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. -- job 22:25
.
For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. -- job 22:26
.
Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. -- job 22:27
.
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. -- job 22:28
.
When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. -- job 22:29
.
He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. -- job 22:30
.
Then Job answered and said, -- job 23:1
.
Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. -- job 23:2
.
Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! -- job 23:3
.
I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. -- job 23:4
.
I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. -- job 23:5
.
Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. -- job 23:6
.
There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. -- job 23:7
.
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: -- job 23:8
.
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: -- job 23:9
.
But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. -- job 23:10
.
My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. -- job 23:11
.
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. -- job 23:12
.
But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. -- job 23:13
.
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. -- job 23:14
.
Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. -- job 23:15
.
For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: -- job 23:16
.
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. -- job 23:17
.
Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? -- job 24:1
.
Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. -- job 24:2
.
They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. -- job 24:3
.
They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. -- job 24:4
.
Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. -- job 24:5
.
They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. -- job 24:6
.
They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. -- job 24:7
.
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. -- job 24:8
.
They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. -- job 24:9
.
They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; -- job 24:10
.
Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. -- job 24:11
.
Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. -- job 24:12
.
They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. -- job 24:13
.
The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. -- job 24:14
.
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. -- job 24:15
.
In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. -- job 24:16
.
For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. -- job 24:17
.
He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. -- job 24:18
.
Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. -- job 24:19
.
The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. -- job 24:20
.
He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. -- job 24:21
.
He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. -- job 24:22
.
Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. -- job 24:23
.
They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. -- job 24:24
.
And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? -- job 24:25
.
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, -- job 25:1
.
Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. -- job 25:2
.
Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? -- job 25:3
.
How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? -- job 25:4
.
Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. -- job 25:5
.
How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? -- job 25:6
.
But Job answered and said, -- job 26:1
.
How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? -- job 26:2
.
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? -- job 26:3
.
To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? -- job 26:4
.
Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. -- job 26:5
.
Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. -- job 26:6
.
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. -- job 26:7
.
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. -- job 26:8
.
He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. -- job 26:9
.
He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. -- job 26:10
.
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. -- job 26:11
.
He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. -- job 26:12
.
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. -- job 26:13
.
Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? -- job 26:14
.
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, -- job 27:1
.
As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; -- job 27:2
.
All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; -- job 27:3
.
My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. -- job 27:4
.
God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. -- job 27:5
.
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. -- job 27:6
.
Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. -- job 27:7
.
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? -- job 27:8
.
Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? -- job 27:9
.
Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? -- job 27:10
.
I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. -- job 27:11
.
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? -- job 27:12
.
This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty. -- job 27:13
.
If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. -- job 27:14
.
Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. -- job 27:15
.
Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; -- job 27:16
.
He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. -- job 27:17
.
He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh. -- job 27:18
.
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not. -- job 27:19
.
Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. -- job 27:20
.
The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. -- job 27:21
.
For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. -- job 27:22
.
Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. -- job 27:23
.
Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. -- job 28:1
.
Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. -- job 28:2
.
He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. -- job 28:3
.
The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. -- job 28:4
.
As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. -- job 28:5
.
The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. -- job 28:6
.
There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: -- job 28:7
.
The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. -- job 28:8
.
He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. -- job 28:9
.
He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. -- job 28:10
.
He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. -- job 28:11
.
But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? -- job 28:12
.
Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. -- job 28:13
.
The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. -- job 28:14
.
It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. -- job 28:15
.
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. -- job 28:16
.
The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. -- job 28:17
.
No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. -- job 28:18
.
The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. -- job 28:19
.
Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? -- job 28:20
.
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. -- job 28:21
.
Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. -- job 28:22
.
God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. -- job 28:23
.
For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; -- job 28:24
.
To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. -- job 28:25
.
When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: -- job 28:26
.
Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. -- job 28:27
.
And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. -- job 28:28
.
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, -- job 29:1
.
Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; -- job 29:2
.
When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; -- job 29:3
.
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; -- job 29:4
.
When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; -- job 29:5
.
When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; -- job 29:6
.
When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! -- job 29:7
.
The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. -- job 29:8
.
The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. -- job 29:9
.
The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. -- job 29:10
.
When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: -- job 29:11
.
Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. -- job 29:12
.
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. -- job 29:13
.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. -- job 29:14
.
I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. -- job 29:15
.
I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. -- job 29:16
.
And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. -- job 29:17
.
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. -- job 29:18
.
My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. -- job 29:19
.
My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. -- job 29:20
.
Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. -- job 29:21
.
After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. -- job 29:22
.
And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. -- job 29:23
.
If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. -- job 29:24
.
I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. -- job 29:25
.
But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. -- job 30:1
.
Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished? -- job 30:2
.
For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. -- job 30:3
.
Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat. -- job 30:4
.
They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;) -- job 30:5
.
To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks. -- job 30:6
.
Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. -- job 30:7
.
They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. -- job 30:8
.
And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. -- job 30:9
.
They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. -- job 30:10
.
Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. -- job 30:11
.
Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. -- job 30:12
.
They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. -- job 30:13
.
They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me. -- job 30:14
.
Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. -- job 30:15
.
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. -- job 30:16
.
My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. -- job 30:17
.
By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. -- job 30:18
.
He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. -- job 30:19
.
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. -- job 30:20
.
Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. -- job 30:21
.
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance. -- job 30:22
.
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. -- job 30:23
.
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. -- job 30:24
.
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor? -- job 30:25
.
When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. -- job 30:26
.
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me. -- job 30:27
.
I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation. -- job 30:28
.
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. -- job 30:29
.
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. -- job 30:30
.
My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep. -- job 30:31
.
I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? -- job 31:1
.
For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? -- job 31:2
.
Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? -- job 31:3
.
Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? -- job 31:4
.
If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; -- job 31:5
.
Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity. -- job 31:6
.
If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; -- job 31:7
.
Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. -- job 31:8
.
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; -- job 31:9
.
Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. -- job 31:10
.
For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. -- job 31:11
.
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. -- job 31:12
.
If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; -- job 31:13
.
What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? -- job 31:14
.
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? -- job 31:15
.
If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; -- job 31:16
.
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; -- job 31:17
.
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) -- job 31:18
.
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; -- job 31:19
.
If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; -- job 31:20
.
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: -- job 31:21
.
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. -- job 31:22
.
For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. -- job 31:23
.
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; -- job 31:24
.
If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; -- job 31:25
.
If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; -- job 31:26
.
And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: -- job 31:27
.
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. -- job 31:28
.
If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: -- job 31:29
.
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. -- job 31:30
.
If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. -- job 31:31
.
The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller. -- job 31:32
.
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: -- job 31:33
.
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? -- job 31:34
.
Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. -- job 31:35
.
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. -- job 31:36
.
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. -- job 31:37
.
If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; -- job 31:38
.
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: -- job 31:39
.
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. -- job 31:40
.
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. -- job 32:1
.
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. -- job 32:2
.
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. -- job 32:3
.
Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. -- job 32:4
.
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. -- job 32:5
.
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. -- job 32:6
.
I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. -- job 32:7
.
But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. -- job 32:8
.
Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. -- job 32:9
.
Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. -- job 32:10
.
Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. -- job 32:11
.
Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: -- job 32:12
.
Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. -- job 32:13
.
Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. -- job 32:14
.
They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. -- job 32:15
.
When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) -- job 32:16
.
I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. -- job 32:17
.
For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. -- job 32:18
.
Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. -- job 32:19
.
I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. -- job 32:20
.
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. -- job 32:21
.
For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away. -- job 32:22
.
Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. -- job 33:1
.
Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. -- job 33:2
.
My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. -- job 33:3
.
The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. -- job 33:4
.
If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up. -- job 33:5
.
Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. -- job 33:6
.
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. -- job 33:7
.
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, -- job 33:8
.
I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. -- job 33:9
.
Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, -- job 33:10
.
He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. -- job 33:11
.
Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. -- job 33:12
.
Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. -- job 33:13
.
For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. -- job 33:14
.
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; -- job 33:15
.
Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, -- job 33:16
.
That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. -- job 33:17
.
He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. -- job 33:18
.
He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: -- job 33:19
.
So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. -- job 33:20
.
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. -- job 33:21
.
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. -- job 33:22
.
If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: -- job 33:23
.
Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. -- job 33:24
.
His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: -- job 33:25
.
He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. -- job 33:26
.
He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; -- job 33:27
.
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. -- job 33:28
.
Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, -- job 33:29
.
To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. -- job 33:30
.
Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. -- job 33:31
.
If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. -- job 33:32
.
If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. -- job 33:33
.
Furthermore Elihu answered and said, -- job 34:1
.
Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. -- job 34:2
.
For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. -- job 34:3
.
Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good. -- job 34:4
.
For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. -- job 34:5
.
Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. -- job 34:6
.
What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? -- job 34:7
.
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. -- job 34:8
.
For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. -- job 34:9
.
Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. -- job 34:10
.
For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. -- job 34:11
.
Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. -- job 34:12
.
Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? -- job 34:13
.
If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; -- job 34:14
.
All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. -- job 34:15
.
If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. -- job 34:16
.
Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? -- job 34:17
.
Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? -- job 34:18
.
How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. -- job 34:19
.
In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. -- job 34:20
.
For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. -- job 34:21
.
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. -- job 34:22
.
For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. -- job 34:23
.
He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. -- job 34:24
.
Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. -- job 34:25
.
He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; -- job 34:26
.
Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: -- job 34:27
.
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. -- job 34:28
.
When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: -- job 34:29
.
That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. -- job 34:30
.
Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: -- job 34:31
.
That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. -- job 34:32
.
Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. -- job 34:33
.
Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. -- job 34:34
.
Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. -- job 34:35
.
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. -- job 34:36
.
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God. -- job 34:37
.
Elihu spake moreover, and said, -- job 35:1
.
Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's? -- job 35:2
.
For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? -- job 35:3
.
I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. -- job 35:4
.
Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. -- job 35:5
.
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? -- job 35:6
.
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? -- job 35:7
.
Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. -- job 35:8
.
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. -- job 35:9
.
But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; -- job 35:10
.
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? -- job 35:11
.
There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. -- job 35:12
.
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. -- job 35:13
.
Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him. -- job 35:14
.
But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: -- job 35:15
.
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. -- job 35:16
.
Elihu also proceeded, and said, -- job 36:1
.
Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf. -- job 36:2
.
I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. -- job 36:3
.
For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. -- job 36:4
.
Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. -- job 36:5
.
He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. -- job 36:6
.
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. -- job 36:7
.
And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; -- job 36:8
.
Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. -- job 36:9
.
He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. -- job 36:10
.
If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. -- job 36:11
.
But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. -- job 36:12
.
But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. -- job 36:13
.
They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. -- job 36:14
.
He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. -- job 36:15
.
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. -- job 36:16
.
But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee. -- job 36:17
.
Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. -- job 36:18
.
Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. -- job 36:19
.
Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. -- job 36:20
.
Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. -- job 36:21
.
Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? -- job 36:22
.
Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? -- job 36:23
.
Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. -- job 36:24
.
Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. -- job 36:25
.
Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. -- job 36:26
.
For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: -- job 36:27
.
Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. -- job 36:28
.
Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? -- job 36:29
.
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. -- job 36:30
.
For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. -- job 36:31
.
With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. -- job 36:32
.
The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. -- job 36:33
.
At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. -- job 37:1
.
Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. -- job 37:2
.
He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. -- job 37:3
.
After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. -- job 37:4
.
God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. -- job 37:5
.
For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. -- job 37:6
.
He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. -- job 37:7
.
Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. -- job 37:8
.
Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. -- job 37:9
.
By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. -- job 37:10
.
Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: -- job 37:11
.
And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. -- job 37:12
.
He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. -- job 37:13
.
Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. -- job 37:14
.
Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? -- job 37:15
.
Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? -- job 37:16
.
How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? -- job 37:17
.
Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass? -- job 37:18
.
Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. -- job 37:19
.
Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. -- job 37:20
.
And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. -- job 37:21
.
Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty. -- job 37:22
.
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict. -- job 37:23
.
Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. -- job 37:24
.
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, -- job 38:1
.
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? -- job 38:2
.
Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. -- job 38:3
.
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. -- job 38:4
.
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? -- job 38:5
.
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; -- job 38:6
.
When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? -- job 38:7
.
Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? -- job 38:8
.
When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, -- job 38:9
.
And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, -- job 38:10
.
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? -- job 38:11
.
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; -- job 38:12
.
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? -- job 38:13
.
It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. -- job 38:14
.
And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken. -- job 38:15
.
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? -- job 38:16
.
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? -- job 38:17
.
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. -- job 38:18
.
Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, -- job 38:19
.
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? -- job 38:20
.
Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? -- job 38:21
.
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, -- job 38:22
.
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? -- job 38:23
.
By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? -- job 38:24
.
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; -- job 38:25
.
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; -- job 38:26
.
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? -- job 38:27
.
Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? -- job 38:28
.
Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? -- job 38:29
.
The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. -- job 38:30
.
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? -- job 38:31
.
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? -- job 38:32
.
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? -- job 38:33
.
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? -- job 38:34
.
Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are? -- job 38:35
.
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? -- job 38:36
.
Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, -- job 38:37
.
When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? -- job 38:38
.
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, -- job 38:39
.
When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? -- job 38:40
.
Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. -- job 38:41
.
Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? -- job 39:1
.
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? -- job 39:2
.
They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. -- job 39:3
.
Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. -- job 39:4
.
Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? -- job 39:5
.
Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. -- job 39:6
.
He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. -- job 39:7
.
The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. -- job 39:8
.
Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? -- job 39:9
.
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? -- job 39:10
.
Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? -- job 39:11
.
Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? -- job 39:12
.
Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? -- job 39:13
.
Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, -- job 39:14
.
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. -- job 39:15
.
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear; -- job 39:16
.
Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. -- job 39:17
.
What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. -- job 39:18
.
Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? -- job 39:19
.
Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. -- job 39:20
.
He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. -- job 39:21
.
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. -- job 39:22
.
The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. -- job 39:23
.
He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. -- job 39:24
.
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. -- job 39:25
.
Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? -- job 39:26
.
Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? -- job 39:27
.
She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. -- job 39:28
.
From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. -- job 39:29
.
Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she. -- job 39:30
.
Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, -- job 40:1
.
Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. -- job 40:2
.
Then Job answered the LORD, and said, -- job 40:3
.
Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. -- job 40:4
.
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. -- job 40:5
.
Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, -- job 40:6
.
Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. -- job 40:7
.
Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? -- job 40:8
.
Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? -- job 40:9
.
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. -- job 40:10
.
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. -- job 40:11
.
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. -- job 40:12
.
Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. -- job 40:13
.
Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. -- job 40:14
.
Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. -- job 40:15
.
Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. -- job 40:16
.
He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. -- job 40:17
.
His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. -- job 40:18
.
He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. -- job 40:19
.
Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. -- job 40:20
.
He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. -- job 40:21
.
The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. -- job 40:22
.
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. -- job 40:23
.
He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares. -- job 40:24
.
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? -- job 41:1
.
Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? -- job 41:2
.
Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? -- job 41:3
.
Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? -- job 41:4
.
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? -- job 41:5
.
Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? -- job 41:6
.
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? -- job 41:7
.
Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. -- job 41:8
.
Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? -- job 41:9
.
None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? -- job 41:10
.
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. -- job 41:11
.
I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. -- job 41:12
.
Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? -- job 41:13
.
Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. -- job 41:14
.
His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. -- job 41:15
.
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. -- job 41:16
.
They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. -- job 41:17
.
By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. -- job 41:18
.
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. -- job 41:19
.
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. -- job 41:20
.
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. -- job 41:21
.
In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. -- job 41:22
.
The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. -- job 41:23
.
His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. -- job 41:24
.
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. -- job 41:25
.
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. -- job 41:26
.
He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. -- job 41:27
.
The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. -- job 41:28
.
Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. -- job 41:29
.
Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. -- job 41:30
.
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. -- job 41:31
.
He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. -- job 41:32
.
Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. -- job 41:33
.
He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride. -- job 41:34
.
Then Job answered the LORD, and said, -- job 42:1
.
I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee. -- job 42:2
.
Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. -- job 42:3
.
Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. -- job 42:4
.
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. -- job 42:5
.
Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. -- job 42:6
.
And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. -- job 42:7
.
Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job. -- job 42:8
.
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job. -- job 42:9
.
And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. -- job 42:10
.
Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold. -- job 42:11
.
So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. -- job 42:12
.
He had also seven sons and three daughters. -- job 42:13
.
And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch. -- job 42:14
.
And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. -- job 42:15
.
After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. -- job 42:16
.
So Job died, being old and full of days. -- job 42:17
.
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. -- psalms 1:1
.
But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. -- psalms 1:2
.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. -- psalms 1:3
.
The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. -- psalms 1:4
.
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. -- psalms 1:5
.
For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. -- psalms 1:6
.
Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? -- psalms 2:1
.
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, -- psalms 2:2
.
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. -- psalms 2:3
.
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision. -- psalms 2:4
.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. -- psalms 2:5
.
Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. -- psalms 2:6
.
I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. -- psalms 2:7
.
Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. -- psalms 2:8
.
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. -- psalms 2:9
.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. -- psalms 2:10
.
Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. -- psalms 2:11
.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. -- psalms 2:12
.
Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me. -- psalms 3:1
.
Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. -- psalms 3:2
.
But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. -- psalms 3:3
.
I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. -- psalms 3:4
.
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. -- psalms 3:5
.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about. -- psalms 3:6
.
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. -- psalms 3:7
.
Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah. -- psalms 3:8
.
Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. -- psalms 4:1
.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah. -- psalms 4:2
.
But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. -- psalms 4:3
.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. -- psalms 4:4
.
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. -- psalms 4:5
.
There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. -- psalms 4:6
.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased. -- psalms 4:7
.
I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety. -- psalms 4:8
.
Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. -- psalms 5:1
.
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. -- psalms 5:2
.
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up. -- psalms 5:3
.
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. -- psalms 5:4
.
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. -- psalms 5:5
.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. -- psalms 5:6
.
But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. -- psalms 5:7
.
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. -- psalms 5:8
.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. -- psalms 5:9
.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. -- psalms 5:10
.
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. -- psalms 5:11
.
For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield. -- psalms 5:12
.

.
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. -- psalms 7:2
.
O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; -- psalms 7:3
.
If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) -- psalms 7:4
.
Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. -- psalms 7:5
.
Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. -- psalms 7:6

.
God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. -- psalms 7:11

.
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. -- psalms 7:13
.
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. -- psalms 7:14
.
He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. -- psalms 7:15
.
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. -- psalms 7:16

.
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. -- psalms 10:8

.
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. -- psalms 10:12
.
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. -- psalms 10:13
.

To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. -- psalms 10:18

They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. -- psalms 73:8
.
They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. -- psalms 73:9
.
Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. -- psalms 73:10
.
And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? -- psalms 73:11
.
Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches. -- psalms 73:12
.
Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. -- psalms 73:13
.
For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. -- psalms 73:14
.
If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. -- psalms 73:15
.
When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; -- psalms 73:16
.
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. -- psalms 73:17
.
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. -- psalms 73:18
.
How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. -- psalms 73:19
.
As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. -- psalms 73:20
.
Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. -- psalms 73:21
.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. -- psalms 73:22
.
Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. -- psalms 73:23
.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. -- psalms 73:24
.
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. -- psalms 73:25
.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. -- psalms 73:26
.
For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. -- psalms 73:27
.
But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works. -- psalms 73:28
.
O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? -- psalms 74:1
.
Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. -- psalms 74:2
.
Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. -- psalms 74:3
.
Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. -- psalms 74:4
.
A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. -- psalms 74:5
.
But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. -- psalms 74:6
.
They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. -- psalms 74:7
.
They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. -- psalms 74:8
.
We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. -- psalms 74:9
.
O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? -- psalms 74:10
.
Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom. -- psalms 74:11
.
For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. -- psalms 74:12
.
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. -- psalms 74:13
.
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. -- psalms 74:14
.
Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. -- psalms 74:15
.
The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. -- psalms 74:16
.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. -- psalms 74:17
.
Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. -- psalms 74:18
.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. -- psalms 74:19
.
Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. -- psalms 74:20
.
O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. -- psalms 74:21
.
Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. -- psalms 74:22
.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually. -- psalms 74:23
.
Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. -- psalms 75:1
.
When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. -- psalms 75:2
.
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. -- psalms 75:3
.
I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: -- psalms 75:4
.
Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. -- psalms 75:5
.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. -- psalms 75:6
.
But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. -- psalms 75:7
.
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. -- psalms 75:8
.
But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. -- psalms 75:9
.
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. -- psalms 75:10
.
In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. -- psalms 76:1
.
In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. -- psalms 76:2
.
There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. -- psalms 76:3
.
Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. -- psalms 76:4
.
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. -- psalms 76:5
.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. -- psalms 76:6
.
Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? -- psalms 76:7
.
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, -- psalms 76:8
.
When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. -- psalms 76:9
.
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. -- psalms 76:10
.
Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. -- psalms 76:11
.
He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth. -- psalms 76:12
.
I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. -- psalms 77:1
.
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. -- psalms 77:2
.
I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. -- psalms 77:3
.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. -- psalms 77:4
.
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. -- psalms 77:5
.
I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. -- psalms 77:6
.
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? -- psalms 77:7
.
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? -- psalms 77:8
.
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. -- psalms 77:9
.
And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. -- psalms 77:10
.
I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. -- psalms 77:11
.
I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. -- psalms 77:12
.
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? -- psalms 77:13
.
Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. -- psalms 77:14
.
Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. -- psalms 77:15
.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. -- psalms 77:16
.
The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. -- psalms 77:17
.
The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. -- psalms 77:18
.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. -- psalms 77:19
.
Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. -- psalms 77:20
.
Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. -- psalms 78:1
.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: -- psalms 78:2
.
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. -- psalms 78:3
.
We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. -- psalms 78:4
.
For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: -- psalms 78:5
.
That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: -- psalms 78:6
.
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: -- psalms 78:7
.
And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. -- psalms 78:8
.
The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. -- psalms 78:9
.
They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; -- psalms 78:10
.
And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. -- psalms 78:11
.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. -- psalms 78:12
.
He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. -- psalms 78:13
.
In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. -- psalms 78:14
.
He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. -- psalms 78:15
.
He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. -- psalms 78:16
.
And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. -- psalms 78:17
.
And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. -- psalms 78:18
.
Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? -- psalms 78:19
.
Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? -- psalms 78:20
.
Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; -- psalms 78:21
.
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: -- psalms 78:22
.
Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, -- psalms 78:23
.
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. -- psalms 78:24
.
Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. -- psalms 78:25
.
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. -- psalms 78:26
.
He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: -- psalms 78:27
.
And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. -- psalms 78:28
.
So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; -- psalms 78:29
.
They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, -- psalms 78:30
.
The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. -- psalms 78:31
.
For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. -- psalms 78:32
.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. -- psalms 78:33
.
When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. -- psalms 78:34
.
And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. -- psalms 78:35
.
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. -- psalms 78:36
.
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. -- psalms 78:37
.
But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. -- psalms 78:38
.
For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. -- psalms 78:39
.
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! -- psalms 78:40
.
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. -- psalms 78:41
.
They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. -- psalms 78:42
.
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan. -- psalms 78:43
.
And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. -- psalms 78:44
.
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. -- psalms 78:45
.
He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. -- psalms 78:46
.
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. -- psalms 78:47
.
He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. -- psalms 78:48
.
He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. -- psalms 78:49
.
He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; -- psalms 78:50
.
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: -- psalms 78:51
.
But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. -- psalms 78:52
.
And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. -- psalms 78:53
.
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. -- psalms 78:54
.
He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. -- psalms 78:55
.
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: -- psalms 78:56
.
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. -- psalms 78:57
.
For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. -- psalms 78:58
.
When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: -- psalms 78:59
.
So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; -- psalms 78:60
.
And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. -- psalms 78:61
.
He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. -- psalms 78:62
.
The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. -- psalms 78:63
.
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. -- psalms 78:64
.
Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. -- psalms 78:65
.
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. -- psalms 78:66
.
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: -- psalms 78:67
.
But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. -- psalms 78:68
.
And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. -- psalms 78:69
.
He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: -- psalms 78:70
.
From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. -- psalms 78:71
.
So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. -- psalms 78:72
.
O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. -- psalms 79:1
.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. -- psalms 79:2
.
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. -- psalms 79:3
.
We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. -- psalms 79:4
.
How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? -- psalms 79:5
.
Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. -- psalms 79:6
.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place. -- psalms 79:7
.
O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. -- psalms 79:8
.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. -- psalms 79:9
.
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed. -- psalms 79:10
.
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; -- psalms 79:11
.
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. -- psalms 79:12
.
So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations. -- psalms 79:13
.
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. -- psalms 80:1
.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. -- psalms 80:2
.
Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. -- psalms 80:3
.
O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? -- psalms 80:4
.
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. -- psalms 80:5
.
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. -- psalms 80:6
.
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. -- psalms 80:7
.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. -- psalms 80:8
.
Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. -- psalms 80:9
.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. -- psalms 80:10
.
She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. -- psalms 80:11
.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? -- psalms 80:12
.
The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. -- psalms 80:13
.
Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; -- psalms 80:14
.
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. -- psalms 80:15
.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. -- psalms 80:16
.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. -- psalms 80:17
.
So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. -- psalms 80:18
.
Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. -- psalms 80:19
.
Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. -- psalms 81:1
.
Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. -- psalms 81:2
.
Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. -- psalms 81:3
.
For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. -- psalms 81:4
.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not. -- psalms 81:5
.
I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. -- psalms 81:6
.
Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. -- psalms 81:7
.
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; -- psalms 81:8
.
There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. -- psalms 81:9
.
I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. -- psalms 81:10
.
But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. -- psalms 81:11
.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels. -- psalms 81:12
.
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! -- psalms 81:13
.
I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. -- psalms 81:14
.
The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. -- psalms 81:15
.
He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. -- psalms 81:16
.
God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. -- psalms 82:1
.
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. -- psalms 82:2
.
Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. -- psalms 82:3
.
Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. -- psalms 82:4
.
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. -- psalms 82:5
.
I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. -- psalms 82:6
.
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. -- psalms 82:7
.
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations. -- psalms 82:8
.
Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. -- psalms 83:1
.
For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. -- psalms 83:2
.
They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. -- psalms 83:3
.
They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. -- psalms 83:4
.
For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: -- psalms 83:5
.
The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; -- psalms 83:6
.
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; -- psalms 83:7
.
Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. -- psalms 83:8
.
Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: -- psalms 83:9
.
Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. -- psalms 83:10
.
Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: -- psalms 83:11
.
Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. -- psalms 83:12
.
O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. -- psalms 83:13
.
As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; -- psalms 83:14
.
So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. -- psalms 83:15
.
Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. -- psalms 83:16
.
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: -- psalms 83:17
.
That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. -- psalms 83:18
.
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! -- psalms 84:1
.
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. -- psalms 84:2
.
Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. -- psalms 84:3
.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. -- psalms 84:4
.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. -- psalms 84:5
.

I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. -- psalms 102:7

Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. -- psalms 102:10

He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. -- psalms 105:8
.
Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; -- psalms 105:9
.
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: -- psalms 105:10
.
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: -- psalms 105:11
.
When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. -- psalms 105:12
.
When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; -- psalms 105:13

.
Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. -- psalms 105:15
.
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. -- psalms 105:16
.
He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: -- psalms 105:17
.
Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: -- psalms 105:18
.
Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. -- psalms 105:19
.
The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. -- psalms 105:20
.
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: -- psalms 105:21
.
To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. -- psalms 105:22
.
Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. -- psalms 105:23
.

He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. -- psalms 105:31
.
He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. -- psalms 105:32
.
He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. -- psalms 105:33
.
He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, -- psalms 105:34
.
And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. -- psalms 105:35
.
He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. -- psalms 105:36
.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. -- psalms 105:37
.
Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. -- psalms 105:38
.
He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. -- psalms 105:39
.
The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. -- psalms 105:40
.
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. -- psalms 105:41
.
For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. -- psalms 105:42
.
And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: -- psalms 105:43
.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; -- psalms 105:44
.
That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. -- psalms 105:45

.
That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. -- psalms 106:5
.
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. -- psalms 106:6
.
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. -- psalms 106:7
.
Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. -- psalms 106:8
.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. -- psalms 106:9
.
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. -- psalms 106:10
.
And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. -- psalms 106:11
.
Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. -- psalms 106:12
.
They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: -- psalms 106:13
.
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. -- psalms 106:14
.
And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. -- psalms 106:15
.
They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. -- psalms 106:16
.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram. -- psalms 106:17
.
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. -- psalms 106:18
.
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. -- psalms 106:19
.
Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. -- psalms 106:20
.
They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; -- psalms 106:21
.
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. -- psalms 106:22
.
Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. -- psalms 106:23
.
Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: -- psalms 106:24
.
But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. -- psalms 106:25
.
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: -- psalms 106:26
.
To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. -- psalms 106:27
.
They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. -- psalms 106:28
.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. -- psalms 106:29
.
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. -- psalms 106:30
.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. -- psalms 106:31
.
They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: -- psalms 106:32
.
Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. -- psalms 106:33
.
They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: -- psalms 106:34
.
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. -- psalms 106:35
.
And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. -- psalms 106:36
.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, -- psalms 106:37
.
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. -- psalms 106:38
.
Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. -- psalms 106:39
.
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. -- psalms 106:40
.
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. -- psalms 106:41
.
Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. -- psalms 106:42
.
Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. -- psalms 106:43
.
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: -- psalms 106:44
.
And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. -- psalms 106:45
.
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. -- psalms 106:46
.
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. -- psalms 106:47
.
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. -- psalms 106:48
.
O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. -- psalms 107:1
.
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; -- psalms 107:2
.
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. -- psalms 107:3
.
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. -- psalms 107:4
.
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. -- psalms 107:5
.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:6
.
And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. -- psalms 107:7
.
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- psalms 107:8
.
For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. -- psalms 107:9
.
Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; -- psalms 107:10
.
Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: -- psalms 107:11
.
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. -- psalms 107:12
.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:13
.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. -- psalms 107:14
.
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- psalms 107:15
.
For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. -- psalms 107:16
.
Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. -- psalms 107:17
.
Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. -- psalms 107:18
.
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:19
.
He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. -- psalms 107:20
.
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- psalms 107:21
.
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. -- psalms 107:22
.
They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; -- psalms 107:23
.
These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. -- psalms 107:24
.
For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. -- psalms 107:25
.
They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. -- psalms 107:26
.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. -- psalms 107:27
.
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:28
.
He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. -- psalms 107:29
.
Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. -- psalms 107:30
.
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- psalms 107:31
.
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. -- psalms 107:32
.
He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; -- psalms 107:33
.
A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. -- psalms 107:34
.
He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. -- psalms 107:35
.
And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; -- psalms 107:36
.
And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. -- psalms 107:37
.
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. -- psalms 107:38
.
Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. -- psalms 107:39
.
He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. -- psalms 107:40
.
Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. -- psalms 107:41
.
The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. -- psalms 107:42
.
Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. -- psalms 107:43
.
O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. -- psalms 108:1
.

.
The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 1:9
.
Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. -- ecclesiastes 1:10
.
There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. -- ecclesiastes 1:11
.
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 1:12
.
And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. -- ecclesiastes 1:13
.
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 1:14
.
That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. -- ecclesiastes 1:15
.
I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. -- ecclesiastes 1:16
.
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 1:17
.
For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. -- ecclesiastes 1:18
.
I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:1
.
I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? -- ecclesiastes 2:2
.
I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. -- ecclesiastes 2:3
.
I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: -- ecclesiastes 2:4
.
I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: -- ecclesiastes 2:5
.
I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: -- ecclesiastes 2:6
.
I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: -- ecclesiastes 2:7
.
I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. -- ecclesiastes 2:8
.
So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. -- ecclesiastes 2:9
.
And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. -- ecclesiastes 2:10
.
Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 2:11
.
And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done. -- ecclesiastes 2:12
.
Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. -- ecclesiastes 2:13
.
The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. -- ecclesiastes 2:14
.
Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:15
.
For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool. -- ecclesiastes 2:16
.
Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 2:17
.

.
And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:19
.
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 2:20
.
For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. -- ecclesiastes 2:21
.
For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 2:22
.
For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:23
.
There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. -- ecclesiastes 2:24
.
For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? -- ecclesiastes 2:25
.
For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 2:26
.
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: -- ecclesiastes 3:1
.
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; -- ecclesiastes 3:2
.
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; -- ecclesiastes 3:3
.
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; -- ecclesiastes 3:4
.

.
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. -- ecclesiastes 3:8
.
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? -- ecclesiastes 3:9
.
I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. -- ecclesiastes 3:10
.
He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. -- ecclesiastes 3:11
.
I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. -- ecclesiastes 3:12
.
And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God. -- ecclesiastes 3:13
.
I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. -- ecclesiastes 3:14
.
That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. -- ecclesiastes 3:15
.
And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there. -- ecclesiastes 3:16
.
I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. -- ecclesiastes 3:17
.
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. -- ecclesiastes 3:18
.
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 3:19
.
All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. -- ecclesiastes 3:20
.
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? -- ecclesiastes 3:21
.
Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? -- ecclesiastes 3:22
.
So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. -- ecclesiastes 4:1
.
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. -- ecclesiastes 4:2
.
Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 4:3
.
Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 4:4
.
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. -- ecclesiastes 4:5
.
Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 4:6
.
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 4:7
.
There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. -- ecclesiastes 4:8
.
Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. -- ecclesiastes 4:9
.
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. -- ecclesiastes 4:10
.
Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? -- ecclesiastes 4:11
.
And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. -- ecclesiastes 4:12
.
Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. -- ecclesiastes 4:13
.
For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor. -- ecclesiastes 4:14
.
I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. -- ecclesiastes 4:15
.
There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 4:16
.
Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. -- ecclesiastes 5:1
.
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. -- ecclesiastes 5:2
.
For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words. -- ecclesiastes 5:3
.
When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. -- ecclesiastes 5:4
.
Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. -- ecclesiastes 5:5
.
Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? -- ecclesiastes 5:6
.
For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God. -- ecclesiastes 5:7
.
If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they. -- ecclesiastes 5:8
.
Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field. -- ecclesiastes 5:9
.
He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. -- ecclesiastes 5:10
.
When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? -- ecclesiastes 5:11
.
The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. -- ecclesiastes 5:12
.
There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. -- ecclesiastes 5:13
.
But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand. -- ecclesiastes 5:14
.
As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. -- ecclesiastes 5:15
.
And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? -- ecclesiastes 5:16
.
All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. -- ecclesiastes 5:17
.
Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion. -- ecclesiastes 5:18
.
Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God. -- ecclesiastes 5:19
.
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart. -- ecclesiastes 5:20
.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: -- ecclesiastes 6:1
.
A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. -- ecclesiastes 6:2
.
If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he. -- ecclesiastes 6:3
.
For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness. -- ecclesiastes 6:4
.
Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other. -- ecclesiastes 6:5
.
Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? -- ecclesiastes 6:6
.
All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. -- ecclesiastes 6:7
.
For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? -- ecclesiastes 6:8
.
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 6:9
.
That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he. -- ecclesiastes 6:10
.
Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better? -- ecclesiastes 6:11
.
For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 6:12
.
A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. -- ecclesiastes 7:1
.
It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. -- ecclesiastes 7:2
.
Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. -- ecclesiastes 7:3
.
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. -- ecclesiastes 7:4
.
It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. -- ecclesiastes 7:5
.
For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 7:6
.
Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. -- ecclesiastes 7:7
.
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. -- ecclesiastes 7:8
.
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. -- ecclesiastes 7:9
.
Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. -- ecclesiastes 7:10
.
Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun. -- ecclesiastes 7:11
.
For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. -- ecclesiastes 7:12
.
Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? -- ecclesiastes 7:13
.
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. -- ecclesiastes 7:14
.
All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. -- ecclesiastes 7:15
.
Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ? -- ecclesiastes 7:16
.
Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? -- ecclesiastes 7:17
.
It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. -- ecclesiastes 7:18
.
Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. -- ecclesiastes 7:19
.
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. -- ecclesiastes 7:20
.
Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: -- ecclesiastes 7:21
.
For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. -- ecclesiastes 7:22
.
All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. -- ecclesiastes 7:23
.
That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? -- ecclesiastes 7:24
.
I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness: -- ecclesiastes 7:25
.
And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. -- ecclesiastes 7:26
.
Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account: -- ecclesiastes 7:27
.
Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. -- ecclesiastes 7:28
.
Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. -- ecclesiastes 7:29
.
Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed. -- ecclesiastes 8:1
.
I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. -- ecclesiastes 8:2
.
Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. -- ecclesiastes 8:3
.
Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? -- ecclesiastes 8:4
.
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. -- ecclesiastes 8:5
.
Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him. -- ecclesiastes 8:6
.
For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? -- ecclesiastes 8:7
.
There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it. -- ecclesiastes 8:8
.
All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. -- ecclesiastes 8:9
.
And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity. -- ecclesiastes 8:10
.
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. -- ecclesiastes 8:11
.
Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: -- ecclesiastes 8:12
.
But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. -- ecclesiastes 8:13
.
There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 8:14
.
Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 8:15
.
When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) -- ecclesiastes 8:16
.
Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it. -- ecclesiastes 8:17
.
For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. -- ecclesiastes 9:1
.
All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. -- ecclesiastes 9:2
.
This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. -- ecclesiastes 9:3
.
For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. -- ecclesiastes 9:4
.
For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. -- ecclesiastes 9:5
.
Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 9:6
.
Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. -- ecclesiastes 9:7
.
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment. -- ecclesiastes 9:8
.
Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 9:9
.
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. -- ecclesiastes 9:10
.
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. -- ecclesiastes 9:11
.
For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. -- ecclesiastes 9:12
.
This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me: -- ecclesiastes 9:13
.
There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: -- ecclesiastes 9:14
.
Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. -- ecclesiastes 9:15
.
Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard. -- ecclesiastes 9:16
.
The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. -- ecclesiastes 9:17
.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good. -- ecclesiastes 9:18
.
Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. -- ecclesiastes 10:1
.
A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. -- ecclesiastes 10:2
.
Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. -- ecclesiastes 10:3
.
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. -- ecclesiastes 10:4
.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: -- ecclesiastes 10:5
.
Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. -- ecclesiastes 10:6
.
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. -- ecclesiastes 10:7
.
He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. -- ecclesiastes 10:8
.
Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. -- ecclesiastes 10:9
.
If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. -- ecclesiastes 10:10
.
Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. -- ecclesiastes 10:11
.
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. -- ecclesiastes 10:12
.
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. -- ecclesiastes 10:13
.
A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? -- ecclesiastes 10:14
.
The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. -- ecclesiastes 10:15
.
Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! -- ecclesiastes 10:16
.
Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! -- ecclesiastes 10:17
.
By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. -- ecclesiastes 10:18
.
A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things. -- ecclesiastes 10:19
.
Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. -- ecclesiastes 10:20
.
Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. -- ecclesiastes 11:1
.
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. -- ecclesiastes 11:2
.
If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. -- ecclesiastes 11:3
.
He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. -- ecclesiastes 11:4
.
As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. -- ecclesiastes 11:5
.
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. -- ecclesiastes 11:6
.
Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: -- ecclesiastes 11:7
.
But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 11:8
.
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. -- ecclesiastes 11:9
.
Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. -- ecclesiastes 11:10
.
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; -- ecclesiastes 12:1
.
While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: -- ecclesiastes 12:2
.
In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, -- ecclesiastes 12:3
.
And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; -- ecclesiastes 12:4
.
Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: -- ecclesiastes 12:5
.
Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. -- ecclesiastes 12:6
.
Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. -- ecclesiastes 12:7
.
Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 12:8
.
And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. -- ecclesiastes 12:9
.
The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth. -- ecclesiastes 12:10
.
The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. -- ecclesiastes 12:11
.
And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. -- ecclesiastes 12:12
.
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. -- ecclesiastes 12:13
.
For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. -- ecclesiastes 12:14
.

.
As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. -- song of solomon 2:2
.
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. -- song of solomon 2:3
.

.

.
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. -- song of solomon 2:9

The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; -- song of solomon 2:12
.
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. -- song of solomon 2:13
.
O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. -- song of solomon 2:14
.
Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. -- song of solomon 2:15
.
My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies. -- song of solomon 2:16
.
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. -- song of solomon 2:17

.
Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: -- song of solomon 4:14

Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. -- song of solomon 6:12
.
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. -- song of solomon 6:13
.
How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. -- song of solomon 7:1
.
Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies. -- song of solomon 7:2
.
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins. -- song of solomon 7:3
.
Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. -- song of solomon 7:4
.
Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. -- song of solomon 7:5
.
How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! -- song of solomon 7:6
.
This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. -- song of solomon 7:7
.
I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; -- song of solomon 7:8
.
And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak. -- song of solomon 7:9
.
I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me. -- song of solomon 7:10
.
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. -- song of solomon 7:11
.
Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves. -- song of solomon 7:12
.
The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved. -- song of solomon 7:13
.
O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised. -- song of solomon 8:1
.
I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. -- song of solomon 8:2
.
His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me. -- song of solomon 8:3
.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please. -- song of solomon 8:4
.
Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee. -- song of solomon 8:5
.
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. -- song of solomon 8:6
.
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned. -- song of solomon 8:7
.
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? -- song of solomon 8:8
.
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. -- song of solomon 8:9
.
I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. -- song of solomon 8:10
.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver. -- song of solomon 8:11
.
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. -- song of solomon 8:12
.
Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it. -- song of solomon 8:13
.
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices. -- song of solomon 8:14
.
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. -- daniel 1:1
.
And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. -- daniel 1:2
.
And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; -- daniel 1:3
.
Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. -- daniel 1:4
.
And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. -- daniel 1:5
.
Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: -- daniel 1:6
.
Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. -- daniel 1:7
.
But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. -- daniel 1:8
.
Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. -- daniel 1:9
.
And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. -- daniel 1:10
.
Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, -- daniel 1:11
.
Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. -- daniel 1:12
.
Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. -- daniel 1:13
.
So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. -- daniel 1:14
.
And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. -- daniel 1:15
.
Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. -- daniel 1:16
.
As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. -- daniel 1:17
.
Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. -- daniel 1:18
.
And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. -- daniel 1:19
.
And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. -- daniel 1:20
.
And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus. -- daniel 1:21
.
And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. -- daniel 2:1
.
Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. -- daniel 2:2
.
And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. -- daniel 2:3
.
Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. -- daniel 2:4
.
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. -- daniel 2:5
.
But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. -- daniel 2:6
.
They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. -- daniel 2:7
.
The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. -- daniel 2:8
.
But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. -- daniel 2:9
.
The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. -- daniel 2:10
.
And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. -- daniel 2:11
.
For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:12
.
And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. -- daniel 2:13
.
Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: -- daniel 2:14
.
He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. -- daniel 2:15
.
Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. -- daniel 2:16
.
Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: -- daniel 2:17
.
That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:18
.
Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. -- daniel 2:19
.
Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: -- daniel 2:20
.
And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: -- daniel 2:21
.
He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. -- daniel 2:22
.
I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter. -- daniel 2:23
.
Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation. -- daniel 2:24
.
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. -- daniel 2:25
.
The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? -- daniel 2:26
.
Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; -- daniel 2:27
.
But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; -- daniel 2:28
.
As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. -- daniel 2:29
.
But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart. -- daniel 2:30
.
Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. -- daniel 2:31
.
This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, -- daniel 2:32
.
His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. -- daniel 2:33
.
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. -- daniel 2:34
.
Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. -- daniel 2:35
.
This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. -- daniel 2:36
.
Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. -- daniel 2:37
.
And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. -- daniel 2:38
.
And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. -- daniel 2:39
.
And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. -- daniel 2:40
.
And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. -- daniel 2:41
.
And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. -- daniel 2:42
.
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. -- daniel 2:43
.
And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. -- daniel 2:44
.
Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. -- daniel 2:45
.
Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him. -- daniel 2:46
.
The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret. -- daniel 2:47
.
Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:48
.
Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king. -- daniel 2:49
.
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. -- daniel 3:1
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. -- daniel 3:2
.
Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. -- daniel 3:3
.
Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, -- daniel 3:4
.
That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: -- daniel 3:5
.
And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:6
.
Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. -- daniel 3:7
.
Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews. -- daniel 3:8
.
They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever. -- daniel 3:9
.
Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image: -- daniel 3:10
.
And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:11
.
There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. -- daniel 3:12
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king. -- daniel 3:13
.
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? -- daniel 3:14
.
Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? -- daniel 3:15
.
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. -- daniel 3:16
.
If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. -- daniel 3:17
.
But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. -- daniel 3:18
.
Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated. -- daniel 3:19
.
And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:20
.
Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:21
.
Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. -- daniel 3:22
.
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. -- daniel 3:23
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. -- daniel 3:24
.
He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. -- daniel 3:25
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire. -- daniel 3:26
.
And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them. -- daniel 3:27
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. -- daniel 3:28
.
Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort. -- daniel 3:29
.
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon. -- daniel 3:30
.
Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. -- daniel 4:1
.
I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. -- daniel 4:2
.
How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. -- daniel 4:3
.
I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace: -- daniel 4:4
.
I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. -- daniel 4:5
.
Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. -- daniel 4:6
.
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. -- daniel 4:7
.
But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, -- daniel 4:8
.
O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. -- daniel 4:9
.
Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. -- daniel 4:10
.
The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: -- daniel 4:11
.
The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. -- daniel 4:12
.
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; -- daniel 4:13
.
He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches: -- daniel 4:14
.
Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: -- daniel 4:15
.
Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. -- daniel 4:16
.
This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men. -- daniel 4:17
.
This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. -- daniel 4:18
.
Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies. -- daniel 4:19
.
The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; -- daniel 4:20
.
Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: -- daniel 4:21
.
It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. -- daniel 4:22
.
And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; -- daniel 4:23
.
This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king: -- daniel 4:24
.
That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. -- daniel 4:25
.
And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. -- daniel 4:26
.
Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. -- daniel 4:27
.
All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. -- daniel 4:28
.
At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. -- daniel 4:29
.
The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty? -- daniel 4:30
.
While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. -- daniel 4:31
.
And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. -- daniel 4:32
.
The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws. -- daniel 4:33
.
And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation: -- daniel 4:34
.
And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? -- daniel 4:35
.
At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. -- daniel 4:36
.
Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. -- daniel 4:37
.
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. -- daniel 5:1
.
Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. -- daniel 5:2
.
Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. -- daniel 5:3
.
They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. -- daniel 5:4
.
In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. -- daniel 5:5
.
Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. -- daniel 5:6
.
The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. -- daniel 5:7
.
Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. -- daniel 5:8
.
Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied. -- daniel 5:9
.
Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed: -- daniel 5:10
.
There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; -- daniel 5:11
.
Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation. -- daniel 5:12
.
Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry? -- daniel 5:13
.
I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee. -- daniel 5:14
.
And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing: -- daniel 5:15
.
And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. -- daniel 5:16
.
Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. -- daniel 5:17
.
O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: -- daniel 5:18
.
And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down. -- daniel 5:19
.
But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: -- daniel 5:20
.
And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. -- daniel 5:21
.
And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this; -- daniel 5:22
.
But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified: -- daniel 5:23
.
Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written. -- daniel 5:24
.
And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. -- daniel 5:25
.
This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. -- daniel 5:26
.
TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. -- daniel 5:27
.
PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. -- daniel 5:28
.
Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. -- daniel 5:29
.
In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. -- daniel 5:30
.
And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old. -- daniel 5:31
.
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; -- daniel 6:1
.
And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage. -- daniel 6:2
.
Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. -- daniel 6:3
.
Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. -- daniel 6:4
.
Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God. -- daniel 6:5
.
Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. -- daniel 6:6
.
All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. -- daniel 6:7
.
Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. -- daniel 6:8
.
Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree. -- daniel 6:9
.
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. -- daniel 6:10
.
Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. -- daniel 6:11
.
Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. -- daniel 6:12
.
Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. -- daniel 6:13
.
Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. -- daniel 6:14
.
Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. -- daniel 6:15
.
Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. -- daniel 6:16
.
And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. -- daniel 6:17
.
Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him. -- daniel 6:18
.
Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. -- daniel 6:19
.
And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? -- daniel 6:20
.
Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. -- daniel 6:21
.
My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. -- daniel 6:22
.
Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. -- daniel 6:23
.
And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. -- daniel 6:24
.
Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. -- daniel 6:25
.
I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. -- daniel 6:26
.
He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. -- daniel 6:27
.
So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. -- daniel 6:28
.
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. -- daniel 7:1
.
Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. -- daniel 7:2
.
And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. -- daniel 7:3
.
The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. -- daniel 7:4
.
And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. -- daniel 7:5
.
After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. -- daniel 7:6
.
After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. -- daniel 7:7
.
I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. -- daniel 7:8
.
I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. -- daniel 7:9
.
A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. -- daniel 7:10
.
I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. -- daniel 7:11
.
As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. -- daniel 7:12
.
I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. -- daniel 7:13
.
And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. -- daniel 7:14
.
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. -- daniel 7:15
.
I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. -- daniel 7:16
.
These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. -- daniel 7:17
.
But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. -- daniel 7:18
.
Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; -- daniel 7:19
.
And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. -- daniel 7:20
.
I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; -- daniel 7:21
.
Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. -- daniel 7:22
.
Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. -- daniel 7:23
.
And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. -- daniel 7:24
.
And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. -- daniel 7:25
.
But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. -- daniel 7:26
.
And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. -- daniel 7:27
.
Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart. -- daniel 7:28
.
In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. -- daniel 8:1
.
And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. -- daniel 8:2
.
Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. -- daniel 8:3
.
I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great. -- daniel 8:4
.
And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. -- daniel 8:5
.
And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. -- daniel 8:6
.
And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. -- daniel 8:7
.
Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. -- daniel 8:8
.
And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. -- daniel 8:9
.
And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. -- daniel 8:10
.
Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down. -- daniel 8:11
.
And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. -- daniel 8:12
.
Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? -- daniel 8:13
.
And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. -- daniel 8:14
.
And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. -- daniel 8:15
.
And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. -- daniel 8:16
.
So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision. -- daniel 8:17
.
Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. -- daniel 8:18
.
And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be. -- daniel 8:19
.
The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. -- daniel 8:20
.
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. -- daniel 8:21
.
Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. -- daniel 8:22
.
And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. -- daniel 8:23
.
And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. -- daniel 8:24
.
And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. -- daniel 8:25
.
And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days. -- daniel 8:26
.
And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it. -- daniel 8:27
.
In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; -- daniel 9:1
.
In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. -- daniel 9:2
.
And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: -- daniel 9:3
.
And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; -- daniel 9:4
.
We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: -- daniel 9:5
.
Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. -- daniel 9:6
.
O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. -- daniel 9:7
.
O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. -- daniel 9:8
.
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him; -- daniel 9:9
.
Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. -- daniel 9:10
.
Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. -- daniel 9:11
.
And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. -- daniel 9:12
.
As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth. -- daniel 9:13
.
Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice. -- daniel 9:14
.
And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. -- daniel 9:15
.
O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. -- daniel 9:16
.
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. -- daniel 9:17
.
O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. -- daniel 9:18
.
O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name. -- daniel 9:19
.
And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God; -- daniel 9:20
.
Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. -- daniel 9:21
.
And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding. -- daniel 9:22
.
At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. -- daniel 9:23
.
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. -- daniel 9:24
.
Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. -- daniel 9:25
.
And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. -- daniel 9:26
.
And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate. -- daniel 9:27
.
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision. -- daniel 10:1
.
In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. -- daniel 10:2
.
I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. -- daniel 10:3
.
And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel; -- daniel 10:4
.
Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: -- daniel 10:5
.
His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. -- daniel 10:6
.
And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. -- daniel 10:7
.
Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. -- daniel 10:8
.
Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground. -- daniel 10:9
.
And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. -- daniel 10:10
.
And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. -- daniel 10:11
.
Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. -- daniel 10:12
.
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. -- daniel 10:13
.
Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days. -- daniel 10:14
.
And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb. -- daniel 10:15
.
And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. -- daniel 10:16
.
For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. -- daniel 10:17
.
Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me, -- daniel 10:18
.
And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. -- daniel 10:19
.
Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. -- daniel 10:20
.
But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince. -- daniel 10:21
.
Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him. -- daniel 11:1
.
And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. -- daniel 11:2
.
And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. -- daniel 11:3
.
And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those. -- daniel 11:4
.
And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion. -- daniel 11:5
.
And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times. -- daniel 11:6
.
But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail: -- daniel 11:7
.
And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north. -- daniel 11:8
.
So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land. -- daniel 11:9
.
But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress. -- daniel 11:10
.
And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand. -- daniel 11:11
.
And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it. -- daniel 11:12
.
For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches. -- daniel 11:13
.
And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall. -- daniel 11:14
.
So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand. -- daniel 11:15
.
But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed. -- daniel 11:16
.
He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him. -- daniel 11:17
.
After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him. -- daniel 11:18
.
Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found. -- daniel 11:19
.
Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle. -- daniel 11:20
.
And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. -- daniel 11:21
.
And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. -- daniel 11:22
.
And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people. -- daniel 11:23
.
He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time. -- daniel 11:24
.
And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him. -- daniel 11:25
.
Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain. -- daniel 11:26
.
And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed. -- daniel 11:27
.
Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land. -- daniel 11:28
.
At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter. -- daniel 11:29
.
For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant. -- daniel 11:30
.
And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate. -- daniel 11:31
.
And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits. -- daniel 11:32
.
And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days. -- daniel 11:33
.
Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. -- daniel 11:34
.
And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed. -- daniel 11:35
.
And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done. -- daniel 11:36
.
Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. -- daniel 11:37
.
But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. -- daniel 11:38
.
Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain. -- daniel 11:39
.
And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over. -- daniel 11:40
.
He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. -- daniel 11:41
.
He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape. -- daniel 11:42
.
But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. -- daniel 11:43
.
But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many. -- daniel 11:44
.
And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him. -- daniel 11:45
.
And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. -- daniel 12:1
.
And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. -- daniel 12:2
.
And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. -- daniel 12:3
.
But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. -- daniel 12:4
.
Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. -- daniel 12:5
.
And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? -- daniel 12:6
.
And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. -- daniel 12:7
.
And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? -- daniel 12:8
.
And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. -- daniel 12:9
.
Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand. -- daniel 12:10
.
And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. -- daniel 12:11
.
Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. -- daniel 12:12
.
But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days. -- daniel 12:13
.
The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. -- hosea 1:1
.
The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD. -- hosea 1:2
.
So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. -- hosea 1:3
.
And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. -- hosea 1:4
.
And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel. -- hosea 1:5
.
And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. -- hosea 1:6
.
But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. -- hosea 1:7
.
Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. -- hosea 1:8
.
Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God. -- hosea 1:9
.
Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. -- hosea 1:10
.
Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. -- hosea 1:11
.
Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. -- hosea 2:1
.
Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; -- hosea 2:2
.
Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. -- hosea 2:3
.
And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms. -- hosea 2:4
.
For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. -- hosea 2:5
.
Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. -- hosea 2:6
.
And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now. -- hosea 2:7
.
For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. -- hosea 2:8
.
Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. -- hosea 2:9
.
And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. -- hosea 2:10
.
I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. -- hosea 2:11
.
And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. -- hosea 2:12
.
And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD. -- hosea 2:13
.
Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. -- hosea 2:14
.
And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. -- hosea 2:15
.
And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. -- hosea 2:16
.
For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name. -- hosea 2:17
.
And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely. -- hosea 2:18
.
And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. -- hosea 2:19
.
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD. -- hosea 2:20
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; -- hosea 2:21
.
And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel. -- hosea 2:22
.
And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God. -- hosea 2:23
.
Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. -- hosea 3:1
.
So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: -- hosea 3:2
.
And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee. -- hosea 3:3
.
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: -- hosea 3:4
.
Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days. -- hosea 3:5
.
Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. -- hosea 4:1
.
By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. -- hosea 4:2
.
Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. -- hosea 4:3
.
Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. -- hosea 4:4
.
Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother. -- hosea 4:5
.
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. -- hosea 4:6
.
As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame. -- hosea 4:7
.
They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. -- hosea 4:8
.
And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. -- hosea 4:9
.
For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD. -- hosea 4:10
.
Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. -- hosea 4:11
.
My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. -- hosea 4:12
.
They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. -- hosea 4:13
.
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall. -- hosea 4:14
.
Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth. -- hosea 4:15
.
For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place. -- hosea 4:16
.
Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone. -- hosea 4:17
.
Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye. -- hosea 4:18
.
The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices. -- hosea 4:19
.
Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. -- hosea 5:1
.
And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all. -- hosea 5:2
.
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled. -- hosea 5:3
.
They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD. -- hosea 5:4
.
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them. -- hosea 5:5
.
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them. -- hosea 5:6
.
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions. -- hosea 5:7
.
Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin. -- hosea 5:8
.
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. -- hosea 5:9
.
The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. -- hosea 5:10
.
Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. -- hosea 5:11
.
Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. -- hosea 5:12
.
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. -- hosea 5:13
.
For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him. -- hosea 5:14
.
I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early. -- hosea 5:15
.
Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. -- hosea 6:1
.
After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. -- hosea 6:2
.
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth. -- hosea 6:3
.
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away. -- hosea 6:4
.
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. -- hosea 6:5
.
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. -- hosea 6:6
.
But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. -- hosea 6:7
.
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood. -- hosea 6:8
.
And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness. -- hosea 6:9
.
I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. -- hosea 6:10
.
Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people. -- hosea 6:11
.
When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without. -- hosea 7:1
.
And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face. -- hosea 7:2
.
They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. -- hosea 7:3
.
They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. -- hosea 7:4
.
In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. -- hosea 7:5
.
For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. -- hosea 7:6
.
They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me. -- hosea 7:7
.
Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. -- hosea 7:8
.
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. -- hosea 7:9
.
And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this. -- hosea 7:10
.
Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. -- hosea 7:11
.
When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. -- hosea 7:12
.
Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. -- hosea 7:13
.
And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me. -- hosea 7:14
.
Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. -- hosea 7:15
.
They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt. -- hosea 7:16
.
Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. -- hosea 8:1
.
Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee. -- hosea 8:2
.
Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him. -- hosea 8:3
.
They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. -- hosea 8:4
.
Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? -- hosea 8:5
.
For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. -- hosea 8:6
.
For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. -- hosea 8:7
.
Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure. -- hosea 8:8
.
For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. -- hosea 8:9
.
Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. -- hosea 8:10
.
Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. -- hosea 8:11
.
I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing. -- hosea 8:12
.
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. -- hosea 8:13
.
For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. -- hosea 8:14
.
Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor. -- hosea 9:1
.
The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her. -- hosea 9:2
.
They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria. -- hosea 9:3
.
They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD. -- hosea 9:4
.
What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD? -- hosea 9:5
.
For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles. -- hosea 9:6
.
The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred. -- hosea 9:7
.
The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God. -- hosea 9:8
.
They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. -- hosea 9:9
.
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved. -- hosea 9:10
.
As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. -- hosea 9:11
.
Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! -- hosea 9:12
.
Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer. -- hosea 9:13
.
Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. -- hosea 9:14
.
All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters. -- hosea 9:15
.
Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. -- hosea 9:16
.
My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations. -- hosea 9:17
.
Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images. -- hosea 10:1
.
Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images. -- hosea 10:2
.
For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us? -- hosea 10:3
.
They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. -- hosea 10:4
.
The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. -- hosea 10:5
.
It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. -- hosea 10:6
.
As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water. -- hosea 10:7
.
The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us. -- hosea 10:8
.
O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them. -- hosea 10:9
.
It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows. -- hosea 10:10
.
And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods. -- hosea 10:11
.
Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. -- hosea 10:12
.
Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. -- hosea 10:13
.
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children. -- hosea 10:14
.
So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off. -- hosea 10:15
.
When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. -- hosea 11:1
.
As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. -- hosea 11:2
.
I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. -- hosea 11:3
.
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them. -- hosea 11:4
.
He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. -- hosea 11:5
.
And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels. -- hosea 11:6
.
And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him. -- hosea 11:7
.
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. -- hosea 11:8
.
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. -- hosea 11:9
.
They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west. -- hosea 11:10
.
They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD. -- hosea 11:11
.
Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints. -- hosea 11:12
.
Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt. -- hosea 12:1
.
The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. -- hosea 12:2
.
He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God: -- hosea 12:3
.
Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us; -- hosea 12:4
.
Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial. -- hosea 12:5
.
Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God continually. -- hosea 12:6
.
He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress. -- hosea 12:7
.
And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin. -- hosea 12:8
.
And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. -- hosea 12:9
.
I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. -- hosea 12:10
.
Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields. -- hosea 12:11
.
And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. -- hosea 12:12
.
And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. -- hosea 12:13
.
Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD return unto him. -- hosea 12:14
.
When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died. -- hosea 13:1
.
And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. -- hosea 13:2
.
Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney. -- hosea 13:3
.
Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me. -- hosea 13:4
.
I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. -- hosea 13:5
.
According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. -- hosea 13:6
.
Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them: -- hosea 13:7
.
I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them. -- hosea 13:8
.
O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help. -- hosea 13:9
.
I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? -- hosea 13:10
.
I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath. -- hosea 13:11
.
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid. -- hosea 13:12
.
The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children. -- hosea 13:13
.
I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes. -- hosea 13:14
.
Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels. -- hosea 13:15
.
Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. -- hosea 13:16
.
O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. -- hosea 14:1
.
Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips. -- hosea 14:2
.
Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. -- hosea 14:3
.
I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. -- hosea 14:4
.
I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. -- hosea 14:5
.
His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. -- hosea 14:6
.
They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. -- hosea 14:7
.
Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found. -- hosea 14:8
.
Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein. -- hosea 14:9
.
The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. -- joel 1:1
.
Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? -- joel 1:2
.
Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation. -- joel 1:3
.
That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. -- joel 1:4
.
Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. -- joel 1:5
.
For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. -- joel 1:6
.
He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. -- joel 1:7
.
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. -- joel 1:8
.
The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn. -- joel 1:9
.
The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. -- joel 1:10
.
Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. -- joel 1:11
.
The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men. -- joel 1:12
.
Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. -- joel 1:13
.
Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD, -- joel 1:14
.
Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. -- joel 1:15
.
Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God? -- joel 1:16
.
The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. -- joel 1:17
.
How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. -- joel 1:18
.
O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. -- joel 1:19
.
The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. -- joel 1:20
.
Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand; -- joel 2:1
.
A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. -- joel 2:2
.
A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. -- joel 2:3
.
The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run. -- joel 2:4
.
Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array. -- joel 2:5
.
Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness. -- joel 2:6
.
They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks: -- joel 2:7
.
Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded. -- joel 2:8
.
They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief. -- joel 2:9
.
The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining: -- joel 2:10
.
And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it? -- joel 2:11
.
Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: -- joel 2:12
.
And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. -- joel 2:13
.
Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God? -- joel 2:14
.
Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: -- joel 2:15
.
Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. -- joel 2:16
.
Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God? -- joel 2:17
.
Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people. -- joel 2:18
.
Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen: -- joel 2:19
.
But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things. -- joel 2:20
.
Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things. -- joel 2:21
.
Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. -- joel 2:22
.
Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. -- joel 2:23
.
And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. -- joel 2:24
.
And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. -- joel 2:25
.
And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed. -- joel 2:26
.
And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed. -- joel 2:27
.
And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: -- joel 2:28
.
And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. -- joel 2:29
.
And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. -- joel 2:30
.
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come. -- joel 2:31
.
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call. -- joel 2:32
.
For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, -- joel 3:1
.
I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land. -- joel 3:2
.
And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink. -- joel 3:3
.
Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head; -- joel 3:4
.
Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: -- joel 3:5
.
The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. -- joel 3:6
.
Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: -- joel 3:7
.
And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it. -- joel 3:8
.
Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: -- joel 3:9
.
Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. -- joel 3:10
.
Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD. -- joel 3:11
.
Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. -- joel 3:12
.
Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great. -- joel 3:13
.
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision. -- joel 3:14
.
The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining. -- joel 3:15
.
The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. -- joel 3:16
.
So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more. -- joel 3:17
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim. -- joel 3:18
.
Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. -- joel 3:19
.
But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. -- joel 3:20
.
For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion. -- joel 3:21
.
The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. -- amos 1:1
.
And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither. -- amos 1:2
.

.

.

.
And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD. -- amos 1:8
.
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant: -- amos 1:9
.
But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof. -- amos 1:10
.
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever: -- amos 1:11
.
But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. -- amos 1:12
.
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border: -- amos 1:13
.
But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: -- amos 1:14
.
And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD. -- amos 1:15
.
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: -- amos 2:1
.
But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet: -- amos 2:2
.
And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD. -- amos 2:3
.
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked: -- amos 2:4
.
But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. -- amos 2:5
.
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; -- amos 2:6
.
That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name: -- amos 2:7
.
And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god. -- amos 2:8
.
Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. -- amos 2:9
.
Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. -- amos 2:10
.
And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD. -- amos 2:11
.
But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. -- amos 2:12
.
Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves. -- amos 2:13
.
Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: -- amos 2:14
.
Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself. -- amos 2:15
.
And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD. -- amos 2:16
.
Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, -- amos 3:1
.
You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. -- amos 3:2
.
Can two walk together, except they be agreed? -- amos 3:3
.
Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing? -- amos 3:4
.
Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all? -- amos 3:5
.
Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it? -- amos 3:6
.
Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets. -- amos 3:7
.
The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy? -- amos 3:8
.
Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof. -- amos 3:9
.
For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces. -- amos 3:10
.
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled. -- amos 3:11
.
Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch. -- amos 3:12
.
Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts, -- amos 3:13
.
That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground. -- amos 3:14
.
And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD. -- amos 3:15
.
Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink. -- amos 4:1
.
The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks. -- amos 4:2
.
And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD. -- amos 4:3
.
Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years: -- amos 4:4
.
And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. -- amos 4:5
.
And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. -- amos 4:6
.
And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. -- amos 4:7
.
So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. -- amos 4:8
.
I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. -- amos 4:9
.
I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. -- amos 4:10
.
I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. -- amos 4:11
.
Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. -- amos 4:12
.
For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name. -- amos 4:13
.
Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel. -- amos 5:1
.
The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up. -- amos 5:2
.
For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel. -- amos 5:3
.
For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live: -- amos 5:4
.
But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought. -- amos 5:5
.
Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel. -- amos 5:6
.
Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, -- amos 5:7
.
Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name: -- amos 5:8
.
That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress. -- amos 5:9
.
They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. -- amos 5:10
.
Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. -- amos 5:11
.
For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right. -- amos 5:12
.
Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time. -- amos 5:13
.
Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken. -- amos 5:14
.
Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. -- amos 5:15
.
Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. -- amos 5:16
.
And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD. -- amos 5:17
.
Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light. -- amos 5:18
.
As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. -- amos 5:19
.
Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it? -- amos 5:20
.
I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. -- amos 5:21
.
Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. -- amos 5:22
.
Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. -- amos 5:23
.
But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream. -- amos 5:24
.
Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? -- amos 5:25
.
But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. -- amos 5:26
.
Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts. -- amos 5:27
.
Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came! -- amos 6:1
.
Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border? -- amos 6:2
.
Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; -- amos 6:3
.
That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; -- amos 6:4
.
That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David; -- amos 6:5
.
That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. -- amos 6:6
.
Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed. -- amos 6:7
.
The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. -- amos 6:8
.
And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. -- amos 6:9
.
And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD. -- amos 6:10
.
For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts. -- amos 6:11
.
Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock: -- amos 6:12
.
Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? -- amos 6:13
.
But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness. -- amos 6:14
.
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings. -- amos 7:1
.
And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. -- amos 7:2
.
The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD. -- amos 7:3
.
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part. -- amos 7:4
.
Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. -- amos 7:5
.
The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD. -- amos 7:6
.
Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. -- amos 7:7
.
And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more: -- amos 7:8
.
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. -- amos 7:9
.
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. -- amos 7:10
.
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land. -- amos 7:11
.
Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: -- amos 7:12
.
But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court. -- amos 7:13
.
Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: -- amos 7:14
.
And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. -- amos 7:15
.
Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac. -- amos 7:16
.
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land. -- amos 7:17
.
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit. -- amos 8:1
.
And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more. -- amos 8:2
.
And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence. -- amos 8:3
.
Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail, -- amos 8:4
.
Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit? -- amos 8:5
.
That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat? -- amos 8:6
.
The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works. -- amos 8:7
.
Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt. -- amos 8:8
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day: -- amos 8:9
.
And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day. -- amos 8:10
.
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD: -- amos 8:11
.
And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it. -- amos 8:12
.
In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. -- amos 8:13
.
They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again. -- amos 8:14
.
I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. -- amos 9:1
.
Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: -- amos 9:2
.
And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them: -- amos 9:3
.
And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. -- amos 9:4
.
And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt. -- amos 9:5
.
It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name. -- amos 9:6
.
Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? -- amos 9:7
.
Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD. -- amos 9:8
.
For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth. -- amos 9:9
.
All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us. -- amos 9:10
.
In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: -- amos 9:11
.
That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this. -- amos 9:12
.
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt. -- amos 9:13
.
And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. -- amos 9:14
.
And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God. -- amos 9:15
.
The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle. -- obadiah 1:1
.
Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised. -- obadiah 1:2
.
The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? -- obadiah 1:3
.
Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD. -- obadiah 1:4
.
If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes? -- obadiah 1:5
.
How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up! -- obadiah 1:6
.
All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him. -- obadiah 1:7
.
Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau? -- obadiah 1:8
.
And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter. -- obadiah 1:9
.
For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. -- obadiah 1:10
.
In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. -- obadiah 1:11
.
But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. -- obadiah 1:12
.
Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; -- obadiah 1:13
.
Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress. -- obadiah 1:14
.
For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. -- obadiah 1:15
.
For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been. -- obadiah 1:16
.
But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. -- obadiah 1:17
.
And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it. -- obadiah 1:18
.
And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead. -- obadiah 1:19
.
And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south. -- obadiah 1:20
.
And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's. -- obadiah 1:21
.
Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, -- jonah 1:1
.
Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. -- jonah 1:2
.
But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. -- jonah 1:3
.
But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. -- jonah 1:4
.
Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. -- jonah 1:5
.
So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not. -- jonah 1:6
.
And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. -- jonah 1:7
.
Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? -- jonah 1:8
.
And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. -- jonah 1:9
.
Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. -- jonah 1:10
.
Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. -- jonah 1:11
.
And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. -- jonah 1:12
.
Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them. -- jonah 1:13
.
Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee. -- jonah 1:14
.
So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging. -- jonah 1:15
.
Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows. -- jonah 1:16
.
Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. -- jonah 1:17
.
Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly, -- jonah 2:1
.
And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. -- jonah 2:2
.
For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. -- jonah 2:3
.
Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. -- jonah 2:4
.
The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. -- jonah 2:5
.
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God. -- jonah 2:6
.
When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. -- jonah 2:7
.
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. -- jonah 2:8
.
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD. -- jonah 2:9
.
And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. -- jonah 2:10
.
And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, -- jonah 3:1
.
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. -- jonah 3:2
.
So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. -- jonah 3:3
.
And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. -- jonah 3:4
.
So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. -- jonah 3:5
.
For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. -- jonah 3:6
.
And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: -- jonah 3:7
.
But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. -- jonah 3:8
.
Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? -- jonah 3:9
.
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not. -- jonah 3:10
.
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. -- jonah 4:1
.
And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. -- jonah 4:2
.
Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. -- jonah 4:3
.
Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry? -- jonah 4:4
.
So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. -- jonah 4:5
.
And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. -- jonah 4:6
.
But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. -- jonah 4:7
.
And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. -- jonah 4:8
.
And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death. -- jonah 4:9
.
Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: -- jonah 4:10
.
And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle? -- jonah 4:11
.
The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. -- micah 1:1
.
Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from his holy temple. -- micah 1:2
.
For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. -- micah 1:3
.
And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place. -- micah 1:4
.
For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? -- micah 1:5
.
Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof. -- micah 1:6
.
And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot. -- micah 1:7
.
Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. -- micah 1:8
.
For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. -- micah 1:9
.
Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust. -- micah 1:10
.
Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing. -- micah 1:11
.
For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem. -- micah 1:12
.
O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee. -- micah 1:13
.
Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel. -- micah 1:14
.
Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel. -- micah 1:15
.
Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee. -- micah 1:16
.
Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. -- micah 2:1
.
And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. -- micah 2:2
.
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil. -- micah 2:3
.
In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. -- micah 2:4
.
Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD. -- micah 2:5
.
Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame. -- micah 2:6
.
O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? -- micah 2:7
.
Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. -- micah 2:8
.
The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. -- micah 2:9
.
Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction. -- micah 2:10
.
If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. -- micah 2:11
.
I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men. -- micah 2:12
.
The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them. -- micah 2:13
.
And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? -- micah 3:1
.
Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; -- micah 3:2
.
Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. -- micah 3:3
.
Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. -- micah 3:4
.
Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him. -- micah 3:5
.
Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. -- micah 3:6
.
Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God. -- micah 3:7
.
But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. -- micah 3:8
.
Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. -- micah 3:9
.
They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. -- micah 3:10
.
The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us. -- micah 3:11
.
Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest. -- micah 3:12
.
But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. -- micah 4:1
.
And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. -- micah 4:2
.
And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. -- micah 4:3
.
But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it. -- micah 4:4
.
For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. -- micah 4:5
.
In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; -- micah 4:6
.
And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. -- micah 4:7
.
And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. -- micah 4:8
.
Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. -- micah 4:9
.
Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. -- micah 4:10
.
Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. -- micah 4:11
.
But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. -- micah 4:12
.
Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. -- micah 4:13
.
Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. -- micah 5:1
.
But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. -- micah 5:2
.
Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. -- micah 5:3
.
And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. -- micah 5:4
.
And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men. -- micah 5:5
.
And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders. -- micah 5:6
.
And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. -- micah 5:7
.
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. -- micah 5:8
.
Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off. -- micah 5:9
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots: -- micah 5:10
.
And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: -- micah 5:11
.
And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: -- micah 5:12
.
Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. -- micah 5:13
.
And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities. -- micah 5:14
.
And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard. -- micah 5:15
.
Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. -- micah 6:1
.
Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel. -- micah 6:2
.
O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. -- micah 6:3
.
For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. -- micah 6:4
.
O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD. -- micah 6:5
.
Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? -- micah 6:6
.
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? -- micah 6:7
.
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? -- micah 6:8
.
The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. -- micah 6:9
.
Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable? -- micah 6:10
.
Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights? -- micah 6:11
.
For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. -- micah 6:12
.
Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins. -- micah 6:13
.
Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword. -- micah 6:14
.
Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. -- micah 6:15
.
For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people. -- micah 6:16
.
Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit. -- micah 7:1
.
The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. -- micah 7:2
.
That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up. -- micah 7:3
.
The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity. -- micah 7:4
.
Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. -- micah 7:5
.
For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house. -- micah 7:6
.
Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. -- micah 7:7
.
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me. -- micah 7:8
.
I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness. -- micah 7:9
.
Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. -- micah 7:10
.
In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed. -- micah 7:11
.
In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. -- micah 7:12
.
Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. -- micah 7:13
.
Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. -- micah 7:14
.
According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things. -- micah 7:15
.
The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf. -- micah 7:16
.
They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee. -- micah 7:17
.
Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. -- micah 7:18
.
He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. -- micah 7:19
.
Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. -- micah 7:20
.
The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. -- nahum 1:1
.
God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. -- nahum 1:2
.
The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. -- nahum 1:3
.
He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. -- nahum 1:4
.
The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. -- nahum 1:5
.
Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. -- nahum 1:6
.
The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. -- nahum 1:7
.
But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. -- nahum 1:8
.
What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time. -- nahum 1:9
.
For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry. -- nahum 1:10
.
There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor. -- nahum 1:11
.
Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. -- nahum 1:12
.
For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. -- nahum 1:13
.
And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile. -- nahum 1:14
.
Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off. -- nahum 1:15
.
He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. -- nahum 2:1
.
For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches. -- nahum 2:2
.
The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken. -- nahum 2:3
.
The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings. -- nahum 2:4
.
He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. -- nahum 2:5
.
The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved. -- nahum 2:6
.
And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts. -- nahum 2:7
.
But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back. -- nahum 2:8
.
Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture. -- nahum 2:9
.
She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness. -- nahum 2:10
.
Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid? -- nahum 2:11
.
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin. -- nahum 2:12
.
Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard. -- nahum 2:13
.
Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not; -- nahum 3:1
.
The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots. -- nahum 3:2
.
The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: -- nahum 3:3
.
Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. -- nahum 3:4
.
Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. -- nahum 3:5
.
And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock. -- nahum 3:6
.
And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee? -- nahum 3:7
.
Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea? -- nahum 3:8
.
Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. -- nahum 3:9
.
Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. -- nahum 3:10
.
Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy. -- nahum 3:11
.
All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater. -- nahum 3:12
.
Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars. -- nahum 3:13
.
Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln. -- nahum 3:14
.
There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts. -- nahum 3:15
.
Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away. -- nahum 3:16
.
Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are. -- nahum 3:17
.
Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them. -- nahum 3:18
.
There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually? -- nahum 3:19
.
The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. -- habakkuk 1:1
.
O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save! -- habakkuk 1:2
.
Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention. -- habakkuk 1:3
.
Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. -- habakkuk 1:4
.
Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told you. -- habakkuk 1:5
.
For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's. -- habakkuk 1:6
.
They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. -- habakkuk 1:7
.
Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. -- habakkuk 1:8
.
They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. -- habakkuk 1:9
.
And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. -- habakkuk 1:10
.
Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god. -- habakkuk 1:11
.
Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. -- habakkuk 1:12
.
Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? -- habakkuk 1:13
.
And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? -- habakkuk 1:14
.
They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. -- habakkuk 1:15
.
Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous. -- habakkuk 1:16
.
Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations? -- habakkuk 1:17
.
I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved. -- habakkuk 2:1
.
And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. -- habakkuk 2:2
.
For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry. -- habakkuk 2:3
.
Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith. -- habakkuk 2:4
.
Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people: -- habakkuk 2:5
.
Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! -- habakkuk 2:6
.
Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? -- habakkuk 2:7
.
Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. -- habakkuk 2:8
.
Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil! -- habakkuk 2:9
.
Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul. -- habakkuk 2:10
.
For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it. -- habakkuk 2:11
.
Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity! -- habakkuk 2:12
.
Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity? -- habakkuk 2:13
.
For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. -- habakkuk 2:14
.
Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! -- habakkuk 2:15
.
Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory. -- habakkuk 2:16
.
For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. -- habakkuk 2:17
.
What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? -- habakkuk 2:18
.
Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. -- habakkuk 2:19
.
But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him. -- habakkuk 2:20
.
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. -- habakkuk 3:1
.
O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy. -- habakkuk 3:2
.
God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. -- habakkuk 3:3
.
And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power. -- habakkuk 3:4
.
Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet. -- habakkuk 3:5
.
He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting. -- habakkuk 3:6
.
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. -- habakkuk 3:7
.
Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation? -- habakkuk 3:8
.
Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. -- habakkuk 3:9
.
The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high. -- habakkuk 3:10
.
The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear. -- habakkuk 3:11
.
Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger. -- habakkuk 3:12
.
Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah. -- habakkuk 3:13
.
Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly. -- habakkuk 3:14
.
Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters. -- habakkuk 3:15
.
When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops. -- habakkuk 3:16
.
Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: -- habakkuk 3:17
.
Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation. -- habakkuk 3:18
.
The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments. -- habakkuk 3:19
.
The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah. -- zephaniah 1:1
.
I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the LORD. -- zephaniah 1:2
.
I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD. -- zephaniah 1:3
.
I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests; -- zephaniah 1:4
.
And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham; -- zephaniah 1:5
.
And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him. -- zephaniah 1:6
.
Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests. -- zephaniah 1:7
.
And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel. -- zephaniah 1:8
.
In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit. -- zephaniah 1:9
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills. -- zephaniah 1:10
.
Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off. -- zephaniah 1:11
.
And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil. -- zephaniah 1:12
.
Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof. -- zephaniah 1:13
.
The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. -- zephaniah 1:14
.
That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, -- zephaniah 1:15
.
A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers. -- zephaniah 1:16
.
And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung. -- zephaniah 1:17
.
Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land. -- zephaniah 1:18
.
Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired; -- zephaniah 2:1
.
Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD's anger come upon you. -- zephaniah 2:2
.
Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger. -- zephaniah 2:3
.
For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up. -- zephaniah 2:4
.
Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. -- zephaniah 2:5
.
And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks. -- zephaniah 2:6
.
And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity. -- zephaniah 2:7
.
I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. -- zephaniah 2:8
.
Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them. -- zephaniah 2:9
.

And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work. -- zephaniah 2:14
.
This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand. -- zephaniah 2:15
.
Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! -- zephaniah 3:1
.
She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God. -- zephaniah 3:2
.
Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. -- zephaniah 3:3
.
Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. -- zephaniah 3:4
.

.
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. -- zephaniah 3:10
.
In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. -- zephaniah 3:11
.
I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD. -- zephaniah 3:12

.
In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. -- zephaniah 3:16
.
The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. -- zephaniah 3:17
.
I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. -- zephaniah 3:18
.

.
At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD. -- zephaniah 3:20
.
In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying, -- haggai 1:1
.
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built. -- haggai 1:2
.
Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying, -- haggai 1:3
.
Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste? -- haggai 1:4
.
Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. -- haggai 1:5
.
Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. -- haggai 1:6
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. -- haggai 1:7
.
Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD. -- haggai 1:8
.
Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. -- haggai 1:9
.
Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. -- haggai 1:10
.
And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands. -- haggai 1:11
.
Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD. -- haggai 1:12
.
Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD. -- haggai 1:13
.
And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, -- haggai 1:14
.
In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king. -- haggai 1:15
.
In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying, -- haggai 2:1
.
Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, -- haggai 2:2
.
Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? -- haggai 2:3
.
Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts: -- haggai 2:4
.
According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. -- haggai 2:5
.
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; -- haggai 2:6
.
And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts. -- haggai 2:7
.
The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts. -- haggai 2:8
.
The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts. -- haggai 2:9
.
In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying, -- haggai 2:10
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying, -- haggai 2:11
.
If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. -- haggai 2:12
.
Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean. -- haggai 2:13
.
Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. -- haggai 2:14
.
And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD: -- haggai 2:15
.
Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty. -- haggai 2:16
.
I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD. -- haggai 2:17
.
Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it. -- haggai 2:18
.
Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you. -- haggai 2:19
.
And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying, -- haggai 2:20
.
Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; -- haggai 2:21
.
And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. -- haggai 2:22
.
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts. -- haggai 2:23
.
In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, -- zechariah 1:1
.
The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers. -- zechariah 1:2
.
Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 1:3
.
Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD. -- zechariah 1:4
.
Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? -- zechariah 1:5
.
But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us. -- zechariah 1:6
.
Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, -- zechariah 1:7
.
I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white. -- zechariah 1:8
.
Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be. -- zechariah 1:9
.
And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. -- zechariah 1:10
.
And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest. -- zechariah 1:11
.
Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? -- zechariah 1:12
.
And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words. -- zechariah 1:13
.
So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. -- zechariah 1:14
.
And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. -- zechariah 1:15
.
Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. -- zechariah 1:16
.
Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. -- zechariah 1:17
.
Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. -- zechariah 1:18
.
And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. -- zechariah 1:19
.
And the LORD shewed me four carpenters. -- zechariah 1:20
.
Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it. -- zechariah 1:21
.
I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. -- zechariah 2:1
.
Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. -- zechariah 2:2
.
And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, -- zechariah 2:3
.
And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein: -- zechariah 2:4
.
For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. -- zechariah 2:5
.
Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. -- zechariah 2:6
.
Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. -- zechariah 2:7
.
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. -- zechariah 2:8
.
For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. -- zechariah 2:9
.
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. -- zechariah 2:10
.
And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee. -- zechariah 2:11
.
And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. -- zechariah 2:12
.
Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation. -- zechariah 2:13
.
And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. -- zechariah 3:1
.
And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? -- zechariah 3:2
.
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. -- zechariah 3:3
.
And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. -- zechariah 3:4
.
And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by. -- zechariah 3:5
.
And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, -- zechariah 3:6
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. -- zechariah 3:7
.
Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. -- zechariah 3:8
.
For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. -- zechariah 3:9
.
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree. -- zechariah 3:10
.
And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep. -- zechariah 4:1
.
And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: -- zechariah 4:2
.
And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. -- zechariah 4:3
.
So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? -- zechariah 4:4
.
Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. -- zechariah 4:5
.
Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 4:6
.
Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it. -- zechariah 4:7
.
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, -- zechariah 4:8
.
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. -- zechariah 4:9
.
For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. -- zechariah 4:10
.
Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof? -- zechariah 4:11
.
And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? -- zechariah 4:12
.
And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. -- zechariah 4:13
.
Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth. -- zechariah 4:14
.
Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll. -- zechariah 5:1
.
And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. -- zechariah 5:2
.
Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it. -- zechariah 5:3
.
I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. -- zechariah 5:4
.
Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth. -- zechariah 5:5
.
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth. -- zechariah 5:6
.
And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. -- zechariah 5:7
.
And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. -- zechariah 5:8
.
Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. -- zechariah 5:9
.
Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? -- zechariah 5:10
.
And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base. -- zechariah 5:11
.
And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. -- zechariah 6:1
.
In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; -- zechariah 6:2
.
And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. -- zechariah 6:3
.
Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? -- zechariah 6:4
.
And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth. -- zechariah 6:5
.
The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. -- zechariah 6:6
.
And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. -- zechariah 6:7
.
Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. -- zechariah 6:8
.
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, -- zechariah 6:9
.
Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; -- zechariah 6:10
.
Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; -- zechariah 6:11
.
And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: -- zechariah 6:12
.
Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. -- zechariah 6:13
.
And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. -- zechariah 6:14
.
And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God. -- zechariah 6:15
.
And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu; -- zechariah 7:1
.
When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, -- zechariah 7:2
.
And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? -- zechariah 7:3
.
Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, -- zechariah 7:4
.
Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me? -- zechariah 7:5
.
And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? -- zechariah 7:6
.
Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain? -- zechariah 7:7
.
And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying, -- zechariah 7:8
.
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: -- zechariah 7:9
.
And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. -- zechariah 7:10
.
But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. -- zechariah 7:11
.
Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 7:12
.
Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: -- zechariah 7:13
.
But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. -- zechariah 7:14
.
Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, -- zechariah 8:1
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. -- zechariah 8:2
.
Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain. -- zechariah 8:3
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age. -- zechariah 8:4
.
And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. -- zechariah 8:5
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 8:6
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; -- zechariah 8:7
.
And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness. -- zechariah 8:8
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. -- zechariah 8:9
.
For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. -- zechariah 8:10
.
But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 8:11
.
For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. -- zechariah 8:12
.
And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong. -- zechariah 8:13
.
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not: -- zechariah 8:14
.
So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. -- zechariah 8:15
.
These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: -- zechariah 8:16
.
And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD. -- zechariah 8:17
.
And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, -- zechariah 8:18
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. -- zechariah 8:19
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: -- zechariah 8:20
.
And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also. -- zechariah 8:21
.
Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD. -- zechariah 8:22
.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you. -- zechariah 8:23
.
The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD. -- zechariah 9:1
.
And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise. -- zechariah 9:2
.
And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. -- zechariah 9:3
.
Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. -- zechariah 9:4
.
Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. -- zechariah 9:5
.
And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. -- zechariah 9:6
.
And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. -- zechariah 9:7
.
And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. -- zechariah 9:8
.
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. -- zechariah 9:9
.
And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. -- zechariah 9:10
.
As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water. -- zechariah 9:11
.
Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee; -- zechariah 9:12
.
When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man. -- zechariah 9:13
.
And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south. -- zechariah 9:14
.
The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar. -- zechariah 9:15
.
And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land. -- zechariah 9:16
.
For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids. -- zechariah 9:17
.
Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. -- zechariah 10:1
.
For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd. -- zechariah 10:2
.
Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle. -- zechariah 10:3
.
Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together. -- zechariah 10:4
.
And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded. -- zechariah 10:5
.
And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them. -- zechariah 10:6
.
And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. -- zechariah 10:7
.
I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. -- zechariah 10:8
.
And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. -- zechariah 10:9
.
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them. -- zechariah 10:10
.
And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. -- zechariah 10:11
.
And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD. -- zechariah 10:12
.
Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. -- zechariah 11:1
.
Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. -- zechariah 11:2
.
There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled. -- zechariah 11:3
.
Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; -- zechariah 11:4
.
Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. -- zechariah 11:5
.
For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them. -- zechariah 11:6
.
And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. -- zechariah 11:7
.
Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. -- zechariah 11:8
.
Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. -- zechariah 11:9
.
And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. -- zechariah 11:10
.
And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD. -- zechariah 11:11
.
And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. -- zechariah 11:12
.
And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. -- zechariah 11:13
.
Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. -- zechariah 11:14
.
And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. -- zechariah 11:15
.
For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. -- zechariah 11:16
.
Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. -- zechariah 11:17
.
The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. -- zechariah 12:1
.
Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. -- zechariah 12:2
.
And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it. -- zechariah 12:3
.
In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. -- zechariah 12:4
.
And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God. -- zechariah 12:5
.
In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem. -- zechariah 12:6
.
The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah. -- zechariah 12:7
.
In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them. -- zechariah 12:8
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. -- zechariah 12:9
.
And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. -- zechariah 12:10
.
In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. -- zechariah 12:11
.
And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; -- zechariah 12:12
.
The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; -- zechariah 12:13
.
All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart. -- zechariah 12:14
.
In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. -- zechariah 13:1
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. -- zechariah 13:2
.
And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. -- zechariah 13:3
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: -- zechariah 13:4
.
But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. -- zechariah 13:5
.
And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. -- zechariah 13:6
.
Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. -- zechariah 13:7
.
And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein. -- zechariah 13:8
.
And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God. -- zechariah 13:9
.
Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. -- zechariah 14:1
.
For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. -- zechariah 14:2
.
Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. -- zechariah 14:3
.
And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. -- zechariah 14:4
.
And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee. -- zechariah 14:5
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark: -- zechariah 14:6
.
But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light. -- zechariah 14:7
.
And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. -- zechariah 14:8
.
And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one. -- zechariah 14:9
.
All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses. -- zechariah 14:10
.
And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. -- zechariah 14:11
.
And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. -- zechariah 14:12
.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour. -- zechariah 14:13
.
And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. -- zechariah 14:14
.
And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague. -- zechariah 14:15
.
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. -- zechariah 14:16
.
And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain. -- zechariah 14:17
.
And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. -- zechariah 14:18
.
This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. -- zechariah 14:19
.
In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall be like the bowls before the altar. -- zechariah 14:20
.
Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 14:21
.
The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi. -- malachi 1:1
.
I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob, -- malachi 1:2
.
And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. -- malachi 1:3
.
Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever. -- malachi 1:4
.
And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel. -- malachi 1:5
.
A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? -- malachi 1:6
.
Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible. -- malachi 1:7
.
And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 1:8
.
And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 1:9
.
Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. -- malachi 1:10
.
For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 1:11
.
But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible. -- malachi 1:12
.
Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD. -- malachi 1:13
.
But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen. -- malachi 1:14
.
And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you. -- malachi 2:1
.
If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. -- malachi 2:2
.
Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it. -- malachi 2:3
.
And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 2:4
.
My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name. -- malachi 2:5
.
The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity. -- malachi 2:6
.
For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 2:7
.
But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 2:8
.
Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law. -- malachi 2:9
.
Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers? -- malachi 2:10
.
Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god. -- malachi 2:11
.
The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 2:12
.
And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand. -- malachi 2:13
.
Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. -- malachi 2:14
.
And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. -- malachi 2:15
.
For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously. -- malachi 2:16
.
Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment? -- malachi 2:17
.
Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 3:1
.
But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: -- malachi 3:2
.
And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness. -- malachi 3:3
.
Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years. -- malachi 3:4
.
And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 3:5
.
For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. -- malachi 3:6
.
Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? -- malachi 3:7
.
Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. -- malachi 3:8
.
Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. -- malachi 3:9
.
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. -- malachi 3:10
.
And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 3:11
.
And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 3:12
.
Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee? -- malachi 3:13
.
Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts? -- malachi 3:14
.
And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. -- malachi 3:15
.
Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name. -- malachi 3:16
.
And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. -- malachi 3:17
.
Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not. -- malachi 3:18
.
For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. -- malachi 4:1
.
But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. -- malachi 4:2
.
And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 4:3
.
Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. -- malachi 4:4
.
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: -- malachi 4:5
.
And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. -- malachi 4:6
.
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. -- matthew 1:1
.
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; -- matthew 1:2
.
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; -- matthew 1:3
.
And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; -- matthew 1:4
.
And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; -- matthew 1:5
.
And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; -- matthew 1:6
.
And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; -- matthew 1:7
.
And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; -- matthew 1:8
.
And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; -- matthew 1:9
.
And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; -- matthew 1:10
.
And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: -- matthew 1:11
.
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; -- matthew 1:12
.
And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; -- matthew 1:13
.
And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; -- matthew 1:14
.
And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; -- matthew 1:15
.
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. -- matthew 1:16
.
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. -- matthew 1:17
.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. -- matthew 1:18
.
Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. -- matthew 1:19
.
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. -- matthew 1:20
.
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. -- matthew 1:21
.
Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, -- matthew 1:22
.
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. -- matthew 1:23
.
Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: -- matthew 1:24
.
And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS. -- matthew 1:25
.
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, -- matthew 2:1
.
Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. -- matthew 2:2
.
When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. -- matthew 2:3
.
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. -- matthew 2:4
.
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, -- matthew 2:5
.
And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. -- matthew 2:6
.
Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. -- matthew 2:7
.
And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. -- matthew 2:8
.
When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. -- matthew 2:9
.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. -- matthew 2:10
.
And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh. -- matthew 2:11
.
And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. -- matthew 2:12
.
And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. -- matthew 2:13
.
When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: -- matthew 2:14
.
And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. -- matthew 2:15
.
Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. -- matthew 2:16
.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, -- matthew 2:17
.
In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. -- matthew 2:18
.
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, -- matthew 2:19
.
Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. -- matthew 2:20
.
And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. -- matthew 2:21
.
But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: -- matthew 2:22
.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. -- matthew 2:23
.
In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, -- matthew 3:1
.
And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. -- matthew 3:2
.
For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. -- matthew 3:3
.
And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. -- matthew 3:4
.
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, -- matthew 3:5
.
And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. -- matthew 3:6
.
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? -- matthew 3:7
.
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: -- matthew 3:8
.
And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. -- matthew 3:9
.
And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. -- matthew 3:10
.
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: -- matthew 3:11
.
Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. -- matthew 3:12
.
Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. -- matthew 3:13
.
But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? -- matthew 3:14
.
And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. -- matthew 3:15
.
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: -- matthew 3:16
.
And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- matthew 3:17
.
Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. -- matthew 4:1
.
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. -- matthew 4:2
.
And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. -- matthew 4:3
.
But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. -- matthew 4:4
.
Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, -- matthew 4:5
.
And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. -- matthew 4:6
.
Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. -- matthew 4:7
.
Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; -- matthew 4:8
.
And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. -- matthew 4:9
.
Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. -- matthew 4:10
.
Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. -- matthew 4:11
.
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; -- matthew 4:12
.
And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: -- matthew 4:13
.
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, -- matthew 4:14
.
The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; -- matthew 4:15
.
The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. -- matthew 4:16
.
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. -- matthew 4:17
.
And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. -- matthew 4:18
.
And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. -- matthew 4:19
.
And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. -- matthew 4:20
.
And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. -- matthew 4:21
.
And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. -- matthew 4:22
.
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. -- matthew 4:23
.
And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. -- matthew 4:24
.
And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan. -- matthew 4:25
.
And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: -- matthew 5:1
.
And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, -- matthew 5:2
.
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:3
.
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. -- matthew 5:4
.
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. -- matthew 5:5
.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. -- matthew 5:6
.
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. -- matthew 5:7
.
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. -- matthew 5:8
.
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. -- matthew 5:9
.
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:10
.
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. -- matthew 5:11
.
Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. -- matthew 5:12
.
Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. -- matthew 5:13
.
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. -- matthew 5:14
.
Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. -- matthew 5:15
.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. -- matthew 5:16
.
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. -- matthew 5:17
.
For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. -- matthew 5:18
.
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:19
.
For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:20
.
Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: -- matthew 5:21
.
But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. -- matthew 5:22
.
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; -- matthew 5:23
.
Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. -- matthew 5:24
.
Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. -- matthew 5:25
.
Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. -- matthew 5:26
.
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: -- matthew 5:27
.
But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. -- matthew 5:28
.
And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. -- matthew 5:29
.
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. -- matthew 5:30
.
It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: -- matthew 5:31
.
But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. -- matthew 5:32
.
Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: -- matthew 5:33
.
But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: -- matthew 5:34
.
Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. -- matthew 5:35
.
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. -- matthew 5:36
.
But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. -- matthew 5:37
.
Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: -- matthew 5:38
.
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. -- matthew 5:39
.
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. -- matthew 5:40
.
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. -- matthew 5:41
.
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. -- matthew 5:42
.
Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. -- matthew 5:43
.
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; -- matthew 5:44
.
That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. -- matthew 5:45
.
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? -- matthew 5:46
.
And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? -- matthew 5:47
.
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. -- matthew 5:48
.
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. -- matthew 6:1
.
Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. -- matthew 6:2
.
But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: -- matthew 6:3
.
That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. -- matthew 6:4
.
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. -- matthew 6:5
.
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. -- matthew 6:6
.
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. -- matthew 6:7
.
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. -- matthew 6:8
.
After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. -- matthew 6:9
.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. -- matthew 6:10
.
Give us this day our daily bread. -- matthew 6:11
.
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. -- matthew 6:12
.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. -- matthew 6:13
.
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: -- matthew 6:14
.
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. -- matthew 6:15
.
Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. -- matthew 6:16
.
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; -- matthew 6:17
.
That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. -- matthew 6:18
.
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: -- matthew 6:19
.
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: -- matthew 6:20
.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. -- matthew 6:21
.
The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. -- matthew 6:22
.
But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! -- matthew 6:23
.
No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. -- matthew 6:24
.
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? -- matthew 6:25
.
Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? -- matthew 6:26
.
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? -- matthew 6:27
.
And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: -- matthew 6:28
.
And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. -- matthew 6:29
.
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? -- matthew 6:30
.
Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? -- matthew 6:31
.
(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. -- matthew 6:32
.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. -- matthew 6:33
.
Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. -- matthew 6:34
.
Judge not, that ye be not judged. -- matthew 7:1
.
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. -- matthew 7:2
.
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? -- matthew 7:3
.
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? -- matthew 7:4
.
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. -- matthew 7:5
.
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. -- matthew 7:6
.
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: -- matthew 7:7
.
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. -- matthew 7:8
.
Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? -- matthew 7:9
.
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? -- matthew 7:10
.
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? -- matthew 7:11
.
Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. -- matthew 7:12
.
Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: -- matthew 7:13
.
Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. -- matthew 7:14
.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. -- matthew 7:15
.
Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? -- matthew 7:16
.
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. -- matthew 7:17
.
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. -- matthew 7:18
.
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. -- matthew 7:19
.
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. -- matthew 7:20
.
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. -- matthew 7:21
.
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? -- matthew 7:22
.
And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. -- matthew 7:23
.
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: -- matthew 7:24
.
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. -- matthew 7:25
.
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: -- matthew 7:26
.
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. -- matthew 7:27
.
And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: -- matthew 7:28
.
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. -- matthew 7:29
.
When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. -- matthew 8:1
.
And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. -- matthew 8:2
.
And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. -- matthew 8:3
.
And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. -- matthew 8:4
.
And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, -- matthew 8:5
.
And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. -- matthew 8:6
.
And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. -- matthew 8:7
.
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. -- matthew 8:8
.
For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. -- matthew 8:9
.
When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. -- matthew 8:10
.
And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 8:11
.
But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 8:12
.
And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. -- matthew 8:13
.
And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever. -- matthew 8:14
.
And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. -- matthew 8:15
.
When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: -- matthew 8:16
.
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. -- matthew 8:17
.
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side. -- matthew 8:18
.
And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. -- matthew 8:19
.
And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. -- matthew 8:20
.
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. -- matthew 8:21
.
But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. -- matthew 8:22
.
And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. -- matthew 8:23
.
And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. -- matthew 8:24
.
And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. -- matthew 8:25
.
And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. -- matthew 8:26
.
But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! -- matthew 8:27
.
And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. -- matthew 8:28
.
And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? -- matthew 8:29
.
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. -- matthew 8:30
.
So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. -- matthew 8:31
.
And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. -- matthew 8:32
.
And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. -- matthew 8:33
.
And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts. -- matthew 8:34
.
And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city. -- matthew 9:1
.
And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. -- matthew 9:2
.
And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. -- matthew 9:3
.
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? -- matthew 9:4
.
For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk? -- matthew 9:5
.
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. -- matthew 9:6
.
And he arose, and departed to his house. -- matthew 9:7
.
But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men. -- matthew 9:8
.
And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. -- matthew 9:9
.
And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. -- matthew 9:10
.
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? -- matthew 9:11
.
But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. -- matthew 9:12
.
But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. -- matthew 9:13
.
Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? -- matthew 9:14
.
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. -- matthew 9:15
.
No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. -- matthew 9:16
.
Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. -- matthew 9:17
.
While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. -- matthew 9:18
.
And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. -- matthew 9:19
.
And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: -- matthew 9:20
.
For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. -- matthew 9:21
.
But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. -- matthew 9:22
.
And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, -- matthew 9:23
.
He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. -- matthew 9:24
.
But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. -- matthew 9:25
.
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land. -- matthew 9:26
.
And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us. -- matthew 9:27
.
And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. -- matthew 9:28
.
Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. -- matthew 9:29
.
And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. -- matthew 9:30
.
But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country. -- matthew 9:31
.
As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. -- matthew 9:32
.
And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. -- matthew 9:33
.
But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils. -- matthew 9:34
.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. -- matthew 9:35
.
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. -- matthew 9:36
.
Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; -- matthew 9:37
.
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest. -- matthew 9:38
.
And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. -- matthew 10:1
.
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; -- matthew 10:2
.
Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; -- matthew 10:3
.
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. -- matthew 10:4
.
These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: -- matthew 10:5
.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. -- matthew 10:6
.
And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. -- matthew 10:7
.
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. -- matthew 10:8
.
Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, -- matthew 10:9
.
Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. -- matthew 10:10
.
And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. -- matthew 10:11
.
And when ye come into an house, salute it. -- matthew 10:12
.
And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. -- matthew 10:13
.
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. -- matthew 10:14
.
Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. -- matthew 10:15
.
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. -- matthew 10:16
.
But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; -- matthew 10:17
.
And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. -- matthew 10:18
.
But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. -- matthew 10:19
.
For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. -- matthew 10:20
.
And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. -- matthew 10:21
.
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. -- matthew 10:22
.
But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. -- matthew 10:23
.
The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. -- matthew 10:24
.
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? -- matthew 10:25
.
Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. -- matthew 10:26
.
What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. -- matthew 10:27
.
And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. -- matthew 10:28
.
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. -- matthew 10:29
.
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. -- matthew 10:30
.
Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. -- matthew 10:31
.
Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. -- matthew 10:32
.
But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. -- matthew 10:33
.
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. -- matthew 10:34
.
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. -- matthew 10:35
.
And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. -- matthew 10:36
.
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. -- matthew 10:37
.
And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. -- matthew 10:38
.
He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. -- matthew 10:39
.
He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. -- matthew 10:40
.
He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. -- matthew 10:41
.
And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. -- matthew 10:42
.
And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. -- matthew 11:1
.
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, -- matthew 11:2
.
And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? -- matthew 11:3
.
Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: -- matthew 11:4
.
The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. -- matthew 11:5
.
And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. -- matthew 11:6
.
And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? -- matthew 11:7
.
But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. -- matthew 11:8
.
But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. -- matthew 11:9
.
For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. -- matthew 11:10
.
Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. -- matthew 11:11
.
And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. -- matthew 11:12
.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. -- matthew 11:13
.
And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. -- matthew 11:14
.
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. -- matthew 11:15
.
But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, -- matthew 11:16
.
And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. -- matthew 11:17
.
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. -- matthew 11:18
.
The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. -- matthew 11:19
.
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: -- matthew 11:20
.
Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. -- matthew 11:21
.
But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. -- matthew 11:22
.
And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. -- matthew 11:23
.
But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. -- matthew 11:24
.
At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. -- matthew 11:25
.
Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. -- matthew 11:26
.
All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. -- matthew 11:27
.
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. -- matthew 11:28
.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. -- matthew 11:29
.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. -- matthew 11:30
.
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat. -- matthew 12:1
.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day. -- matthew 12:2
.
But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; -- matthew 12:3
.
How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? -- matthew 12:4
.
Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? -- matthew 12:5
.
But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple. -- matthew 12:6
.
But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. -- matthew 12:7
.
For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. -- matthew 12:8
.
And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: -- matthew 12:9
.
And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. -- matthew 12:10
.
And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? -- matthew 12:11
.
How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. -- matthew 12:12
.
Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. -- matthew 12:13
.
Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him. -- matthew 12:14
.
But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; -- matthew 12:15
.
And charged them that they should not make him known: -- matthew 12:16
.
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, -- matthew 12:17
.
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. -- matthew 12:18
.
He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. -- matthew 12:19
.
A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. -- matthew 12:20
.
And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. -- matthew 12:21
.
Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. -- matthew 12:22
.
And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? -- matthew 12:23
.
But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. -- matthew 12:24
.
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: -- matthew 12:25
.
And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? -- matthew 12:26
.
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. -- matthew 12:27
.
But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. -- matthew 12:28
.
Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. -- matthew 12:29
.
He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. -- matthew 12:30
.
Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. -- matthew 12:31
.
And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. -- matthew 12:32
.
Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. -- matthew 12:33
.
O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. -- matthew 12:34
.
A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. -- matthew 12:35
.
But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. -- matthew 12:36
.
For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. -- matthew 12:37
.
Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. -- matthew 12:38
.
But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: -- matthew 12:39
.
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. -- matthew 12:40
.
The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. -- matthew 12:41
.
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. -- matthew 12:42
.
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. -- matthew 12:43
.
Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. -- matthew 12:44
.
Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. -- matthew 12:45
.
While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. -- matthew 12:46
.
Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. -- matthew 12:47
.
But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? -- matthew 12:48
.
And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! -- matthew 12:49
.
For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. -- matthew 12:50
.
The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. -- matthew 13:1
.
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. -- matthew 13:2
.
And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow; -- matthew 13:3
.
And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: -- matthew 13:4
.
Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: -- matthew 13:5
.
And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. -- matthew 13:6
.
And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: -- matthew 13:7
.
But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. -- matthew 13:8
.
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. -- matthew 13:9
.
And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? -- matthew 13:10
.
He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. -- matthew 13:11
.
For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. -- matthew 13:12
.
Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. -- matthew 13:13
.
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: -- matthew 13:14
.
For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. -- matthew 13:15
.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. -- matthew 13:16
.
For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. -- matthew 13:17
.
Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. -- matthew 13:18
.
When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. -- matthew 13:19
.
But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; -- matthew 13:20
.
Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. -- matthew 13:21
.
He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. -- matthew 13:22
.
But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. -- matthew 13:23
.
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: -- matthew 13:24
.
But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. -- matthew 13:25
.
But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. -- matthew 13:26
.
So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? -- matthew 13:27
.
He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? -- matthew 13:28
.
But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. -- matthew 13:29
.
Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. -- matthew 13:30
.
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: -- matthew 13:31
.
Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. -- matthew 13:32
.
Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. -- matthew 13:33
.
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: -- matthew 13:34
.
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. -- matthew 13:35
.
Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. -- matthew 13:36
.
He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; -- matthew 13:37
.
The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; -- matthew 13:38
.
The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. -- matthew 13:39
.
As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. -- matthew 13:40
.
The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; -- matthew 13:41
.
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 13:42
.
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. -- matthew 13:43
.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. -- matthew 13:44
.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: -- matthew 13:45
.
Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. -- matthew 13:46
.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: -- matthew 13:47
.
Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. -- matthew 13:48
.
So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, -- matthew 13:49
.
And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 13:50
.
Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. -- matthew 13:51
.
Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. -- matthew 13:52
.
And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. -- matthew 13:53
.
And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? -- matthew 13:54
.
Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? -- matthew 13:55
.
And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? -- matthew 13:56
.
And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. -- matthew 13:57
.
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief. -- matthew 13:58
.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, -- matthew 14:1
.
And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. -- matthew 14:2
.
For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. -- matthew 14:3
.
For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. -- matthew 14:4
.
And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. -- matthew 14:5
.
But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. -- matthew 14:6
.
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. -- matthew 14:7
.
And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. -- matthew 14:8
.
And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. -- matthew 14:9
.
And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. -- matthew 14:10
.
And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. -- matthew 14:11
.
And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. -- matthew 14:12
.
When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. -- matthew 14:13
.
And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. -- matthew 14:14
.
And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. -- matthew 14:15
.
But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. -- matthew 14:16
.
And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. -- matthew 14:17
.
He said, Bring them hither to me. -- matthew 14:18
.
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. -- matthew 14:19
.
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. -- matthew 14:20
.
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. -- matthew 14:21
.
And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. -- matthew 14:22
.
And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. -- matthew 14:23
.
But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. -- matthew 14:24
.
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. -- matthew 14:25
.
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. -- matthew 14:26
.
But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. -- matthew 14:27
.
And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. -- matthew 14:28
.
And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. -- matthew 14:29
.
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. -- matthew 14:30
.
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? -- matthew 14:31
.
And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. -- matthew 14:32
.
Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. -- matthew 14:33
.
And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. -- matthew 14:34
.
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; -- matthew 14:35
.
And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole. -- matthew 14:36
.
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, -- matthew 15:1
.
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. -- matthew 15:2
.
But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? -- matthew 15:3
.
For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. -- matthew 15:4
.
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; -- matthew 15:5
.
And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. -- matthew 15:6
.
Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, -- matthew 15:7
.
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. -- matthew 15:8
.
But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. -- matthew 15:9
.
And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: -- matthew 15:10
.
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. -- matthew 15:11
.
Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? -- matthew 15:12
.
But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. -- matthew 15:13
.
Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. -- matthew 15:14
.
Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. -- matthew 15:15
.
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? -- matthew 15:16
.
Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? -- matthew 15:17
.
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. -- matthew 15:18
.
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: -- matthew 15:19
.
These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. -- matthew 15:20
.
Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. -- matthew 15:21
.
And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. -- matthew 15:22
.
But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. -- matthew 15:23
.
But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. -- matthew 15:24
.
Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. -- matthew 15:25
.
But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. -- matthew 15:26
.
And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. -- matthew 15:27
.
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. -- matthew 15:28
.
And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. -- matthew 15:29
.
And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: -- matthew 15:30
.
Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. -- matthew 15:31
.
Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. -- matthew 15:32
.
And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? -- matthew 15:33
.
And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. -- matthew 15:34
.
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. -- matthew 15:35
.
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. -- matthew 15:36
.
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. -- matthew 15:37
.
And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. -- matthew 15:38
.
And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. -- matthew 15:39
.
The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. -- matthew 16:1
.
He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. -- matthew 16:2
.
And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? -- matthew 16:3
.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. -- matthew 16:4
.
And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. -- matthew 16:5
.
Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. -- matthew 16:6
.
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. -- matthew 16:7
.
Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? -- matthew 16:8
.
Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? -- matthew 16:9
.
Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? -- matthew 16:10
.
How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? -- matthew 16:11
.
Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. -- matthew 16:12
.
When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? -- matthew 16:13
.
And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. -- matthew 16:14
.
He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? -- matthew 16:15
.
And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. -- matthew 16:16
.
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. -- matthew 16:17
.
And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. -- matthew 16:18
.
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. -- matthew 16:19
.
Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. -- matthew 16:20
.
From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. -- matthew 16:21
.
Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. -- matthew 16:22
.
But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. -- matthew 16:23
.
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. -- matthew 16:24
.
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. -- matthew 16:25
.
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? -- matthew 16:26
.
For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. -- matthew 16:27
.
Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. -- matthew 16:28
.
And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, -- matthew 17:1
.
And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. -- matthew 17:2
.
And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. -- matthew 17:3
.
Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. -- matthew 17:4
.
While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. -- matthew 17:5
.
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. -- matthew 17:6
.
And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. -- matthew 17:7
.
And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. -- matthew 17:8
.
And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. -- matthew 17:9
.
And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? -- matthew 17:10
.
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. -- matthew 17:11
.
But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. -- matthew 17:12
.
Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. -- matthew 17:13
.
And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, -- matthew 17:14
.
Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. -- matthew 17:15
.
And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. -- matthew 17:16
.
Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. -- matthew 17:17
.
And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. -- matthew 17:18
.
Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? -- matthew 17:19
.
And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. -- matthew 17:20
.
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. -- matthew 17:21
.
And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: -- matthew 17:22
.
And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry. -- matthew 17:23
.
And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? -- matthew 17:24
.
He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? -- matthew 17:25
.
Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. -- matthew 17:26
.
Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee. -- matthew 17:27
.
At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? -- matthew 18:1
.
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, -- matthew 18:2
.
And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 18:3
.
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 18:4
.
And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. -- matthew 18:5
.
But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. -- matthew 18:6
.
Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! -- matthew 18:7
.
Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. -- matthew 18:8
.
And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. -- matthew 18:9
.
Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. -- matthew 18:10
.
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. -- matthew 18:11
.
How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? -- matthew 18:12
.
And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. -- matthew 18:13
.
Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. -- matthew 18:14
.
Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. -- matthew 18:15
.
But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. -- matthew 18:16
.
And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. -- matthew 18:17
.
Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. -- matthew 18:18
.
Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. -- matthew 18:19
.
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- matthew 18:20
.
Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? -- matthew 18:21
.
Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. -- matthew 18:22
.
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. -- matthew 18:23
.
And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. -- matthew 18:24
.
But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. -- matthew 18:25
.
The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. -- matthew 18:26
.
Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. -- matthew 18:27
.
But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. -- matthew 18:28
.
And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. -- matthew 18:29
.
And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. -- matthew 18:30
.
So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. -- matthew 18:31
.
Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: -- matthew 18:32
.
Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? -- matthew 18:33
.
And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. -- matthew 18:34
.
So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. -- matthew 18:35
.
And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; -- matthew 19:1
.
And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. -- matthew 19:2
.
The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? -- matthew 19:3
.
And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, -- matthew 19:4
.
And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? -- matthew 19:5
.
Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. -- matthew 19:6
.
They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? -- matthew 19:7
.
He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. -- matthew 19:8
.
And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. -- matthew 19:9
.
His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. -- matthew 19:10
.
But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. -- matthew 19:11
.
For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. -- matthew 19:12
.
Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. -- matthew 19:13
.
But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 19:14
.
And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence. -- matthew 19:15
.
And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? -- matthew 19:16
.
And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. -- matthew 19:17
.
He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, -- matthew 19:18
.
Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. -- matthew 19:19
.
The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? -- matthew 19:20
.
Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. -- matthew 19:21
.
But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. -- matthew 19:22
.
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 19:23
.
And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. -- matthew 19:24
.
When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? -- matthew 19:25
.
But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. -- matthew 19:26
.
Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? -- matthew 19:27
.
And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. -- matthew 19:28
.
And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. -- matthew 19:29
.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first. -- matthew 19:30
.
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. -- matthew 20:1
.
And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. -- matthew 20:2
.
And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, -- matthew 20:3
.
And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. -- matthew 20:4
.
Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. -- matthew 20:5
.
And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? -- matthew 20:6
.
They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. -- matthew 20:7
.
So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. -- matthew 20:8
.
And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. -- matthew 20:9
.
But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. -- matthew 20:10
.
And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, -- matthew 20:11
.
Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. -- matthew 20:12
.
But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? -- matthew 20:13
.
Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. -- matthew 20:14
.
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? -- matthew 20:15
.
So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. -- matthew 20:16
.
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, -- matthew 20:17
.
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, -- matthew 20:18
.
And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again. -- matthew 20:19
.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. -- matthew 20:20
.
And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. -- matthew 20:21
.
But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. -- matthew 20:22
.
And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. -- matthew 20:23
.
And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. -- matthew 20:24
.
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. -- matthew 20:25
.
But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; -- matthew 20:26
.
And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: -- matthew 20:27
.
Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. -- matthew 20:28
.
And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. -- matthew 20:29
.
And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. -- matthew 20:30
.
And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. -- matthew 20:31
.
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? -- matthew 20:32
.
They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. -- matthew 20:33
.
So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him. -- matthew 20:34
.
And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, -- matthew 21:1
.
Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. -- matthew 21:2
.
And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them. -- matthew 21:3
.
All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, -- matthew 21:4
.
Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass. -- matthew 21:5
.
And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, -- matthew 21:6
.
And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. -- matthew 21:7
.
And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. -- matthew 21:8
.
And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. -- matthew 21:9
.
And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? -- matthew 21:10
.
And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. -- matthew 21:11
.
And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, -- matthew 21:12
.
And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. -- matthew 21:13
.
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. -- matthew 21:14
.
And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased, -- matthew 21:15
.
And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? -- matthew 21:16
.
And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there. -- matthew 21:17
.
Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. -- matthew 21:18
.
And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. -- matthew 21:19
.
And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away! -- matthew 21:20
.
Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. -- matthew 21:21
.
And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. -- matthew 21:22
.
And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? -- matthew 21:23
.
And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. -- matthew 21:24
.
The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? -- matthew 21:25
.
But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. -- matthew 21:26
.
And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. -- matthew 21:27
.
But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. -- matthew 21:28
.
He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. -- matthew 21:29
.
And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. -- matthew 21:30
.
Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. -- matthew 21:31
.
For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. -- matthew 21:32
.
Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: -- matthew 21:33
.
And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. -- matthew 21:34
.
And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. -- matthew 21:35
.
Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. -- matthew 21:36
.
But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. -- matthew 21:37
.
But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. -- matthew 21:38
.
And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. -- matthew 21:39
.
When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? -- matthew 21:40
.
They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. -- matthew 21:41
.
Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? -- matthew 21:42
.
Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. -- matthew 21:43
.
And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. -- matthew 21:44
.
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. -- matthew 21:45
.
But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet. -- matthew 21:46
.
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, -- matthew 22:1
.
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, -- matthew 22:2
.
And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. -- matthew 22:3
.
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. -- matthew 22:4
.
But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: -- matthew 22:5
.
And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. -- matthew 22:6
.
But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. -- matthew 22:7
.
Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. -- matthew 22:8
.
Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. -- matthew 22:9
.
So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. -- matthew 22:10
.
And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: -- matthew 22:11
.
And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. -- matthew 22:12
.
Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 22:13
.
For many are called, but few are chosen. -- matthew 22:14
.
Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. -- matthew 22:15
.
And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. -- matthew 22:16
.
Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? -- matthew 22:17
.
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? -- matthew 22:18
.
Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. -- matthew 22:19
.
And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? -- matthew 22:20
.
They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. -- matthew 22:21
.
When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way. -- matthew 22:22
.
The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him, -- matthew 22:23
.
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. -- matthew 22:24
.
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: -- matthew 22:25
.
Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. -- matthew 22:26
.
And last of all the woman died also. -- matthew 22:27
.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her. -- matthew 22:28
.
Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. -- matthew 22:29
.
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. -- matthew 22:30
.
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, -- matthew 22:31
.
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. -- matthew 22:32
.
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. -- matthew 22:33
.
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. -- matthew 22:34
.
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, -- matthew 22:35
.
Master, which is the great commandment in the law? -- matthew 22:36
.
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. -- matthew 22:37
.
This is the first and great commandment. -- matthew 22:38
.
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. -- matthew 22:39
.
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. -- matthew 22:40
.
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, -- matthew 22:41
.
Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. -- matthew 22:42
.
He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, -- matthew 22:43
.
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? -- matthew 22:44
.
If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? -- matthew 22:45
.
And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. -- matthew 22:46
.
Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, -- matthew 23:1
.
Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: -- matthew 23:2
.
All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. -- matthew 23:3
.
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. -- matthew 23:4
.
But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, -- matthew 23:5
.
And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, -- matthew 23:6
.
And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. -- matthew 23:7
.
But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. -- matthew 23:8
.
And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. -- matthew 23:9
.
Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. -- matthew 23:10
.
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. -- matthew 23:11
.
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted. -- matthew 23:12
.
But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. -- matthew 23:13
.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. -- matthew 23:14
.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. -- matthew 23:15
.
Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! -- matthew 23:16
.
Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? -- matthew 23:17
.
And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. -- matthew 23:18
.
Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? -- matthew 23:19
.
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. -- matthew 23:20
.
And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. -- matthew 23:21
.
And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. -- matthew 23:22
.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. -- matthew 23:23
.
Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. -- matthew 23:24
.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. -- matthew 23:25
.
Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. -- matthew 23:26
.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. -- matthew 23:27
.
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. -- matthew 23:28
.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, -- matthew 23:29
.
And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. -- matthew 23:30
.
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. -- matthew 23:31
.
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. -- matthew 23:32
.
Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? -- matthew 23:33
.
Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: -- matthew 23:34
.
That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. -- matthew 23:35
.
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. -- matthew 23:36
.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! -- matthew 23:37
.
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. -- matthew 23:38
.
For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. -- matthew 23:39
.
And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. -- matthew 24:1
.
And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. -- matthew 24:2
.
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? -- matthew 24:3
.
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. -- matthew 24:4
.
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. -- matthew 24:5
.
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. -- matthew 24:6
.
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. -- matthew 24:7
.
All these are the beginning of sorrows. -- matthew 24:8
.
Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. -- matthew 24:9
.
And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. -- matthew 24:10
.
And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. -- matthew 24:11
.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. -- matthew 24:12
.
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. -- matthew 24:13
.
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. -- matthew 24:14
.
When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) -- matthew 24:15
.
Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains: -- matthew 24:16
.
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: -- matthew 24:17
.
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. -- matthew 24:18
.
And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! -- matthew 24:19
.
But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: -- matthew 24:20
.
For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. -- matthew 24:21
.
And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. -- matthew 24:22
.
Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. -- matthew 24:23
.
For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. -- matthew 24:24
.
Behold, I have told you before. -- matthew 24:25
.
Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. -- matthew 24:26
.
For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. -- matthew 24:27
.
For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. -- matthew 24:28
.
Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: -- matthew 24:29
.
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. -- matthew 24:30
.
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. -- matthew 24:31
.
Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: -- matthew 24:32
.
So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. -- matthew 24:33
.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. -- matthew 24:34
.
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. -- matthew 24:35
.
But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. -- matthew 24:36
.
But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. -- matthew 24:37
.
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, -- matthew 24:38
.
And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. -- matthew 24:39
.
Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. -- matthew 24:40
.
Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. -- matthew 24:41
.
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. -- matthew 24:42
.
But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. -- matthew 24:43
.
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. -- matthew 24:44
.
Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? -- matthew 24:45
.
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. -- matthew 24:46
.
Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. -- matthew 24:47
.
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; -- matthew 24:48
.
And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; -- matthew 24:49
.
The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, -- matthew 24:50
.
And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 24:51
.
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. -- matthew 25:1
.
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. -- matthew 25:2
.
They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: -- matthew 25:3
.
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. -- matthew 25:4
.
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. -- matthew 25:5
.
And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. -- matthew 25:6
.
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. -- matthew 25:7
.
And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. -- matthew 25:8
.
But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. -- matthew 25:9
.
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. -- matthew 25:10
.
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. -- matthew 25:11
.
But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. -- matthew 25:12
.
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. -- matthew 25:13
.
For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. -- matthew 25:14
.
And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. -- matthew 25:15
.
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. -- matthew 25:16
.
And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. -- matthew 25:17
.
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. -- matthew 25:18
.
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. -- matthew 25:19
.
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. -- matthew 25:20
.
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. -- matthew 25:21
.
He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. -- matthew 25:22
.
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. -- matthew 25:23
.
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: -- matthew 25:24
.
And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. -- matthew 25:25
.
His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: -- matthew 25:26
.
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. -- matthew 25:27
.
Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. -- matthew 25:28
.
For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. -- matthew 25:29
.
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 25:30
.
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: -- matthew 25:31
.
And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: -- matthew 25:32
.
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. -- matthew 25:33
.
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: -- matthew 25:34
.
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: -- matthew 25:35
.
Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. -- matthew 25:36
.
Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? -- matthew 25:37
.
When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? -- matthew 25:38
.
Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? -- matthew 25:39
.
And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. -- matthew 25:40
.
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: -- matthew 25:41
.
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: -- matthew 25:42
.
I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. -- matthew 25:43
.
Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? -- matthew 25:44
.
Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. -- matthew 25:45
.
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. -- matthew 25:46
.
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, -- matthew 26:1
.
Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. -- matthew 26:2
.
Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, -- matthew 26:3
.
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. -- matthew 26:4
.
But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. -- matthew 26:5
.
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, -- matthew 26:6
.
There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. -- matthew 26:7
.
But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? -- matthew 26:8
.
For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. -- matthew 26:9
.
When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. -- matthew 26:10
.
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. -- matthew 26:11
.
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. -- matthew 26:12
.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. -- matthew 26:13
.
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, -- matthew 26:14
.
And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. -- matthew 26:15
.
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. -- matthew 26:16
.
Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? -- matthew 26:17
.
And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. -- matthew 26:18
.
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. -- matthew 26:19
.
Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. -- matthew 26:20
.
And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. -- matthew 26:21
.
And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? -- matthew 26:22
.
And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. -- matthew 26:23
.
The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. -- matthew 26:24
.
Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. -- matthew 26:25
.
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. -- matthew 26:26
.
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; -- matthew 26:27
.
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. -- matthew 26:28
.
But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. -- matthew 26:29
.
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. -- matthew 26:30
.
Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. -- matthew 26:31
.
But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. -- matthew 26:32
.
Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. -- matthew 26:33
.
Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. -- matthew 26:34
.
Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. -- matthew 26:35
.
Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. -- matthew 26:36
.
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. -- matthew 26:37
.
Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. -- matthew 26:38
.
And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. -- matthew 26:39
.
And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? -- matthew 26:40
.
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. -- matthew 26:41
.
He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. -- matthew 26:42
.
And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. -- matthew 26:43
.
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. -- matthew 26:44
.
Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. -- matthew 26:45
.
Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. -- matthew 26:46
.
And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. -- matthew 26:47
.
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. -- matthew 26:48
.
And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. -- matthew 26:49
.
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. -- matthew 26:50
.
And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. -- matthew 26:51
.
Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. -- matthew 26:52
.
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? -- matthew 26:53
.
But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? -- matthew 26:54
.
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. -- matthew 26:55
.
But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. -- matthew 26:56
.
And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. -- matthew 26:57
.
But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. -- matthew 26:58
.
Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; -- matthew 26:59
.
But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, -- matthew 26:60
.
And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. -- matthew 26:61
.
And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? -- matthew 26:62
.
But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. -- matthew 26:63
.
Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. -- matthew 26:64
.
Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. -- matthew 26:65
.
What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. -- matthew 26:66
.
Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, -- matthew 26:67
.
Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? -- matthew 26:68
.
Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. -- matthew 26:69
.
But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. -- matthew 26:70
.
And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. -- matthew 26:71
.
And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. -- matthew 26:72
.
And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. -- matthew 26:73
.
Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. -- matthew 26:74
.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. -- matthew 26:75
.
When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: -- matthew 27:1
.
And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. -- matthew 27:2
.
Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, -- matthew 27:3
.
Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. -- matthew 27:4
.
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. -- matthew 27:5
.
And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. -- matthew 27:6
.
And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. -- matthew 27:7
.
Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. -- matthew 27:8
.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; -- matthew 27:9
.
And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me. -- matthew 27:10
.
And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. -- matthew 27:11
.
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. -- matthew 27:12
.
Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? -- matthew 27:13
.
And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. -- matthew 27:14
.
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. -- matthew 27:15
.
And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. -- matthew 27:16
.
Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? -- matthew 27:17
.
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. -- matthew 27:18
.
When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. -- matthew 27:19
.
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. -- matthew 27:20
.
The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. -- matthew 27:21
.
Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. -- matthew 27:22
.
And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. -- matthew 27:23
.
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. -- matthew 27:24
.
Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. -- matthew 27:25
.
Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. -- matthew 27:26
.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. -- matthew 27:27
.
And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. -- matthew 27:28
.
And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! -- matthew 27:29
.
And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. -- matthew 27:30
.
And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. -- matthew 27:31
.
And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. -- matthew 27:32
.
And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, -- matthew 27:33
.
They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. -- matthew 27:34
.
And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. -- matthew 27:35
.
And sitting down they watched him there; -- matthew 27:36
.
And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. -- matthew 27:37
.
Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. -- matthew 27:38
.
And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, -- matthew 27:39
.
And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. -- matthew 27:40
.
Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, -- matthew 27:41
.
He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. -- matthew 27:42
.
He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. -- matthew 27:43
.
The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. -- matthew 27:44
.
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. -- matthew 27:45
.
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? -- matthew 27:46
.
Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. -- matthew 27:47
.
And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. -- matthew 27:48
.
The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. -- matthew 27:49
.
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. -- matthew 27:50
.
And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; -- matthew 27:51
.
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, -- matthew 27:52
.
And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. -- matthew 27:53
.
Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. -- matthew 27:54
.
And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: -- matthew 27:55
.
Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children. -- matthew 27:56
.
When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: -- matthew 27:57
.
He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. -- matthew 27:58
.
And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, -- matthew 27:59
.
And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. -- matthew 27:60
.
And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. -- matthew 27:61
.
Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, -- matthew 27:62
.
Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. -- matthew 27:63
.
Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. -- matthew 27:64
.
Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. -- matthew 27:65
.
So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch. -- matthew 27:66
.
In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. -- matthew 28:1
.
And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. -- matthew 28:2
.
His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: -- matthew 28:3
.
And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. -- matthew 28:4
.
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. -- matthew 28:5
.
He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. -- matthew 28:6
.
And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. -- matthew 28:7
.
And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. -- matthew 28:8
.
And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. -- matthew 28:9
.
Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. -- matthew 28:10
.
Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. -- matthew 28:11
.
And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, -- matthew 28:12
.
Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. -- matthew 28:13
.
And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. -- matthew 28:14
.
So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. -- matthew 28:15
.
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. -- matthew 28:16
.
And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. -- matthew 28:17
.
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. -- matthew 28:18
.
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: -- matthew 28:19
.
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. -- matthew 28:20
.
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; -- mark 1:1
.
As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. -- mark 1:2
.
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. -- mark 1:3
.
John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. -- mark 1:4
.
And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. -- mark 1:5
.
And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; -- mark 1:6
.
And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. -- mark 1:7
.
I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. -- mark 1:8
.
And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. -- mark 1:9
.
And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: -- mark 1:10
.
And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- mark 1:11
.
And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness. -- mark 1:12
.
And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. -- mark 1:13
.
Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, -- mark 1:14
.
And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. -- mark 1:15
.
Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. -- mark 1:16
.
And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. -- mark 1:17
.
And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. -- mark 1:18
.
And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. -- mark 1:19
.
And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. -- mark 1:20
.
And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. -- mark 1:21
.
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. -- mark 1:22
.
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, -- mark 1:23
.
Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. -- mark 1:24
.
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. -- mark 1:25
.
And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. -- mark 1:26
.
And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. -- mark 1:27
.
And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. -- mark 1:28
.
And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. -- mark 1:29
.
But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. -- mark 1:30
.
And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. -- mark 1:31
.
And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. -- mark 1:32
.
And all the city was gathered together at the door. -- mark 1:33
.
And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. -- mark 1:34
.
And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. -- mark 1:35
.
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. -- mark 1:36
.
And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee. -- mark 1:37
.
And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. -- mark 1:38
.
And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. -- mark 1:39
.
And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. -- mark 1:40
.
And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. -- mark 1:41
.
And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. -- mark 1:42
.
And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; -- mark 1:43
.
And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. -- mark 1:44
.
But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter. -- mark 1:45
.
And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. -- mark 2:1
.
And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. -- mark 2:2
.
And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. -- mark 2:3
.
And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. -- mark 2:4
.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. -- mark 2:5
.
But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, -- mark 2:6
.
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? -- mark 2:7
.
And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? -- mark 2:8
.
Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? -- mark 2:9
.
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) -- mark 2:10
.
I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. -- mark 2:11
.
And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. -- mark 2:12
.
And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. -- mark 2:13
.
And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. -- mark 2:14
.
And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. -- mark 2:15
.
And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? -- mark 2:16
.
When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. -- mark 2:17
.
And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? -- mark 2:18
.
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. -- mark 2:19
.
But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. -- mark 2:20
.
No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. -- mark 2:21
.
And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles. -- mark 2:22
.
And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. -- mark 2:23
.
And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? -- mark 2:24
.
And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? -- mark 2:25
.
How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? -- mark 2:26
.
And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: -- mark 2:27
.
Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. -- mark 2:28
.
And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand. -- mark 3:1
.
And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. -- mark 3:2
.
And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth. -- mark 3:3
.
And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace. -- mark 3:4
.
And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other. -- mark 3:5
.
And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. -- mark 3:6
.
But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, -- mark 3:7
.
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him. -- mark 3:8
.
And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. -- mark 3:9
.
For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues. -- mark 3:10
.
And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. -- mark 3:11
.
And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known. -- mark 3:12
.
And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him. -- mark 3:13
.
And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, -- mark 3:14
.
And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils: -- mark 3:15
.
And Simon he surnamed Peter; -- mark 3:16
.
And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder: -- mark 3:17
.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite, -- mark 3:18
.
And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house. -- mark 3:19
.
And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. -- mark 3:20
.
And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself. -- mark 3:21
.
And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. -- mark 3:22
.
And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? -- mark 3:23
.
And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. -- mark 3:24
.
And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. -- mark 3:25
.
And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. -- mark 3:26
.
No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. -- mark 3:27
.
Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: -- mark 3:28
.
But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation. -- mark 3:29
.
Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. -- mark 3:30
.
There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him. -- mark 3:31
.
And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. -- mark 3:32
.
And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren? -- mark 3:33
.
And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! -- mark 3:34
.
For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother. -- mark 3:35
.
And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. -- mark 4:1
.
And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, -- mark 4:2
.
Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: -- mark 4:3
.
And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. -- mark 4:4
.
And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: -- mark 4:5
.
But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. -- mark 4:6
.
And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. -- mark 4:7
.
And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. -- mark 4:8
.
And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. -- mark 4:9
.
And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. -- mark 4:10
.
And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: -- mark 4:11
.
That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. -- mark 4:12
.
And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? -- mark 4:13
.
The sower soweth the word. -- mark 4:14
.
And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. -- mark 4:15
.
And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; -- mark 4:16
.
And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. -- mark 4:17
.
And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, -- mark 4:18
.
And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. -- mark 4:19
.
And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred. -- mark 4:20
.
And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? -- mark 4:21
.
For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. -- mark 4:22
.
If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. -- mark 4:23
.
And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. -- mark 4:24
.
For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. -- mark 4:25
.
And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; -- mark 4:26
.
And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. -- mark 4:27
.
For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. -- mark 4:28
.
But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. -- mark 4:29
.
And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? -- mark 4:30
.
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: -- mark 4:31
.
But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. -- mark 4:32
.
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. -- mark 4:33
.
But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples. -- mark 4:34
.
And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. -- mark 4:35
.
And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. -- mark 4:36
.
And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. -- mark 4:37
.
And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? -- mark 4:38
.
And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. -- mark 4:39
.
And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? -- mark 4:40
.
And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? -- mark 4:41
.
And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. -- mark 5:1
.
And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, -- mark 5:2
.
Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: -- mark 5:3
.
Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. -- mark 5:4
.
And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. -- mark 5:5
.
But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, -- mark 5:6
.
And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. -- mark 5:7
.
For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. -- mark 5:8
.
And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. -- mark 5:9
.
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. -- mark 5:10
.
Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. -- mark 5:11
.
And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. -- mark 5:12
.
And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. -- mark 5:13
.
And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. -- mark 5:14
.
And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. -- mark 5:15
.
And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. -- mark 5:16
.
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. -- mark 5:17
.
And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. -- mark 5:18
.
Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. -- mark 5:19
.
And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel. -- mark 5:20
.
And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea. -- mark 5:21
.
And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, -- mark 5:22
.
And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live. -- mark 5:23
.
And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him. -- mark 5:24
.
And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, -- mark 5:25
.
And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, -- mark 5:26
.
When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. -- mark 5:27
.
For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. -- mark 5:28
.
And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. -- mark 5:29
.
And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes? -- mark 5:30
.
And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? -- mark 5:31
.
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. -- mark 5:32
.
But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. -- mark 5:33
.
And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. -- mark 5:34
.
While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? -- mark 5:35
.
As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. -- mark 5:36
.
And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. -- mark 5:37
.
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. -- mark 5:38
.
And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. -- mark 5:39
.
And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. -- mark 5:40
.
And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. -- mark 5:41
.
And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. -- mark 5:42
.
And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat. -- mark 5:43
.
And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him. -- mark 6:1
.
And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? -- mark 6:2
.
Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. -- mark 6:3
.
But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. -- mark 6:4
.
And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. -- mark 6:5
.
And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching. -- mark 6:6
.
And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; -- mark 6:7
.
And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse: -- mark 6:8
.
But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats. -- mark 6:9
.
And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place. -- mark 6:10
.
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. -- mark 6:11
.
And they went out, and preached that men should repent. -- mark 6:12
.
And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. -- mark 6:13
.
And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. -- mark 6:14
.
Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. -- mark 6:15
.
But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead. -- mark 6:16
.
For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her. -- mark 6:17
.
For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. -- mark 6:18
.
Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: -- mark 6:19
.
For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. -- mark 6:20
.
And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; -- mark 6:21
.
And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. -- mark 6:22
.
And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. -- mark 6:23
.
And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. -- mark 6:24
.
And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. -- mark 6:25
.
And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. -- mark 6:26
.
And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, -- mark 6:27
.
And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. -- mark 6:28
.
And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb. -- mark 6:29
.
And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. -- mark 6:30
.
And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. -- mark 6:31
.
And they departed into a desert place by ship privately. -- mark 6:32
.
And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him. -- mark 6:33
.
And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. -- mark 6:34
.
And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed: -- mark 6:35
.
Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat. -- mark 6:36
.
He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? -- mark 6:37
.
He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. -- mark 6:38
.
And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass. -- mark 6:39
.
And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. -- mark 6:40
.
And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all. -- mark 6:41
.
And they did all eat, and were filled. -- mark 6:42
.
And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes. -- mark 6:43
.
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men. -- mark 6:44
.
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. -- mark 6:45
.
And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray. -- mark 6:46
.
And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. -- mark 6:47
.
And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. -- mark 6:48
.
But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out: -- mark 6:49
.
For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. -- mark 6:50
.
And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered. -- mark 6:51
.
For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened. -- mark 6:52
.
And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. -- mark 6:53
.
And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him, -- mark 6:54
.
And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. -- mark 6:55
.
And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole. -- mark 6:56
.
Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. -- mark 7:1
.
And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. -- mark 7:2
.
For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. -- mark 7:3
.
And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. -- mark 7:4
.
Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? -- mark 7:5
.
He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. -- mark 7:6
.
Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. -- mark 7:7
.
For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. -- mark 7:8
.
And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. -- mark 7:9
.
For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: -- mark 7:10
.
But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free. -- mark 7:11
.
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother; -- mark 7:12
.
Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. -- mark 7:13
.
And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: -- mark 7:14
.
There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. -- mark 7:15
.
If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. -- mark 7:16
.
And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. -- mark 7:17
.
And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; -- mark 7:18
.
Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? -- mark 7:19
.
And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. -- mark 7:20
.
For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, -- mark 7:21
.
Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: -- mark 7:22
.
All these evil things come from within, and defile the man. -- mark 7:23
.
And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid. -- mark 7:24
.
For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: -- mark 7:25
.
The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. -- mark 7:26
.
But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. -- mark 7:27
.
And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. -- mark 7:28
.
And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. -- mark 7:29
.
And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. -- mark 7:30
.
And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. -- mark 7:31
.
And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. -- mark 7:32
.
And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; -- mark 7:33
.
And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. -- mark 7:34
.
And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. -- mark 7:35
.
And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; -- mark 7:36
.
And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. -- mark 7:37
.
In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, -- mark 8:1
.
I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: -- mark 8:2
.
And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far. -- mark 8:3
.
And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness? -- mark 8:4
.
And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. -- mark 8:5
.
And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people. -- mark 8:6
.
And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them. -- mark 8:7
.
So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets. -- mark 8:8
.
And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. -- mark 8:9
.
And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. -- mark 8:10
.
And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. -- mark 8:11
.
And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation. -- mark 8:12
.
And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side. -- mark 8:13
.
Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. -- mark 8:14
.
And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod. -- mark 8:15
.
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread. -- mark 8:16
.
And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened? -- mark 8:17
.
Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? -- mark 8:18
.
When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. -- mark 8:19
.
And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. -- mark 8:20
.
And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand? -- mark 8:21
.
And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. -- mark 8:22
.
And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. -- mark 8:23
.
And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. -- mark 8:24
.
After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. -- mark 8:25
.
And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town. -- mark 8:26
.
And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? -- mark 8:27
.
And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets. -- mark 8:28
.
And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. -- mark 8:29
.
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. -- mark 8:30
.
And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. -- mark 8:31
.
And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. -- mark 8:32
.
But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men. -- mark 8:33
.
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. -- mark 8:34
.
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. -- mark 8:35
.
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? -- mark 8:36
.
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? -- mark 8:37
.
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. -- mark 8:38
.
And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power. -- mark 9:1
.
And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them. -- mark 9:2
.
And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. -- mark 9:3
.
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. -- mark 9:4
.
And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. -- mark 9:5
.
For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid. -- mark 9:6
.
And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. -- mark 9:7
.
And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves. -- mark 9:8
.
And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. -- mark 9:9
.
And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean. -- mark 9:10
.
And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come? -- mark 9:11
.
And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. -- mark 9:12
.
But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him. -- mark 9:13
.
And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them. -- mark 9:14
.
And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. -- mark 9:15
.
And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? -- mark 9:16
.
And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; -- mark 9:17
.
And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not. -- mark 9:18
.
He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me. -- mark 9:19
.
And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. -- mark 9:20
.
And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child. -- mark 9:21
.
And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. -- mark 9:22
.
Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. -- mark 9:23
.
And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. -- mark 9:24
.
When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. -- mark 9:25
.
And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead. -- mark 9:26
.
But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose. -- mark 9:27
.
And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out? -- mark 9:28
.
And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting. -- mark 9:29
.
And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it. -- mark 9:30
.
For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day. -- mark 9:31
.
But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him. -- mark 9:32
.
And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way? -- mark 9:33
.
But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest. -- mark 9:34
.
And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all. -- mark 9:35
.
And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, -- mark 9:36
.
Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me. -- mark 9:37
.
And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us. -- mark 9:38
.
But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. -- mark 9:39
.
For he that is not against us is on our part. -- mark 9:40
.
For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. -- mark 9:41
.
And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. -- mark 9:42
.
And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: -- mark 9:43
.
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. -- mark 9:44
.
And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: -- mark 9:45
.
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. -- mark 9:46
.
And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: -- mark 9:47
.
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. -- mark 9:48
.
For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. -- mark 9:49
.
Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. -- mark 9:50
.
And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again. -- mark 10:1
.
And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him. -- mark 10:2
.
And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you? -- mark 10:3
.
And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. -- mark 10:4
.
And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. -- mark 10:5
.
But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. -- mark 10:6
.
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; -- mark 10:7
.
And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. -- mark 10:8
.
What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. -- mark 10:9
.
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter. -- mark 10:10
.
And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. -- mark 10:11
.
And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery. -- mark 10:12
.
And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. -- mark 10:13
.
But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. -- mark 10:14
.
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. -- mark 10:15
.
And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. -- mark 10:16
.
And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? -- mark 10:17
.
And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God. -- mark 10:18
.
Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. -- mark 10:19
.
And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. -- mark 10:20
.
Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me. -- mark 10:21
.
And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions. -- mark 10:22
.
And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! -- mark 10:23
.
And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! -- mark 10:24
.
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. -- mark 10:25
.
And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? -- mark 10:26
.
And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible. -- mark 10:27
.
Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. -- mark 10:28
.
And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, -- mark 10:29
.
But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. -- mark 10:30
.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. -- mark 10:31
.
And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him, -- mark 10:32
.
Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles: -- mark 10:33
.
And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. -- mark 10:34
.
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. -- mark 10:35
.
And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you? -- mark 10:36
.
They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. -- mark 10:37
.
But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? -- mark 10:38
.
And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: -- mark 10:39
.
But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. -- mark 10:40
.
And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. -- mark 10:41
.
But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. -- mark 10:42
.
But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: -- mark 10:43
.
And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. -- mark 10:44
.
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. -- mark 10:45
.
And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. -- mark 10:46
.
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. -- mark 10:47
.
And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. -- mark 10:48
.
And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. -- mark 10:49
.
And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. -- mark 10:50
.
And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. -- mark 10:51
.
And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way. -- mark 10:52
.
And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, -- mark 11:1
.
And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him. -- mark 11:2
.
And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. -- mark 11:3
.
And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him. -- mark 11:4
.
And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? -- mark 11:5
.
And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go. -- mark 11:6
.
And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him. -- mark 11:7
.
And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way. -- mark 11:8
.
And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: -- mark 11:9
.
Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest. -- mark 11:10
.
And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. -- mark 11:11
.
And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry: -- mark 11:12
.
And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. -- mark 11:13
.
And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it. -- mark 11:14
.
And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; -- mark 11:15
.
And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple. -- mark 11:16
.
And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. -- mark 11:17
.
And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine. -- mark 11:18
.
And when even was come, he went out of the city. -- mark 11:19
.
And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. -- mark 11:20
.
And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. -- mark 11:21
.
And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. -- mark 11:22
.
For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. -- mark 11:23
.
Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. -- mark 11:24
.
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. -- mark 11:25
.
But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. -- mark 11:26
.
And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, -- mark 11:27
.
And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things? -- mark 11:28
.
And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. -- mark 11:29
.
The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me. -- mark 11:30
.
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? -- mark 11:31
.
But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed. -- mark 11:32
.
And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. -- mark 11:33
.
And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. -- mark 12:1
.
And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. -- mark 12:2
.
And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. -- mark 12:3
.
And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled. -- mark 12:4
.
And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. -- mark 12:5
.
Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. -- mark 12:6
.
But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's. -- mark 12:7
.
And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. -- mark 12:8
.
What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. -- mark 12:9
.
And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: -- mark 12:10
.
This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? -- mark 12:11
.
And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way. -- mark 12:12
.
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words. -- mark 12:13
.
And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? -- mark 12:14
.
Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. -- mark 12:15
.
And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. -- mark 12:16
.
And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him. -- mark 12:17
.
Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, -- mark 12:18
.
Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. -- mark 12:19
.
Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. -- mark 12:20
.
And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. -- mark 12:21
.
And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. -- mark 12:22
.
In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. -- mark 12:23
.
And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? -- mark 12:24
.
For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. -- mark 12:25
.
And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? -- mark 12:26
.
He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. -- mark 12:27
.
And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? -- mark 12:28
.
And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: -- mark 12:29
.
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. -- mark 12:30
.
And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. -- mark 12:31
.
And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: -- mark 12:32
.
And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. -- mark 12:33
.
And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question. -- mark 12:34
.
And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? -- mark 12:35
.
For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. -- mark 12:36
.
David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly. -- mark 12:37
.
And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, -- mark 12:38
.
And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: -- mark 12:39
.
Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. -- mark 12:40
.
And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. -- mark 12:41
.
And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. -- mark 12:42
.
And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: -- mark 12:43
.
For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living. -- mark 12:44
.
And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! -- mark 13:1
.
And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. -- mark 13:2
.
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, -- mark 13:3
.
Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled? -- mark 13:4
.
And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you: -- mark 13:5
.
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. -- mark 13:6
.
And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet. -- mark 13:7
.
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows. -- mark 13:8
.
But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. -- mark 13:9
.
And the gospel must first be published among all nations. -- mark 13:10
.
But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. -- mark 13:11
.
Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death. -- mark 13:12
.
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. -- mark 13:13
.
But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains: -- mark 13:14
.
And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house: -- mark 13:15
.
And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment. -- mark 13:16
.
But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! -- mark 13:17
.
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. -- mark 13:18
.
For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be. -- mark 13:19
.
And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. -- mark 13:20
.
And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not: -- mark 13:21
.
For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. -- mark 13:22
.
But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. -- mark 13:23
.
But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, -- mark 13:24
.
And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. -- mark 13:25
.
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. -- mark 13:26
.
And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. -- mark 13:27
.
Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: -- mark 13:28
.
So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors. -- mark 13:29
.
Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. -- mark 13:30
.
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. -- mark 13:31
.
But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. -- mark 13:32
.
Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. -- mark 13:33
.
For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. -- mark 13:34
.
Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: -- mark 13:35
.
Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. -- mark 13:36
.
And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. -- mark 13:37
.
After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death. -- mark 14:1
.
But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people. -- mark 14:2
.
And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head. -- mark 14:3
.
And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? -- mark 14:4
.
For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. -- mark 14:5
.
And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. -- mark 14:6
.
For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. -- mark 14:7
.
She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. -- mark 14:8
.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. -- mark 14:9
.
And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them. -- mark 14:10
.
And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. -- mark 14:11
.
And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover? -- mark 14:12
.
And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him. -- mark 14:13
.
And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? -- mark 14:14
.
And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us. -- mark 14:15
.
And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. -- mark 14:16
.
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. -- mark 14:17
.
And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. -- mark 14:18
.
And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I? -- mark 14:19
.
And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish. -- mark 14:20
.
The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. -- mark 14:21
.
And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. -- mark 14:22
.
And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. -- mark 14:23
.
And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. -- mark 14:24
.
Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. -- mark 14:25
.
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. -- mark 14:26
.
And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. -- mark 14:27
.
But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. -- mark 14:28
.
But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I. -- mark 14:29
.
And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. -- mark 14:30
.
But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all. -- mark 14:31
.
And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. -- mark 14:32
.
And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; -- mark 14:33
.
And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch. -- mark 14:34
.
And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. -- mark 14:35
.
And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. -- mark 14:36
.
And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? -- mark 14:37
.
Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak. -- mark 14:38
.
And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. -- mark 14:39
.
And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him. -- mark 14:40
.
And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. -- mark 14:41
.
Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. -- mark 14:42
.
And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. -- mark 14:43
.
And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely. -- mark 14:44
.
And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him. -- mark 14:45
.
And they laid their hands on him, and took him. -- mark 14:46
.
And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. -- mark 14:47
.
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me? -- mark 14:48
.
I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. -- mark 14:49
.
And they all forsook him, and fled. -- mark 14:50
.
And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: -- mark 14:51
.
And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. -- mark 14:52
.
And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. -- mark 14:53
.
And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. -- mark 14:54
.
And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. -- mark 14:55
.
For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together. -- mark 14:56
.
And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, -- mark 14:57
.
We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands. -- mark 14:58
.
But neither so did their witness agree together. -- mark 14:59
.
And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? -- mark 14:60
.
But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? -- mark 14:61
.
And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. -- mark 14:62
.
Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? -- mark 14:63
.
Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. -- mark 14:64
.
And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands. -- mark 14:65
.
And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest: -- mark 14:66
.
And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. -- mark 14:67
.
But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew. -- mark 14:68
.
And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them. -- mark 14:69
.
And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto. -- mark 14:70
.
But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. -- mark 14:71
.
And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept. -- mark 14:72
.
And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. -- mark 15:1
.
And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it. -- mark 15:2
.
And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. -- mark 15:3
.
And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. -- mark 15:4
.
But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. -- mark 15:5
.
Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. -- mark 15:6
.
And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. -- mark 15:7
.
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. -- mark 15:8
.
But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? -- mark 15:9
.
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. -- mark 15:10
.
But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. -- mark 15:11
.
And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? -- mark 15:12
.
And they cried out again, Crucify him. -- mark 15:13
.
Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. -- mark 15:14
.
And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. -- mark 15:15
.
And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. -- mark 15:16
.
And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, -- mark 15:17
.
And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! -- mark 15:18
.
And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. -- mark 15:19
.
And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. -- mark 15:20
.
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. -- mark 15:21
.
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. -- mark 15:22
.
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. -- mark 15:23
.
And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. -- mark 15:24
.
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. -- mark 15:25
.
And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. -- mark 15:26
.
And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. -- mark 15:27
.
And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. -- mark 15:28
.
And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, -- mark 15:29
.
Save thyself, and come down from the cross. -- mark 15:30
.
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. -- mark 15:31
.
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. -- mark 15:32
.
And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. -- mark 15:33
.
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? -- mark 15:34
.
And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. -- mark 15:35
.
And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. -- mark 15:36
.
And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. -- mark 15:37
.
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. -- mark 15:38
.
And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. -- mark 15:39
.
There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; -- mark 15:40
.
(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem. -- mark 15:41
.
And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, -- mark 15:42
.
Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. -- mark 15:43
.
And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. -- mark 15:44
.
And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. -- mark 15:45
.
And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. -- mark 15:46
.
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid. -- mark 15:47
.
And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. -- mark 16:1
.
And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. -- mark 16:2
.
And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? -- mark 16:3
.
And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. -- mark 16:4
.
And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. -- mark 16:5
.
And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. -- mark 16:6
.
But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. -- mark 16:7
.
And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid. -- mark 16:8
.
Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. -- mark 16:9
.
And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. -- mark 16:10
.
And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not. -- mark 16:11
.
After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. -- mark 16:12
.
And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them. -- mark 16:13
.
Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. -- mark 16:14
.
And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. -- mark 16:15
.
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. -- mark 16:16
.
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; -- mark 16:17
.
They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. -- mark 16:18
.
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. -- mark 16:19
.
And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen. -- mark 16:20
.
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, -- luke 1:1
.
Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; -- luke 1:2
.
It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, -- luke 1:3
.
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed. -- luke 1:4
.
THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. -- luke 1:5
.
And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. -- luke 1:6
.
And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years. -- luke 1:7
.
And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, -- luke 1:8
.
According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. -- luke 1:9
.
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. -- luke 1:10
.
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. -- luke 1:11
.
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. -- luke 1:12
.
But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. -- luke 1:13
.
And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. -- luke 1:14
.
For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. -- luke 1:15
.
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. -- luke 1:16
.
And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. -- luke 1:17
.
And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. -- luke 1:18
.
And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. -- luke 1:19
.
And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. -- luke 1:20
.
And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. -- luke 1:21
.
And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless. -- luke 1:22
.
And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. -- luke 1:23
.
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, -- luke 1:24
.
Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men. -- luke 1:25
.
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, -- luke 1:26
.
To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. -- luke 1:27
.
And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. -- luke 1:28
.
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. -- luke 1:29
.
And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. -- luke 1:30
.
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. -- luke 1:31
.
He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: -- luke 1:32
.
And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. -- luke 1:33
.
Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? -- luke 1:34
.
And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. -- luke 1:35
.
And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. -- luke 1:36
.
For with God nothing shall be impossible. -- luke 1:37
.
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. -- luke 1:38
.
And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; -- luke 1:39
.
And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. -- luke 1:40
.
And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: -- luke 1:41
.
And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. -- luke 1:42
.
And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? -- luke 1:43
.
For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. -- luke 1:44
.
And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. -- luke 1:45
.
And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, -- luke 1:46
.
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. -- luke 1:47
.
For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. -- luke 1:48
.
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. -- luke 1:49
.
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. -- luke 1:50
.
He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. -- luke 1:51
.
He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. -- luke 1:52
.
He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. -- luke 1:53
.
He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; -- luke 1:54
.
As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever. -- luke 1:55
.
And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house. -- luke 1:56
.
Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. -- luke 1:57
.
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. -- luke 1:58
.
And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. -- luke 1:59
.
And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. -- luke 1:60
.
And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. -- luke 1:61
.
And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. -- luke 1:62
.
And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. -- luke 1:63
.
And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God. -- luke 1:64
.
And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. -- luke 1:65
.
And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. -- luke 1:66
.
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, -- luke 1:67
.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, -- luke 1:68
.
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; -- luke 1:69
.
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began: -- luke 1:70
.
That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; -- luke 1:71
.
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; -- luke 1:72
.
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, -- luke 1:73
.
That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, -- luke 1:74
.
In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. -- luke 1:75
.
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; -- luke 1:76
.
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, -- luke 1:77
.
Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, -- luke 1:78
.
To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. -- luke 1:79
.
And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel. -- luke 1:80
.
And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. -- luke 2:1
.
(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) -- luke 2:2
.
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. -- luke 2:3
.
And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) -- luke 2:4
.
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. -- luke 2:5
.
And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. -- luke 2:6
.
And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. -- luke 2:7
.
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. -- luke 2:8
.
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. -- luke 2:9
.
And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. -- luke 2:10
.
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. -- luke 2:11
.
And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. -- luke 2:12
.
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, -- luke 2:13
.
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. -- luke 2:14
.
And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. -- luke 2:15
.
And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. -- luke 2:16
.
And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. -- luke 2:17
.
And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. -- luke 2:18
.
But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. -- luke 2:19
.
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. -- luke 2:20
.
And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. -- luke 2:21
.
And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord; -- luke 2:22
.
(As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) -- luke 2:23
.
And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. -- luke 2:24
.
And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. -- luke 2:25
.
And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. -- luke 2:26
.
And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, -- luke 2:27
.
Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, -- luke 2:28
.
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: -- luke 2:29
.
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, -- luke 2:30
.
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; -- luke 2:31
.
A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. -- luke 2:32
.
And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. -- luke 2:33
.
And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; -- luke 2:34
.
(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. -- luke 2:35
.
And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; -- luke 2:36
.
And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. -- luke 2:37
.
And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. -- luke 2:38
.
And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. -- luke 2:39
.
And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. -- luke 2:40
.
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. -- luke 2:41
.
And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. -- luke 2:42
.
And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. -- luke 2:43
.
But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. -- luke 2:44
.
And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. -- luke 2:45
.
And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. -- luke 2:46
.
And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. -- luke 2:47
.
And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. -- luke 2:48
.
And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? -- luke 2:49
.
And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. -- luke 2:50
.
And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. -- luke 2:51
.
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. -- luke 2:52
.
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, -- luke 3:1
.
Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. -- luke 3:2
.
And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; -- luke 3:3
.
As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. -- luke 3:4
.
Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; -- luke 3:5
.
And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. -- luke 3:6
.
Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? -- luke 3:7
.
Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. -- luke 3:8
.
And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. -- luke 3:9
.
And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? -- luke 3:10
.
He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. -- luke 3:11
.
Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? -- luke 3:12
.
And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. -- luke 3:13
.
And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. -- luke 3:14
.
And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; -- luke 3:15
.
John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: -- luke 3:16
.
Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable. -- luke 3:17
.
And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people. -- luke 3:18
.
But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, -- luke 3:19
.
Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison. -- luke 3:20
.
Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, -- luke 3:21
.
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. -- luke 3:22
.
And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, -- luke 3:23
.
Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph, -- luke 3:24
.
Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge, -- luke 3:25
.
Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda, -- luke 3:26
.
Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri, -- luke 3:27
.
Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er, -- luke 3:28
.
Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, -- luke 3:29
.
Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim, -- luke 3:30
.
Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David, -- luke 3:31
.
Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson, -- luke 3:32
.
Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda, -- luke 3:33
.
Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor, -- luke 3:34
.
Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala, -- luke 3:35
.
Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech, -- luke 3:36
.
Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan, -- luke 3:37
.
Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God. -- luke 3:38
.
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, -- luke 4:1
.
Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. -- luke 4:2
.
And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. -- luke 4:3
.
And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. -- luke 4:4
.
And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. -- luke 4:5
.
And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. -- luke 4:6
.
If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. -- luke 4:7
.
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. -- luke 4:8
.
And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: -- luke 4:9
.
For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: -- luke 4:10
.
And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. -- luke 4:11
.
And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. -- luke 4:12
.
And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season. -- luke 4:13
.
And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. -- luke 4:14
.
And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. -- luke 4:15
.
And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. -- luke 4:16
.
And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, -- luke 4:17
.
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, -- luke 4:18
.
To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. -- luke 4:19
.
And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. -- luke 4:20
.
And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. -- luke 4:21
.
And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son? -- luke 4:22
.
And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country. -- luke 4:23
.
And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country. -- luke 4:24
.
But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; -- luke 4:25
.
But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. -- luke 4:26
.
And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. -- luke 4:27
.
And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, -- luke 4:28
.
And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. -- luke 4:29
.
But he passing through the midst of them went his way, -- luke 4:30
.
And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. -- luke 4:31
.
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power. -- luke 4:32
.
And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, -- luke 4:33
.
Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. -- luke 4:34
.
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not. -- luke 4:35
.
And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. -- luke 4:36
.
And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about. -- luke 4:37
.
And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her. -- luke 4:38
.
And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them. -- luke 4:39
.
Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. -- luke 4:40
.
And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. -- luke 4:41
.
And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. -- luke 4:42
.
And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. -- luke 4:43
.
And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee. -- luke 4:44
.
And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, -- luke 5:1
.
And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. -- luke 5:2
.
And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. -- luke 5:3
.
Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. -- luke 5:4
.
And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. -- luke 5:5
.
And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. -- luke 5:6
.
And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. -- luke 5:7
.
When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. -- luke 5:8
.
For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: -- luke 5:9
.
And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. -- luke 5:10
.
And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him. -- luke 5:11
.
And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. -- luke 5:12
.
And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. -- luke 5:13
.
And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. -- luke 5:14
.
But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. -- luke 5:15
.
And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed. -- luke 5:16
.
And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them. -- luke 5:17
.
And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. -- luke 5:18
.
And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. -- luke 5:19
.
And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. -- luke 5:20
.
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? -- luke 5:21
.
But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? -- luke 5:22
.
Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? -- luke 5:23
.
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. -- luke 5:24
.
And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. -- luke 5:25
.
And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day. -- luke 5:26
.
And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. -- luke 5:27
.
And he left all, rose up, and followed him. -- luke 5:28
.
And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. -- luke 5:29
.
But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? -- luke 5:30
.
And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. -- luke 5:31
.
I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. -- luke 5:32
.
And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? -- luke 5:33
.
And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? -- luke 5:34
.
But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. -- luke 5:35
.
And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old. -- luke 5:36
.
And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. -- luke 5:37
.
But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. -- luke 5:38
.
No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better. -- luke 5:39
.
And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. -- luke 6:1
.
And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? -- luke 6:2
.
And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; -- luke 6:3
.
How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? -- luke 6:4
.
And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. -- luke 6:5
.
And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered. -- luke 6:6
.
And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. -- luke 6:7
.
But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. -- luke 6:8
.
Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it? -- luke 6:9
.
And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. -- luke 6:10
.
And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. -- luke 6:11
.
And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. -- luke 6:12
.
And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; -- luke 6:13
.
Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, -- luke 6:14
.
Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes, -- luke 6:15
.
And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor. -- luke 6:16
.
And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; -- luke 6:17
.
And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed. -- luke 6:18
.
And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all. -- luke 6:19
.
And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. -- luke 6:20
.
Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. -- luke 6:21
.
Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. -- luke 6:22
.
Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets. -- luke 6:23
.
But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. -- luke 6:24
.
Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. -- luke 6:25
.
Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. -- luke 6:26
.
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, -- luke 6:27
.
Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. -- luke 6:28
.
And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. -- luke 6:29
.
Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. -- luke 6:30
.
And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. -- luke 6:31
.
For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. -- luke 6:32
.
And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. -- luke 6:33
.
And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. -- luke 6:34
.
But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. -- luke 6:35
.
Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. -- luke 6:36
.
Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: -- luke 6:37
.
Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. -- luke 6:38
.
And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? -- luke 6:39
.
The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master. -- luke 6:40
.
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? -- luke 6:41
.
Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. -- luke 6:42
.
For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. -- luke 6:43
.
For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. -- luke 6:44
.
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. -- luke 6:45
.
And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? -- luke 6:46
.
Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: -- luke 6:47
.
He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. -- luke 6:48
.
But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great. -- luke 6:49
.
Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum. -- luke 7:1
.
And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. -- luke 7:2
.
And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. -- luke 7:3
.
And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: -- luke 7:4
.
For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. -- luke 7:5
.
Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: -- luke 7:6
.
Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. -- luke 7:7
.
For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. -- luke 7:8
.
When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. -- luke 7:9
.
And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. -- luke 7:10
.
And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. -- luke 7:11
.
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. -- luke 7:12
.
And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. -- luke 7:13
.
And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. -- luke 7:14
.
And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. -- luke 7:15
.
And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. -- luke 7:16
.
And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about. -- luke 7:17
.
And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. -- luke 7:18
.
And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? -- luke 7:19
.
When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? -- luke 7:20
.
And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight. -- luke 7:21
.
Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. -- luke 7:22
.
And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. -- luke 7:23
.
And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? -- luke 7:24
.
But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. -- luke 7:25
.
But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. -- luke 7:26
.
This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. -- luke 7:27
.
For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. -- luke 7:28
.
And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. -- luke 7:29
.
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. -- luke 7:30
.
And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? -- luke 7:31
.
They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. -- luke 7:32
.
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. -- luke 7:33
.
The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! -- luke 7:34
.
But wisdom is justified of all her children. -- luke 7:35
.
And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. -- luke 7:36
.
And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, -- luke 7:37
.
And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. -- luke 7:38
.
Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. -- luke 7:39
.
And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. -- luke 7:40
.
There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. -- luke 7:41
.
And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? -- luke 7:42
.
Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. -- luke 7:43
.
And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. -- luke 7:44
.
Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. -- luke 7:45
.
My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. -- luke 7:46
.
Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. -- luke 7:47
.
And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. -- luke 7:48
.
And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? -- luke 7:49
.
And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. -- luke 7:50
.
And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him, -- luke 8:1
.
And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, -- luke 8:2
.
And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance. -- luke 8:3
.
And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: -- luke 8:4
.
A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. -- luke 8:5
.
And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. -- luke 8:6
.
And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. -- luke 8:7
.
And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. -- luke 8:8
.
And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? -- luke 8:9
.
And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. -- luke 8:10
.
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. -- luke 8:11
.
Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. -- luke 8:12
.
They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. -- luke 8:13
.
And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. -- luke 8:14
.
But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. -- luke 8:15
.
No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light. -- luke 8:16
.
For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. -- luke 8:17
.
Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. -- luke 8:18
.
Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press. -- luke 8:19
.
And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. -- luke 8:20
.
And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it. -- luke 8:21
.
Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. -- luke 8:22
.
But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy. -- luke 8:23
.
And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. -- luke 8:24
.
And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him. -- luke 8:25
.
And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. -- luke 8:26
.
And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs. -- luke 8:27
.
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. -- luke 8:28
.
(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) -- luke 8:29
.
And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him. -- luke 8:30
.
And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep. -- luke 8:31
.
And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them. -- luke 8:32
.
Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. -- luke 8:33
.
When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country. -- luke 8:34
.
Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. -- luke 8:35
.
They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed. -- luke 8:36
.
Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again. -- luke 8:37
.
Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, -- luke 8:38
.
Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. -- luke 8:39
.
And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him. -- luke 8:40
.
And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: -- luke 8:41
.
For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. -- luke 8:42
.
And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, -- luke 8:43
.
Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched. -- luke 8:44
.
And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? -- luke 8:45
.
And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. -- luke 8:46
.
And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. -- luke 8:47
.
And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. -- luke 8:48
.
While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. -- luke 8:49
.
But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. -- luke 8:50
.
And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. -- luke 8:51
.
And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth. -- luke 8:52
.
And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. -- luke 8:53
.
And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise. -- luke 8:54
.
And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat. -- luke 8:55
.
And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done. -- luke 8:56
.
Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. -- luke 9:1
.
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. -- luke 9:2
.
And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece. -- luke 9:3
.
And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. -- luke 9:4
.
And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. -- luke 9:5
.
And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where. -- luke 9:6
.
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead; -- luke 9:7
.
And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. -- luke 9:8
.
And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him. -- luke 9:9
.
And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. -- luke 9:10
.
And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing. -- luke 9:11
.
And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. -- luke 9:12
.
But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people. -- luke 9:13
.
For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company. -- luke 9:14
.
And they did so, and made them all sit down. -- luke 9:15
.
Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. -- luke 9:16
.
And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets. -- luke 9:17
.
And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? -- luke 9:18
.
They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again. -- luke 9:19
.
He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God. -- luke 9:20
.
And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing; -- luke 9:21
.
Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day. -- luke 9:22
.
And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. -- luke 9:23
.
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. -- luke 9:24
.
For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away? -- luke 9:25
.
For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels. -- luke 9:26
.
But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. -- luke 9:27
.
And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. -- luke 9:28
.
And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. -- luke 9:29
.
And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: -- luke 9:30
.
Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. -- luke 9:31
.
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. -- luke 9:32
.
And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. -- luke 9:33
.
While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. -- luke 9:34
.
And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. -- luke 9:35
.
And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen. -- luke 9:36
.
And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him. -- luke 9:37
.
And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child. -- luke 9:38
.
And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him. -- luke 9:39
.
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. -- luke 9:40
.
And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. -- luke 9:41
.
And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. -- luke 9:42
.
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, -- luke 9:43
.
Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. -- luke 9:44
.
But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying. -- luke 9:45
.
Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. -- luke 9:46
.
And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, -- luke 9:47
.
And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great. -- luke 9:48
.
And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. -- luke 9:49
.
And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. -- luke 9:50
.
And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, -- luke 9:51
.
And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. -- luke 9:52
.
And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. -- luke 9:53
.
And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? -- luke 9:54
.
But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. -- luke 9:55
.
For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village. -- luke 9:56
.
And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. -- luke 9:57
.
And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. -- luke 9:58
.
And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. -- luke 9:59
.
Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. -- luke 9:60
.
And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. -- luke 9:61
.
And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. -- luke 9:62
.
After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. -- luke 10:1
.
Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. -- luke 10:2
.
Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. -- luke 10:3
.
Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. -- luke 10:4
.
And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. -- luke 10:5
.
And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. -- luke 10:6
.
And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. -- luke 10:7
.
And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: -- luke 10:8
.
And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. -- luke 10:9
.
But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, -- luke 10:10
.
Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. -- luke 10:11
.
But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. -- luke 10:12
.
Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. -- luke 10:13
.
But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. -- luke 10:14
.
And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. -- luke 10:15
.
He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. -- luke 10:16
.
And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. -- luke 10:17
.
And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. -- luke 10:18
.
Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. -- luke 10:19
.
Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. -- luke 10:20
.
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. -- luke 10:21
.
All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. -- luke 10:22
.
And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: -- luke 10:23
.
For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. -- luke 10:24
.
And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? -- luke 10:25
.
He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? -- luke 10:26
.
And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. -- luke 10:27
.
And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. -- luke 10:28
.
But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? -- luke 10:29
.
And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. -- luke 10:30
.
And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. -- luke 10:31
.
And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. -- luke 10:32
.
But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, -- luke 10:33
.
And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. -- luke 10:34
.
And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. -- luke 10:35
.
Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? -- luke 10:36
.
And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. -- luke 10:37
.
Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. -- luke 10:38
.
And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. -- luke 10:39
.
But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. -- luke 10:40
.
And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: -- luke 10:41
.
But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. -- luke 10:42
.
And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. -- luke 11:1
.
And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. -- luke 11:2
.
Give us day by day our daily bread. -- luke 11:3
.
And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. -- luke 11:4
.
And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; -- luke 11:5
.
For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? -- luke 11:6
.
And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. -- luke 11:7
.
I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. -- luke 11:8
.
And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. -- luke 11:9
.
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. -- luke 11:10
.
If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? -- luke 11:11
.
Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? -- luke 11:12
.
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? -- luke 11:13
.
And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered. -- luke 11:14
.
But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils. -- luke 11:15
.
And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven. -- luke 11:16
.
But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth. -- luke 11:17
.
If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub. -- luke 11:18
.
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. -- luke 11:19
.
But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. -- luke 11:20
.
When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: -- luke 11:21
.
But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. -- luke 11:22
.
He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. -- luke 11:23
.
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out. -- luke 11:24
.
And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. -- luke 11:25
.
Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. -- luke 11:26
.
And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. -- luke 11:27
.
But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it. -- luke 11:28
.
And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet. -- luke 11:29
.
For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. -- luke 11:30
.
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. -- luke 11:31
.
The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. -- luke 11:32
.
No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light. -- luke 11:33
.
The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. -- luke 11:34
.
Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. -- luke 11:35
.
If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light. -- luke 11:36
.
And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. -- luke 11:37
.
And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner. -- luke 11:38
.
And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness. -- luke 11:39
.
Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also? -- luke 11:40
.
But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you. -- luke 11:41
.
But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. -- luke 11:42
.
Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets. -- luke 11:43
.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them. -- luke 11:44
.
Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also. -- luke 11:45
.
And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. -- luke 11:46
.
Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. -- luke 11:47
.
Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres. -- luke 11:48
.
Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute: -- luke 11:49
.
That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; -- luke 11:50
.
From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation. -- luke 11:51
.
Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. -- luke 11:52
.
And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things: -- luke 11:53
.
Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him. -- luke 11:54
.
In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. -- luke 12:1
.
For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known. -- luke 12:2
.
Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. -- luke 12:3
.
And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. -- luke 12:4
.
But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. -- luke 12:5
.
Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? -- luke 12:6
.
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. -- luke 12:7
.
Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: -- luke 12:8
.
But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God. -- luke 12:9
.
And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven. -- luke 12:10
.
And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: -- luke 12:11
.
For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say. -- luke 12:12
.
And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. -- luke 12:13
.
And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? -- luke 12:14
.
And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. -- luke 12:15
.
And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: -- luke 12:16
.
And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? -- luke 12:17
.
And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. -- luke 12:18
.
And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. -- luke 12:19
.
But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? -- luke 12:20
.
So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. -- luke 12:21
.
And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on. -- luke 12:22
.
The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment. -- luke 12:23
.
Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? -- luke 12:24
.
And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? -- luke 12:25
.
If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? -- luke 12:26
.
Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. -- luke 12:27
.
If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith? -- luke 12:28
.
And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. -- luke 12:29
.
For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. -- luke 12:30
.
But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you. -- luke 12:31
.
Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. -- luke 12:32
.
Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. -- luke 12:33
.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. -- luke 12:34
.
Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; -- luke 12:35
.
And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. -- luke 12:36
.
Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. -- luke 12:37
.
And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. -- luke 12:38
.
And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through. -- luke 12:39
.
Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not. -- luke 12:40
.
Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all? -- luke 12:41
.
And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season? -- luke 12:42
.
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. -- luke 12:43
.
Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath. -- luke 12:44
.
But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; -- luke 12:45
.
The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. -- luke 12:46
.
And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. -- luke 12:47
.
But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. -- luke 12:48
.
I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? -- luke 12:49
.
But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! -- luke 12:50
.
Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: -- luke 12:51
.
For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. -- luke 12:52
.
The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. -- luke 12:53
.
And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. -- luke 12:54
.
And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass. -- luke 12:55
.
Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time? -- luke 12:56
.
Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? -- luke 12:57
.
When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. -- luke 12:58
.
I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite. -- luke 12:59
.
There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. -- luke 13:1
.
And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? -- luke 13:2
.
I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. -- luke 13:3
.
Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? -- luke 13:4
.
I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. -- luke 13:5
.
He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. -- luke 13:6
.
Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? -- luke 13:7
.
And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: -- luke 13:8
.
And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. -- luke 13:9
.
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. -- luke 13:10
.
And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. -- luke 13:11
.
And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. -- luke 13:12
.
And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. -- luke 13:13
.
And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. -- luke 13:14
.
The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? -- luke 13:15
.
And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? -- luke 13:16
.
And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. -- luke 13:17
.
Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? -- luke 13:18
.
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. -- luke 13:19
.
And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? -- luke 13:20
.
It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. -- luke 13:21
.
And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. -- luke 13:22
.
Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, -- luke 13:23
.
Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. -- luke 13:24
.
When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: -- luke 13:25
.
Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. -- luke 13:26
.
But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. -- luke 13:27
.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. -- luke 13:28
.
And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. -- luke 13:29
.
And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last. -- luke 13:30
.
The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee. -- luke 13:31
.
And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected. -- luke 13:32
.
Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. -- luke 13:33
.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! -- luke 13:34
.
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. -- luke 13:35
.
And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. -- luke 14:1
.
And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. -- luke 14:2
.
And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? -- luke 14:3
.
And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; -- luke 14:4
.
And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? -- luke 14:5
.
And they could not answer him again to these things. -- luke 14:6
.
And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them. -- luke 14:7
.
When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; -- luke 14:8
.
And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. -- luke 14:9
.
But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. -- luke 14:10
.
For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. -- luke 14:11
.
Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. -- luke 14:12
.
But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: -- luke 14:13
.
And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. -- luke 14:14
.
And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. -- luke 14:15
.
Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: -- luke 14:16
.
And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. -- luke 14:17
.
And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. -- luke 14:18
.
And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. -- luke 14:19
.
And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. -- luke 14:20
.
So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. -- luke 14:21
.
And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. -- luke 14:22
.
And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. -- luke 14:23
.
For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. -- luke 14:24
.
And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, -- luke 14:25
.
If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. -- luke 14:26
.
And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. -- luke 14:27
.
For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? -- luke 14:28
.
Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, -- luke 14:29
.
Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. -- luke 14:30
.
Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? -- luke 14:31
.
Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. -- luke 14:32
.
So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. -- luke 14:33
.
Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? -- luke 14:34
.
It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. -- luke 14:35
.
Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him. -- luke 15:1
.
And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. -- luke 15:2
.
And he spake this parable unto them, saying, -- luke 15:3
.
What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? -- luke 15:4
.
And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. -- luke 15:5
.
And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. -- luke 15:6
.
I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. -- luke 15:7
.
Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? -- luke 15:8
.
And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. -- luke 15:9
.
Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. -- luke 15:10
.
And he said, A certain man had two sons: -- luke 15:11
.
And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. -- luke 15:12
.
And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. -- luke 15:13
.
And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. -- luke 15:14
.
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. -- luke 15:15
.
And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. -- luke 15:16
.
And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! -- luke 15:17
.
I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, -- luke 15:18
.
And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. -- luke 15:19
.
And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. -- luke 15:20
.
And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. -- luke 15:21
.
But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: -- luke 15:22
.
And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: -- luke 15:23
.
For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. -- luke 15:24
.
Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. -- luke 15:25
.
And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. -- luke 15:26
.
And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. -- luke 15:27
.
And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him. -- luke 15:28
.
And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: -- luke 15:29
.
But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. -- luke 15:30
.
And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. -- luke 15:31
.
It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. -- luke 15:32
.
And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. -- luke 16:1
.
And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. -- luke 16:2
.
Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. -- luke 16:3
.
I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. -- luke 16:4
.
So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? -- luke 16:5
.
And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. -- luke 16:6
.
Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. -- luke 16:7
.
And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. -- luke 16:8
.
And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. -- luke 16:9
.
He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. -- luke 16:10
.
If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? -- luke 16:11
.
And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? -- luke 16:12
.
No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. -- luke 16:13
.
And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. -- luke 16:14
.
And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. -- luke 16:15
.
The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. -- luke 16:16
.
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. -- luke 16:17
.
Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery. -- luke 16:18
.
There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: -- luke 16:19
.
And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, -- luke 16:20
.
And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. -- luke 16:21
.
And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; -- luke 16:22
.
And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. -- luke 16:23
.
And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. -- luke 16:24
.
But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. -- luke 16:25
.
And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. -- luke 16:26
.
Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: -- luke 16:27
.
For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. -- luke 16:28
.
Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. -- luke 16:29
.
And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. -- luke 16:30
.
And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. -- luke 16:31
.
Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! -- luke 17:1
.
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones. -- luke 17:2
.
Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. -- luke 17:3
.
And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. -- luke 17:4
.
And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. -- luke 17:5
.
And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. -- luke 17:6
.
But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? -- luke 17:7
.
And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? -- luke 17:8
.
Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. -- luke 17:9
.
So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. -- luke 17:10
.
And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. -- luke 17:11
.
And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: -- luke 17:12
.
And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. -- luke 17:13
.
And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. -- luke 17:14
.
And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, -- luke 17:15
.
And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. -- luke 17:16
.
And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? -- luke 17:17
.
There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. -- luke 17:18
.
And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. -- luke 17:19
.
And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: -- luke 17:20
.
Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. -- luke 17:21
.
And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it. -- luke 17:22
.
And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them. -- luke 17:23
.
For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. -- luke 17:24
.
But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. -- luke 17:25
.
And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. -- luke 17:26
.
They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. -- luke 17:27
.
Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; -- luke 17:28
.
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. -- luke 17:29
.
Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. -- luke 17:30
.
In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. -- luke 17:31
.
Remember Lot's wife. -- luke 17:32
.
Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. -- luke 17:33
.
I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. -- luke 17:34
.
Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. -- luke 17:35
.
Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. -- luke 17:36
.
And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together. -- luke 17:37
.
And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; -- luke 18:1
.
Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: -- luke 18:2
.
And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. -- luke 18:3
.
And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; -- luke 18:4
.
Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. -- luke 18:5
.
And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. -- luke 18:6
.
And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? -- luke 18:7
.
I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? -- luke 18:8
.
And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: -- luke 18:9
.
Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. -- luke 18:10
.
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. -- luke 18:11
.
I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. -- luke 18:12
.
And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. -- luke 18:13
.
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. -- luke 18:14
.
And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. -- luke 18:15
.
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. -- luke 18:16
.
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. -- luke 18:17
.
And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? -- luke 18:18
.
And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God. -- luke 18:19
.
Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. -- luke 18:20
.
And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. -- luke 18:21
.
Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. -- luke 18:22
.
And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. -- luke 18:23
.
And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! -- luke 18:24
.
For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. -- luke 18:25
.
And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? -- luke 18:26
.
And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. -- luke 18:27
.
Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. -- luke 18:28
.
And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, -- luke 18:29
.
Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. -- luke 18:30
.
Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. -- luke 18:31
.
For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: -- luke 18:32
.
And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. -- luke 18:33
.
And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. -- luke 18:34
.
And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: -- luke 18:35
.
And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. -- luke 18:36
.
And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. -- luke 18:37
.
And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. -- luke 18:38
.
And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. -- luke 18:39
.
And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, -- luke 18:40
.
Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. -- luke 18:41
.
And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. -- luke 18:42
.
And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. -- luke 18:43
.
And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. -- luke 19:1
.
And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. -- luke 19:2
.
And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. -- luke 19:3
.
And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. -- luke 19:4
.
And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. -- luke 19:5
.
And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. -- luke 19:6
.
And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. -- luke 19:7
.
And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. -- luke 19:8
.
And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. -- luke 19:9
.
For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. -- luke 19:10
.
And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. -- luke 19:11
.
He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. -- luke 19:12
.
And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. -- luke 19:13
.
But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. -- luke 19:14
.
And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. -- luke 19:15
.
Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. -- luke 19:16
.
And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. -- luke 19:17
.
And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. -- luke 19:18
.
And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. -- luke 19:19
.
And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: -- luke 19:20
.
For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. -- luke 19:21
.
And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: -- luke 19:22
.
Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? -- luke 19:23
.
And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. -- luke 19:24
.
(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) -- luke 19:25
.
For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. -- luke 19:26
.
But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. -- luke 19:27
.
And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. -- luke 19:28
.
And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, -- luke 19:29
.
Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. -- luke 19:30
.
And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. -- luke 19:31
.
And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. -- luke 19:32
.
And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? -- luke 19:33
.
And they said, The Lord hath need of him. -- luke 19:34
.
And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. -- luke 19:35
.
And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. -- luke 19:36
.
And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; -- luke 19:37
.
Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. -- luke 19:38
.
And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. -- luke 19:39
.
And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. -- luke 19:40
.
And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, -- luke 19:41
.
Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. -- luke 19:42
.
For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, -- luke 19:43
.
And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. -- luke 19:44
.
And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; -- luke 19:45
.
Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. -- luke 19:46
.
And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, -- luke 19:47
.
And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. -- luke 19:48
.
And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, -- luke 20:1
.
And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? -- luke 20:2
.
And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: -- luke 20:3
.
The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? -- luke 20:4
.
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? -- luke 20:5
.
But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet. -- luke 20:6
.
And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was. -- luke 20:7
.
And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. -- luke 20:8
.
Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. -- luke 20:9
.
And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. -- luke 20:10
.
And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. -- luke 20:11
.
And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out. -- luke 20:12
.
Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him. -- luke 20:13
.
But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. -- luke 20:14
.
So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? -- luke 20:15
.
He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. -- luke 20:16
.
And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? -- luke 20:17
.
Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. -- luke 20:18
.
And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. -- luke 20:19
.
And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. -- luke 20:20
.
And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: -- luke 20:21
.
Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? -- luke 20:22
.
But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? -- luke 20:23
.
Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. -- luke 20:24
.
And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. -- luke 20:25
.
And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace. -- luke 20:26
.
Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him, -- luke 20:27
.
Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. -- luke 20:28
.
There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children. -- luke 20:29
.
And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. -- luke 20:30
.
And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died. -- luke 20:31
.
Last of all the woman died also. -- luke 20:32
.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife. -- luke 20:33
.
And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: -- luke 20:34
.
But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: -- luke 20:35
.
Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. -- luke 20:36
.
Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. -- luke 20:37
.
For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. -- luke 20:38
.
Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said. -- luke 20:39
.
And after that they durst not ask him any question at all. -- luke 20:40
.
And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son? -- luke 20:41
.
And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, -- luke 20:42
.
Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. -- luke 20:43
.
David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? -- luke 20:44
.
Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples, -- luke 20:45
.
Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; -- luke 20:46
.
Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation. -- luke 20:47
.
And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. -- luke 21:1
.
And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. -- luke 21:2
.
And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all: -- luke 21:3
.
For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had. -- luke 21:4
.
And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said, -- luke 21:5
.
As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. -- luke 21:6
.
And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass? -- luke 21:7
.
And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. -- luke 21:8
.
But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by. -- luke 21:9
.
Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: -- luke 21:10
.
And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. -- luke 21:11
.
But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. -- luke 21:12
.
And it shall turn to you for a testimony. -- luke 21:13
.
Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: -- luke 21:14
.
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. -- luke 21:15
.
And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. -- luke 21:16
.
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake. -- luke 21:17
.
But there shall not an hair of your head perish. -- luke 21:18
.
In your patience possess ye your souls. -- luke 21:19
.
And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. -- luke 21:20
.
Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. -- luke 21:21
.
For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. -- luke 21:22
.
But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. -- luke 21:23
.
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. -- luke 21:24
.
And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; -- luke 21:25
.
Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. -- luke 21:26
.
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. -- luke 21:27
.
And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. -- luke 21:28
.
And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; -- luke 21:29
.
When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. -- luke 21:30
.
So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. -- luke 21:31
.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled. -- luke 21:32
.
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. -- luke 21:33
.
And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. -- luke 21:34
.
For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. -- luke 21:35
.
Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. -- luke 21:36
.
And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives. -- luke 21:37
.
And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him. -- luke 21:38
.
Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. -- luke 22:1
.
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people. -- luke 22:2
.
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. -- luke 22:3
.
And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. -- luke 22:4
.
And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. -- luke 22:5
.
And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. -- luke 22:6
.
Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed. -- luke 22:7
.
And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. -- luke 22:8
.
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? -- luke 22:9
.
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. -- luke 22:10
.
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? -- luke 22:11
.
And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. -- luke 22:12
.
And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. -- luke 22:13
.
And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. -- luke 22:14
.
And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: -- luke 22:15
.
For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. -- luke 22:16
.
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: -- luke 22:17
.
For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. -- luke 22:18
.
And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. -- luke 22:19
.
Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. -- luke 22:20
.
But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. -- luke 22:21
.
And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! -- luke 22:22
.
And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. -- luke 22:23
.
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. -- luke 22:24
.
And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. -- luke 22:25
.
But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. -- luke 22:26
.
For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. -- luke 22:27
.
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. -- luke 22:28
.
And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; -- luke 22:29
.
That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. -- luke 22:30
.
And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: -- luke 22:31
.
But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. -- luke 22:32
.
And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. -- luke 22:33
.
And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. -- luke 22:34
.
And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. -- luke 22:35
.
Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. -- luke 22:36
.
For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. -- luke 22:37
.
And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. -- luke 22:38
.
And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. -- luke 22:39
.
And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. -- luke 22:40
.
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, -- luke 22:41
.
Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. -- luke 22:42
.
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. -- luke 22:43
.
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. -- luke 22:44
.
And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, -- luke 22:45
.
And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. -- luke 22:46
.
And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. -- luke 22:47
.
But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? -- luke 22:48
.
When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? -- luke 22:49
.
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. -- luke 22:50
.
And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. -- luke 22:51
.
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? -- luke 22:52
.
When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. -- luke 22:53
.
Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. -- luke 22:54
.
And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. -- luke 22:55
.
But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. -- luke 22:56
.
And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. -- luke 22:57
.
And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. -- luke 22:58
.
And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. -- luke 22:59
.
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. -- luke 22:60
.
And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. -- luke 22:61
.
And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. -- luke 22:62
.
And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. -- luke 22:63
.
And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? -- luke 22:64
.
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. -- luke 22:65
.
And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, -- luke 22:66
.
Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: -- luke 22:67
.
And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. -- luke 22:68
.
Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. -- luke 22:69
.
Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. -- luke 22:70
.
And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth. -- luke 22:71
.
And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. -- luke 23:1
.
And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. -- luke 23:2
.
And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. -- luke 23:3
.
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. -- luke 23:4
.
And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. -- luke 23:5
.
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. -- luke 23:6
.
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. -- luke 23:7
.
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. -- luke 23:8
.
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. -- luke 23:9
.
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. -- luke 23:10
.
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. -- luke 23:11
.
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. -- luke 23:12
.
And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, -- luke 23:13
.
Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: -- luke 23:14
.
No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. -- luke 23:15
.
I will therefore chastise him, and release him. -- luke 23:16
.
(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) -- luke 23:17
.
And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: -- luke 23:18
.
(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) -- luke 23:19
.
Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. -- luke 23:20
.
But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. -- luke 23:21
.
And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. -- luke 23:22
.
And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. -- luke 23:23
.
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. -- luke 23:24
.
And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. -- luke 23:25
.
And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. -- luke 23:26
.
And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. -- luke 23:27
.
But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. -- luke 23:28
.
For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. -- luke 23:29
.
Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. -- luke 23:30
.
For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? -- luke 23:31
.
And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. -- luke 23:32
.
And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. -- luke 23:33
.
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. -- luke 23:34
.
And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. -- luke 23:35
.
And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, -- luke 23:36
.
And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. -- luke 23:37
.
And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. -- luke 23:38
.
And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. -- luke 23:39
.
But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? -- luke 23:40
.
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. -- luke 23:41
.
And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. -- luke 23:42
.
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. -- luke 23:43
.
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. -- luke 23:44
.
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. -- luke 23:45
.
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. -- luke 23:46
.
Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. -- luke 23:47
.
And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. -- luke 23:48
.
And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. -- luke 23:49
.
And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: -- luke 23:50
.
(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. -- luke 23:51
.
This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. -- luke 23:52
.
And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. -- luke 23:53
.
And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. -- luke 23:54
.
And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. -- luke 23:55
.
And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment. -- luke 23:56
.
Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. -- luke 24:1
.
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. -- luke 24:2
.
And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. -- luke 24:3
.
And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: -- luke 24:4
.
And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? -- luke 24:5
.
He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, -- luke 24:6
.
Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. -- luke 24:7
.
And they remembered his words, -- luke 24:8
.
And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. -- luke 24:9
.
It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. -- luke 24:10
.
And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. -- luke 24:11
.
Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. -- luke 24:12
.
And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. -- luke 24:13
.
And they talked together of all these things which had happened. -- luke 24:14
.
And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. -- luke 24:15
.
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. -- luke 24:16
.
And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? -- luke 24:17
.
And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? -- luke 24:18
.
And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: -- luke 24:19
.
And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. -- luke 24:20
.
But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. -- luke 24:21
.
Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; -- luke 24:22
.
And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. -- luke 24:23
.
And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. -- luke 24:24
.
Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: -- luke 24:25
.
Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? -- luke 24:26
.
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. -- luke 24:27
.
And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. -- luke 24:28
.
But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. -- luke 24:29
.
And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. -- luke 24:30
.
And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. -- luke 24:31
.
And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? -- luke 24:32
.
And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, -- luke 24:33
.
Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. -- luke 24:34
.
And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. -- luke 24:35
.
And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. -- luke 24:36
.
But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. -- luke 24:37
.
And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? -- luke 24:38
.
Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. -- luke 24:39
.
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. -- luke 24:40
.
And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? -- luke 24:41
.
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. -- luke 24:42
.
And he took it, and did eat before them. -- luke 24:43
.
And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. -- luke 24:44
.
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, -- luke 24:45
.
And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: -- luke 24:46
.
And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. -- luke 24:47
.
And ye are witnesses of these things. -- luke 24:48
.
And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. -- luke 24:49
.
And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. -- luke 24:50
.
And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. -- luke 24:51
.
And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: -- luke 24:52
.
And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. -- luke 24:53
.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. -- john 1:1
.
The same was in the beginning with God. -- john 1:2
.
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. -- john 1:3
.
In him was life; and the life was the light of men. -- john 1:4
.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. -- john 1:5
.
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. -- john 1:6
.
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. -- john 1:7
.
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. -- john 1:8
.
That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. -- john 1:9
.
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. -- john 1:10
.
He came unto his own, and his own received him not. -- john 1:11
.
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: -- john 1:12
.
Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. -- john 1:13
.
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. -- john 1:14
.
John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. -- john 1:15
.
And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. -- john 1:16
.
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. -- john 1:17
.
No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. -- john 1:18
.
And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? -- john 1:19
.
And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. -- john 1:20
.
And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. -- john 1:21
.
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? -- john 1:22
.
He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. -- john 1:23
.
And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. -- john 1:24
.
And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? -- john 1:25
.
John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; -- john 1:26
.
He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. -- john 1:27
.
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. -- john 1:28
.
The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. -- john 1:29
.
This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. -- john 1:30
.
And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. -- john 1:31
.
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. -- john 1:32
.
And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. -- john 1:33
.
And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. -- john 1:34
.
Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; -- john 1:35
.
And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! -- john 1:36
.
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. -- john 1:37
.
Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? -- john 1:38
.
He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. -- john 1:39
.
One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. -- john 1:40
.
He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. -- john 1:41
.
And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. -- john 1:42
.
The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. -- john 1:43
.
Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. -- john 1:44
.
Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. -- john 1:45
.
And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. -- john 1:46
.
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! -- john 1:47
.
Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. -- john 1:48
.
Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. -- john 1:49
.
Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. -- john 1:50
.
And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. -- john 1:51
.
And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: -- john 2:1
.
And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. -- john 2:2
.
And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. -- john 2:3
.
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. -- john 2:4
.
His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. -- john 2:5
.
And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. -- john 2:6
.
Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. -- john 2:7
.
And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. -- john 2:8
.
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, -- john 2:9
.
And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. -- john 2:10
.
This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. -- john 2:11
.
After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. -- john 2:12
.
And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. -- john 2:13
.
And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: -- john 2:14
.
And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; -- john 2:15
.
And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. -- john 2:16
.
And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. -- john 2:17
.
Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? -- john 2:18
.
Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. -- john 2:19
.
Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? -- john 2:20
.
But he spake of the temple of his body. -- john 2:21
.
When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. -- john 2:22
.
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. -- john 2:23
.
But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, -- john 2:24
.
And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. -- john 2:25
.
There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: -- john 3:1
.
The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. -- john 3:2
.
Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. -- john 3:3
.
Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? -- john 3:4
.
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. -- john 3:5
.
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. -- john 3:6
.
Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. -- john 3:7
.
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. -- john 3:8
.
Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? -- john 3:9
.
Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? -- john 3:10
.
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. -- john 3:11
.
If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? -- john 3:12
.
And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. -- john 3:13
.
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: -- john 3:14
.
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. -- john 3:15
.
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. -- john 3:16
.
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. -- john 3:17
.
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. -- john 3:18
.
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. -- john 3:19
.
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. -- john 3:20
.
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. -- john 3:21
.
After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. -- john 3:22
.
And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. -- john 3:23
.
For John was not yet cast into prison. -- john 3:24
.
Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. -- john 3:25
.
And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. -- john 3:26
.
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. -- john 3:27
.
Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. -- john 3:28
.
He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. -- john 3:29
.
He must increase, but I must decrease. -- john 3:30
.
He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. -- john 3:31
.
And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. -- john 3:32
.
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. -- john 3:33
.
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. -- john 3:34
.
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. -- john 3:35
.
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. -- john 3:36
.
When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, -- john 4:1
.
(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) -- john 4:2
.
He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. -- john 4:3
.
And he must needs go through Samaria. -- john 4:4
.
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. -- john 4:5
.
Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. -- john 4:6
.
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. -- john 4:7
.
(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) -- john 4:8
.
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. -- john 4:9
.
Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. -- john 4:10
.
The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? -- john 4:11
.
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? -- john 4:12
.
Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: -- john 4:13
.
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. -- john 4:14
.
The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. -- john 4:15
.
Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. -- john 4:16
.
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: -- john 4:17
.
For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. -- john 4:18
.
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. -- john 4:19
.
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. -- john 4:20
.
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. -- john 4:21
.
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. -- john 4:22
.
But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. -- john 4:23
.
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. -- john 4:24
.
The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. -- john 4:25
.
Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. -- john 4:26
.
And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? -- john 4:27
.
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, -- john 4:28
.
Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? -- john 4:29
.
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. -- john 4:30
.
In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. -- john 4:31
.
But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. -- john 4:32
.
Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? -- john 4:33
.
Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. -- john 4:34
.
Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. -- john 4:35
.
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. -- john 4:36
.
And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. -- john 4:37
.
I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. -- john 4:38
.
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. -- john 4:39
.
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. -- john 4:40
.
And many more believed because of his own word; -- john 4:41
.
And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. -- john 4:42
.
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. -- john 4:43
.
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. -- john 4:44
.
Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. -- john 4:45
.
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. -- john 4:46
.
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. -- john 4:47
.
Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. -- john 4:48
.
The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. -- john 4:49
.
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. -- john 4:50
.
And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. -- john 4:51
.
Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. -- john 4:52
.
So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. -- john 4:53
.
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. -- john 4:54
.
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. -- john 5:1
.
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. -- john 5:2
.
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. -- john 5:3
.
For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. -- john 5:4
.
And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. -- john 5:5
.
When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? -- john 5:6
.
The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. -- john 5:7
.
Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. -- john 5:8
.
And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. -- john 5:9
.
The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. -- john 5:10
.
He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. -- john 5:11
.
Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? -- john 5:12
.
And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. -- john 5:13
.
Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. -- john 5:14
.
The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. -- john 5:15
.
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. -- john 5:16
.
But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. -- john 5:17
.
Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. -- john 5:18
.
Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. -- john 5:19
.
For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. -- john 5:20
.
For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. -- john 5:21
.
For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: -- john 5:22
.
That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. -- john 5:23
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. -- john 5:24
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. -- john 5:25
.
For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; -- john 5:26
.
And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. -- john 5:27
.
Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, -- john 5:28
.
And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. -- john 5:29
.
I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. -- john 5:30
.
If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. -- john 5:31
.
There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. -- john 5:32
.
Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. -- john 5:33
.
But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. -- john 5:34
.
He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. -- john 5:35
.
But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. -- john 5:36
.
And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. -- john 5:37
.
And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. -- john 5:38
.
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. -- john 5:39
.
And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. -- john 5:40
.
I receive not honour from men. -- john 5:41
.
But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. -- john 5:42
.
I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. -- john 5:43
.
How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? -- john 5:44
.
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. -- john 5:45
.
For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. -- john 5:46
.
But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? -- john 5:47
.
After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. -- john 6:1
.
And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. -- john 6:2
.
And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. -- john 6:3
.
And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. -- john 6:4
.
When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? -- john 6:5
.
And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. -- john 6:6
.
Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. -- john 6:7
.
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, -- john 6:8
.
There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? -- john 6:9
.
And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. -- john 6:10
.
And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. -- john 6:11
.
When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. -- john 6:12
.
Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. -- john 6:13
.
Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. -- john 6:14
.
When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. -- john 6:15
.
And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, -- john 6:16
.
And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. -- john 6:17
.
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. -- john 6:18
.
So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. -- john 6:19
.
But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. -- john 6:20
.
Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went. -- john 6:21
.
The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; -- john 6:22
.
(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) -- john 6:23
.
When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. -- john 6:24
.
And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? -- john 6:25
.
Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. -- john 6:26
.
Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. -- john 6:27
.
Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? -- john 6:28
.
Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. -- john 6:29
.
They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? -- john 6:30
.
Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. -- john 6:31
.
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. -- john 6:32
.
For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. -- john 6:33
.
Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. -- john 6:34
.
And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. -- john 6:35
.
But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. -- john 6:36
.
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. -- john 6:37
.
For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. -- john 6:38
.
And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. -- john 6:39
.
And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. -- john 6:40
.
The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. -- john 6:41
.
And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? -- john 6:42
.
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. -- john 6:43
.
No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. -- john 6:44
.
It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. -- john 6:45
.
Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. -- john 6:46
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. -- john 6:47
.
I am that bread of life. -- john 6:48
.
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. -- john 6:49
.
This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. -- john 6:50
.
I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. -- john 6:51
.
The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? -- john 6:52
.
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. -- john 6:53
.
Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. -- john 6:54
.
For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. -- john 6:55
.
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. -- john 6:56
.
As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. -- john 6:57
.
This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. -- john 6:58
.
These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. -- john 6:59
.
Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? -- john 6:60
.
When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? -- john 6:61
.
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? -- john 6:62
.
It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. -- john 6:63
.
But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. -- john 6:64
.
And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. -- john 6:65
.
From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. -- john 6:66
.
Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? -- john 6:67
.
Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. -- john 6:68
.
And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. -- john 6:69
.
Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? -- john 6:70
.
He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve. -- john 6:71
.
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. -- john 7:1
.
Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand. -- john 7:2
.
His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. -- john 7:3
.
For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. -- john 7:4
.
For neither did his brethren believe in him. -- john 7:5
.
Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. -- john 7:6
.
The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. -- john 7:7
.
Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come. -- john 7:8
.
When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. -- john 7:9
.
But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. -- john 7:10
.
Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? -- john 7:11
.
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. -- john 7:12
.
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. -- john 7:13
.
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. -- john 7:14
.
And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? -- john 7:15
.
Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. -- john 7:16
.
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. -- john 7:17
.
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. -- john 7:18
.
Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? -- john 7:19
.
The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? -- john 7:20
.
Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. -- john 7:21
.
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. -- john 7:22
.
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? -- john 7:23
.
Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. -- john 7:24
.
Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? -- john 7:25
.
But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? -- john 7:26
.
Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. -- john 7:27
.
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. -- john 7:28
.
But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. -- john 7:29
.
Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. -- john 7:30
.
And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? -- john 7:31
.
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. -- john 7:32
.
Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. -- john 7:33
.
Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. -- john 7:34
.
Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? -- john 7:35
.
What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? -- john 7:36
.
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. -- john 7:37
.
He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. -- john 7:38
.
(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) -- john 7:39
.
Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. -- john 7:40
.
Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? -- john 7:41
.
Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? -- john 7:42
.
So there was a division among the people because of him. -- john 7:43
.
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. -- john 7:44
.
Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? -- john 7:45
.
The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. -- john 7:46
.
Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? -- john 7:47
.
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? -- john 7:48
.
But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. -- john 7:49
.
Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) -- john 7:50
.
Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? -- john 7:51
.
They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. -- john 7:52
.
And every man went unto his own house. -- john 7:53
.
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. -- john 8:1
.
And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. -- john 8:2
.
And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, -- john 8:3
.
They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. -- john 8:4
.
Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? -- john 8:5
.
This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. -- john 8:6
.
So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. -- john 8:7
.
And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. -- john 8:8
.
And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. -- john 8:9
.
When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? -- john 8:10
.
She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. -- john 8:11
.
Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. -- john 8:12
.
The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. -- john 8:13
.
Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. -- john 8:14
.
Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. -- john 8:15
.
And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. -- john 8:16
.
It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. -- john 8:17
.
I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. -- john 8:18
.
Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. -- john 8:19
.
These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. -- john 8:20
.
Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. -- john 8:21
.
Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. -- john 8:22
.
And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. -- john 8:23
.
I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. -- john 8:24
.
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. -- john 8:25
.
I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. -- john 8:26
.
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. -- john 8:27
.
Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. -- john 8:28
.
And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. -- john 8:29
.
As he spake these words, many believed on him. -- john 8:30
.
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; -- john 8:31
.
And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. -- john 8:32
.
They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? -- john 8:33
.
Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. -- john 8:34
.
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. -- john 8:35
.
If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. -- john 8:36
.
I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. -- john 8:37
.
I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. -- john 8:38
.
They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. -- john 8:39
.
But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. -- john 8:40
.
Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. -- john 8:41
.
Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. -- john 8:42
.
Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. -- john 8:43
.
Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. -- john 8:44
.
And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. -- john 8:45
.
Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? -- john 8:46
.
He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. -- john 8:47
.
Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? -- john 8:48
.
Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. -- john 8:49
.
And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. -- john 8:50
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. -- john 8:51
.
Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. -- john 8:52
.
Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? -- john 8:53
.
Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: -- john 8:54
.
Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. -- john 8:55
.
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. -- john 8:56
.
Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? -- john 8:57
.
Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. -- john 8:58
.
Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. -- john 8:59
.
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. -- john 9:1
.
And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? -- john 9:2
.
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. -- john 9:3
.
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. -- john 9:4
.
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. -- john 9:5
.
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, -- john 9:6
.
And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. -- john 9:7
.
The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? -- john 9:8
.
Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. -- john 9:9
.
Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? -- john 9:10
.
He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. -- john 9:11
.
Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. -- john 9:12
.
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. -- john 9:13
.
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. -- john 9:14
.
Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. -- john 9:15
.
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. -- john 9:16
.
They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. -- john 9:17
.
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. -- john 9:18
.
And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? -- john 9:19
.
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: -- john 9:20
.
But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. -- john 9:21
.
These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. -- john 9:22
.
Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. -- john 9:23
.
Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. -- john 9:24
.
He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. -- john 9:25
.
Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? -- john 9:26
.
He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? -- john 9:27
.
Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. -- john 9:28
.
We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. -- john 9:29
.
The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. -- john 9:30
.
Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. -- john 9:31
.
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. -- john 9:32
.
If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. -- john 9:33
.
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. -- john 9:34
.
Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? -- john 9:35
.
He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? -- john 9:36
.
And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. -- john 9:37
.
And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. -- john 9:38
.
And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. -- john 9:39
.
And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? -- john 9:40
.
Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. -- john 9:41
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. -- john 10:1
.
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. -- john 10:2
.
To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. -- john 10:3
.
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. -- john 10:4
.
And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. -- john 10:5
.
This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. -- john 10:6
.
Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. -- john 10:7
.
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. -- john 10:8
.
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. -- john 10:9
.
The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. -- john 10:10
.
I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. -- john 10:11
.
But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. -- john 10:12
.
The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. -- john 10:13
.
I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. -- john 10:14
.
As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. -- john 10:15
.
And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. -- john 10:16
.
Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. -- john 10:17
.
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. -- john 10:18
.
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. -- john 10:19
.
And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? -- john 10:20
.
Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? -- john 10:21
.
And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. -- john 10:22
.
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. -- john 10:23
.
Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. -- john 10:24
.
Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. -- john 10:25
.
But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. -- john 10:26
.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: -- john 10:27
.
And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. -- john 10:28
.
My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. -- john 10:29
.
I and my Father are one. -- john 10:30
.
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. -- john 10:31
.
Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? -- john 10:32
.
The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. -- john 10:33
.
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? -- john 10:34
.
If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; -- john 10:35
.
Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? -- john 10:36
.
If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. -- john 10:37
.
But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. -- john 10:38
.
Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, -- john 10:39
.
And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. -- john 10:40
.
And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. -- john 10:41
.
And many believed on him there. -- john 10:42
.
Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. -- john 11:1
.
(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) -- john 11:2
.
Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. -- john 11:3
.
When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. -- john 11:4
.
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. -- john 11:5
.
When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. -- john 11:6
.
Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. -- john 11:7
.
His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? -- john 11:8
.
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. -- john 11:9
.
But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. -- john 11:10
.
These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. -- john 11:11
.
Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. -- john 11:12
.
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. -- john 11:13
.
Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. -- john 11:14
.
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. -- john 11:15
.
Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. -- john 11:16
.
Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. -- john 11:17
.
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: -- john 11:18
.
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. -- john 11:19
.
Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. -- john 11:20
.
Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. -- john 11:21
.
But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. -- john 11:22
.
Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. -- john 11:23
.
Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. -- john 11:24
.
Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: -- john 11:25
.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? -- john 11:26
.
She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. -- john 11:27
.
And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. -- john 11:28
.
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. -- john 11:29
.
Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. -- john 11:30
.
The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. -- john 11:31
.
Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. -- john 11:32
.
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. -- john 11:33
.
And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. -- john 11:34
.
Jesus wept. -- john 11:35
.
Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! -- john 11:36
.
And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? -- john 11:37
.
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. -- john 11:38
.
Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. -- john 11:39
.
Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? -- john 11:40
.
Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. -- john 11:41
.
And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. -- john 11:42
.
And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. -- john 11:43
.
And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. -- john 11:44
.
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. -- john 11:45
.
But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. -- john 11:46
.
Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. -- john 11:47
.
If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. -- john 11:48
.
And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, -- john 11:49
.
Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. -- john 11:50
.
And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; -- john 11:51
.
And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. -- john 11:52
.
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. -- john 11:53
.
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. -- john 11:54
.
And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. -- john 11:55
.
Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? -- john 11:56
.
Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him. -- john 11:57
.
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. -- john 12:1
.
There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. -- john 12:2
.
Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. -- john 12:3
.
Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, -- john 12:4
.
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? -- john 12:5
.
This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. -- john 12:6
.
Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. -- john 12:7
.
For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. -- john 12:8
.
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. -- john 12:9
.
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; -- john 12:10
.
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. -- john 12:11
.
On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, -- john 12:12
.
Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. -- john 12:13
.
And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, -- john 12:14
.
Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. -- john 12:15
.
These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. -- john 12:16
.
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. -- john 12:17
.
For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. -- john 12:18
.
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. -- john 12:19
.
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: -- john 12:20
.
The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. -- john 12:21
.
Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. -- john 12:22
.
And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. -- john 12:23
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. -- john 12:24
.
He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. -- john 12:25
.
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. -- john 12:26
.
Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. -- john 12:27
.
Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. -- john 12:28
.
The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. -- john 12:29
.
Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. -- john 12:30
.
Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. -- john 12:31
.
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. -- john 12:32
.
This he said, signifying what death he should die. -- john 12:33
.
The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? -- john 12:34
.
Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. -- john 12:35
.
While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. -- john 12:36
.
But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: -- john 12:37
.
That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? -- john 12:38
.
Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, -- john 12:39
.
He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. -- john 12:40
.
These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. -- john 12:41
.
Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: -- john 12:42
.
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. -- john 12:43
.
Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. -- john 12:44
.
And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. -- john 12:45
.
I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. -- john 12:46
.
And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. -- john 12:47
.
He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. -- john 12:48
.
For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. -- john 12:49
.
And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. -- john 12:50
.
Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. -- john 13:1
.
And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; -- john 13:2
.
Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; -- john 13:3
.
He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. -- john 13:4
.
After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. -- john 13:5
.
Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? -- john 13:6
.
Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. -- john 13:7
.
Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. -- john 13:8
.
Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. -- john 13:9
.
Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. -- john 13:10
.
For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. -- john 13:11
.
So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? -- john 13:12
.
Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. -- john 13:13
.
If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. -- john 13:14
.
For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. -- john 13:15
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. -- john 13:16
.
If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. -- john 13:17
.
I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. -- john 13:18
.
Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. -- john 13:19
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. -- john 13:20
.
When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. -- john 13:21
.
Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. -- john 13:22
.
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. -- john 13:23
.
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. -- john 13:24
.
He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? -- john 13:25
.
Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. -- john 13:26
.
And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. -- john 13:27
.
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. -- john 13:28
.
For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. -- john 13:29
.
He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night. -- john 13:30
.
Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. -- john 13:31
.
If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. -- john 13:32
.
Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. -- john 13:33
.
A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. -- john 13:34
.
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. -- john 13:35
.
Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. -- john 13:36
.
Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. -- john 13:37
.
Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice. -- john 13:38
.
Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. -- john 14:1
.
In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. -- john 14:2
.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. -- john 14:3
.
And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. -- john 14:4
.
Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? -- john 14:5
.
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- john 14:6
.
If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. -- john 14:7
.
Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. -- john 14:8
.
Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? -- john 14:9
.
Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. -- john 14:10
.
Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake. -- john 14:11
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. -- john 14:12
.
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. -- john 14:13
.
If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. -- john 14:14
.
If ye love me, keep my commandments. -- john 14:15
.
And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; -- john 14:16
.
Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. -- john 14:17
.
I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. -- john 14:18
.
Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. -- john 14:19
.
At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. -- john 14:20
.
He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. -- john 14:21
.
Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? -- john 14:22
.
Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. -- john 14:23
.
He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. -- john 14:24
.
These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. -- john 14:25
.
But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. -- john 14:26
.
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. -- john 14:27
.
Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. -- john 14:28
.
And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. -- john 14:29
.
Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. -- john 14:30
.
But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence. -- john 14:31
.
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. -- john 15:1
.
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. -- john 15:2
.
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. -- john 15:3
.
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. -- john 15:4
.
I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. -- john 15:5
.
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. -- john 15:6
.
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. -- john 15:7
.
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. -- john 15:8
.
As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. -- john 15:9
.
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. -- john 15:10
.
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. -- john 15:11
.
This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. -- john 15:12
.
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. -- john 15:13
.
Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. -- john 15:14
.
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. -- john 15:15
.
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. -- john 15:16
.
These things I command you, that ye love one another. -- john 15:17
.
If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. -- john 15:18
.
If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. -- john 15:19
.
Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. -- john 15:20
.
But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. -- john 15:21
.
If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. -- john 15:22
.
He that hateth me hateth my Father also. -- john 15:23
.
If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. -- john 15:24
.
But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. -- john 15:25
.
But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: -- john 15:26
.
And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning. -- john 15:27
.
These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. -- john 16:1
.
They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. -- john 16:2
.
And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. -- john 16:3
.
But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. -- john 16:4
.
But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? -- john 16:5
.
But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. -- john 16:6
.
Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. -- john 16:7
.
And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: -- john 16:8
.
Of sin, because they believe not on me; -- john 16:9
.
Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; -- john 16:10
.
Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. -- john 16:11
.
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. -- john 16:12
.
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. -- john 16:13
.
He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. -- john 16:14
.
All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. -- john 16:15
.
A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. -- john 16:16
.
Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? -- john 16:17
.
They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. -- john 16:18
.
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? -- john 16:19
.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. -- john 16:20
.
A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. -- john 16:21
.
And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. -- john 16:22
.
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. -- john 16:23
.
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. -- john 16:24
.
These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. -- john 16:25
.
At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: -- john 16:26
.
For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. -- john 16:27
.
I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. -- john 16:28
.
His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. -- john 16:29
.
Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. -- john 16:30
.
Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? -- john 16:31
.
Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. -- john 16:32
.
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. -- john 16:33
.
These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: -- john 17:1
.
As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. -- john 17:2
.
And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. -- john 17:3
.
I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. -- john 17:4
.
And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. -- john 17:5
.
I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. -- john 17:6
.
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. -- john 17:7
.
For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. -- john 17:8
.
I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. -- john 17:9
.
And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. -- john 17:10
.
And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. -- john 17:11
.
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. -- john 17:12
.
And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. -- john 17:13
.
I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. -- john 17:14
.
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. -- john 17:15
.
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. -- john 17:16
.
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. -- john 17:17
.
As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. -- john 17:18
.
And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. -- john 17:19
.
Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; -- john 17:20
.
That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. -- john 17:21
.
And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: -- john 17:22
.
I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. -- john 17:23
.
Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. -- john 17:24
.
O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. -- john 17:25
.
And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. -- john 17:26
.
When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. -- john 18:1
.
And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. -- john 18:2
.
Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. -- john 18:3
.
Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? -- john 18:4
.
They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. -- john 18:5
.
As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. -- john 18:6
.
Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. -- john 18:7
.
Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: -- john 18:8
.
That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none. -- john 18:9
.
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. -- john 18:10
.
Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? -- john 18:11
.
Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, -- john 18:12
.
And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. -- john 18:13
.
Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. -- john 18:14
.
And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. -- john 18:15
.
But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. -- john 18:16
.
Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. -- john 18:17
.
And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. -- john 18:18
.
The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. -- john 18:19
.
Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. -- john 18:20
.
Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. -- john 18:21
.
And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? -- john 18:22
.
Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? -- john 18:23
.
Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. -- john 18:24
.
And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. -- john 18:25
.
One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? -- john 18:26
.
Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew. -- john 18:27
.
Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. -- john 18:28
.
Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? -- john 18:29
.
They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. -- john 18:30
.
Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: -- john 18:31
.
That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. -- john 18:32
.
Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? -- john 18:33
.
Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? -- john 18:34
.
Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? -- john 18:35
.
Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. -- john 18:36
.
Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. -- john 18:37
.
Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. -- john 18:38
.
But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? -- john 18:39
.
Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. -- john 18:40
.
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. -- john 19:1
.
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, -- john 19:2
.
And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. -- john 19:3
.
Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. -- john 19:4
.
Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! -- john 19:5
.
When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. -- john 19:6
.
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. -- john 19:7
.
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; -- john 19:8
.
And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. -- john 19:9
.
Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? -- john 19:10
.
Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. -- john 19:11
.
And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. -- john 19:12
.
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. -- john 19:13
.
And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! -- john 19:14
.
But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. -- john 19:15
.
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. -- john 19:16
.
And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: -- john 19:17
.
Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. -- john 19:18
.
And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. -- john 19:19
.
This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. -- john 19:20
.
Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. -- john 19:21
.
Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. -- john 19:22
.
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. -- john 19:23
.
They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. -- john 19:24
.
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. -- john 19:25
.
When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! -- john 19:26
.
Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. -- john 19:27
.
After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. -- john 19:28
.
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. -- john 19:29
.
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. -- john 19:30
.
The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. -- john 19:31
.
Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. -- john 19:32
.
But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: -- john 19:33
.
But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. -- john 19:34
.
And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. -- john 19:35
.
For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. -- john 19:36
.
And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced. -- john 19:37
.
And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. -- john 19:38
.
And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. -- john 19:39
.
Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. -- john 19:40
.
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. -- john 19:41
.
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand. -- john 19:42
.
The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. -- john 20:1
.
Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. -- john 20:2
.
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. -- john 20:3
.
So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. -- john 20:4
.
And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. -- john 20:5
.
Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, -- john 20:6
.
And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. -- john 20:7
.
Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. -- john 20:8
.
For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. -- john 20:9
.
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. -- john 20:10
.
But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, -- john 20:11
.
And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. -- john 20:12
.
And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him. -- john 20:13
.
And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. -- john 20:14
.
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. -- john 20:15
.
Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. -- john 20:16
.
Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. -- john 20:17
.
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her. -- john 20:18
.
Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. -- john 20:19
.
And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD. -- john 20:20
.
Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. -- john 20:21
.
And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: -- john 20:22
.
Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. -- john 20:23
.
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. -- john 20:24
.
The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. -- john 20:25
.
And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. -- john 20:26
.
Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. -- john 20:27
.
And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God. -- john 20:28
.
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. -- john 20:29
.
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: -- john 20:30
.
But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. -- john 20:31
.
After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. -- john 21:1
.
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. -- john 21:2
.
Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. -- john 21:3
.
But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. -- john 21:4
.
Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. -- john 21:5
.
And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. -- john 21:6
.
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. -- john 21:7
.
And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. -- john 21:8
.
As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. -- john 21:9
.
Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. -- john 21:10
.
Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken. -- john 21:11
.
Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. -- john 21:12
.
Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. -- john 21:13
.
This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. -- john 21:14
.
So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. -- john 21:15
.
He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. -- john 21:16
.
He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. -- john 21:17
.
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. -- john 21:18
.
This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. -- john 21:19
.
Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? -- john 21:20
.
Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? -- john 21:21
.
Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. -- john 21:22
.
Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? -- john 21:23
.
This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. -- john 21:24
.
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen. -- john 21:25
.
The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, -- acts 1:1
.
Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen: -- acts 1:2
.
To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: -- acts 1:3
.
And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. -- acts 1:4
.
For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. -- acts 1:5
.
When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? -- acts 1:6
.
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. -- acts 1:7
.
But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. -- acts 1:8
.
And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. -- acts 1:9
.
And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; -- acts 1:10
.
Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. -- acts 1:11
.
Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. -- acts 1:12
.
And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. -- acts 1:13
.
These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. -- acts 1:14
.
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) -- acts 1:15
.
Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. -- acts 1:16
.
For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. -- acts 1:17
.
Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. -- acts 1:18
.
And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. -- acts 1:19
.
For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take. -- acts 1:20
.
Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, -- acts 1:21
.
Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection. -- acts 1:22
.
And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. -- acts 1:23
.
And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, -- acts 1:24
.
That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. -- acts 1:25
.
And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. -- acts 1:26
.
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. -- acts 2:1
.
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. -- acts 2:2
.
And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. -- acts 2:3
.
And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. -- acts 2:4
.
And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. -- acts 2:5
.
Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. -- acts 2:6
.
And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? -- acts 2:7
.
And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? -- acts 2:8
.
Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, -- acts 2:9
.
Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, -- acts 2:10
.
Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. -- acts 2:11
.
And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? -- acts 2:12
.
Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. -- acts 2:13
.
But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: -- acts 2:14
.
For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. -- acts 2:15
.
But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; -- acts 2:16
.
And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: -- acts 2:17
.
And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: -- acts 2:18
.
And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: -- acts 2:19
.
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come: -- acts 2:20
.
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. -- acts 2:21
.
Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: -- acts 2:22
.
Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: -- acts 2:23
.
Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. -- acts 2:24
.
For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: -- acts 2:25
.
Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: -- acts 2:26
.
Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. -- acts 2:27
.
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. -- acts 2:28
.
Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. -- acts 2:29
.
Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; -- acts 2:30
.
He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. -- acts 2:31
.
This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. -- acts 2:32
.
Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. -- acts 2:33
.
For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, -- acts 2:34
.
Until I make thy foes thy footstool. -- acts 2:35
.
Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. -- acts 2:36
.
Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? -- acts 2:37
.
Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. -- acts 2:38
.
For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call. -- acts 2:39
.
And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. -- acts 2:40
.
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. -- acts 2:41
.
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. -- acts 2:42
.
And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. -- acts 2:43
.
And all that believed were together, and had all things common; -- acts 2:44
.
And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. -- acts 2:45
.
And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, -- acts 2:46
.
Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. -- acts 2:47
.
Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. -- acts 3:1
.
And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; -- acts 3:2
.
Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. -- acts 3:3
.
And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. -- acts 3:4
.
And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. -- acts 3:5
.
Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. -- acts 3:6
.
And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. -- acts 3:7
.
And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. -- acts 3:8
.
And all the people saw him walking and praising God: -- acts 3:9
.
And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. -- acts 3:10
.
And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. -- acts 3:11
.
And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? -- acts 3:12
.
The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. -- acts 3:13
.
But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; -- acts 3:14
.
And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. -- acts 3:15
.
And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. -- acts 3:16
.
And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. -- acts 3:17
.
But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. -- acts 3:18
.
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. -- acts 3:19
.
And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: -- acts 3:20
.
Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. -- acts 3:21
.
For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. -- acts 3:22
.
And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. -- acts 3:23
.
Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. -- acts 3:24
.
Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. -- acts 3:25
.
Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. -- acts 3:26
.
And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, -- acts 4:1
.
Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. -- acts 4:2
.
And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide. -- acts 4:3
.
Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand. -- acts 4:4
.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, -- acts 4:5
.
And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. -- acts 4:6
.
And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? -- acts 4:7
.
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, -- acts 4:8
.
If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; -- acts 4:9
.
Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. -- acts 4:10
.
This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. -- acts 4:11
.
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. -- acts 4:12
.
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. -- acts 4:13
.
And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. -- acts 4:14
.
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, -- acts 4:15
.
Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. -- acts 4:16
.
But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. -- acts 4:17
.
And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. -- acts 4:18
.
But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. -- acts 4:19
.
For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. -- acts 4:20
.
So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. -- acts 4:21
.
For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. -- acts 4:22
.
And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. -- acts 4:23
.
And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: -- acts 4:24
.
Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? -- acts 4:25
.
The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. -- acts 4:26
.
For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, -- acts 4:27
.
For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. -- acts 4:28
.
And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, -- acts 4:29
.
By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. -- acts 4:30
.
And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. -- acts 4:31
.
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. -- acts 4:32
.
And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. -- acts 4:33
.
Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, -- acts 4:34
.
And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. -- acts 4:35
.
And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, -- acts 4:36
.
Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet. -- acts 4:37
.
But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, -- acts 5:1
.
And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. -- acts 5:2
.
But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? -- acts 5:3
.
Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. -- acts 5:4
.
And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things. -- acts 5:5
.
And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him. -- acts 5:6
.
And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. -- acts 5:7
.
And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. -- acts 5:8
.
Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. -- acts 5:9
.
Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. -- acts 5:10
.
And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things. -- acts 5:11
.
And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. -- acts 5:12
.
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them. -- acts 5:13
.
And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) -- acts 5:14
.
Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. -- acts 5:15
.
There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. -- acts 5:16
.
Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation, -- acts 5:17
.
And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. -- acts 5:18
.
But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, -- acts 5:19
.
Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. -- acts 5:20
.
And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. -- acts 5:21
.
But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told, -- acts 5:22
.
Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. -- acts 5:23
.
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow. -- acts 5:24
.
Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. -- acts 5:25
.
Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned. -- acts 5:26
.
And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, -- acts 5:27
.
Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. -- acts 5:28
.
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. -- acts 5:29
.
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. -- acts 5:30
.
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. -- acts 5:31
.
And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. -- acts 5:32
.
When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them. -- acts 5:33
.
Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; -- acts 5:34
.
And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. -- acts 5:35
.
For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. -- acts 5:36
.
After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. -- acts 5:37
.
And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: -- acts 5:38
.
But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. -- acts 5:39
.
And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. -- acts 5:40
.
And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. -- acts 5:41
.
And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. -- acts 5:42
.
And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. -- acts 6:1
.
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. -- acts 6:2
.
Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. -- acts 6:3
.
But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. -- acts 6:4
.
And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: -- acts 6:5
.
Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. -- acts 6:6
.
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. -- acts 6:7
.
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. -- acts 6:8
.
Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. -- acts 6:9
.
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. -- acts 6:10
.
Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. -- acts 6:11
.
And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, -- acts 6:12
.
And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: -- acts 6:13
.
For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. -- acts 6:14
.
And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. -- acts 6:15
.
Then said the high priest, Are these things so? -- acts 7:1
.
And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, -- acts 7:2
.
And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. -- acts 7:3
.
Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. -- acts 7:4
.
And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. -- acts 7:5
.
And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. -- acts 7:6
.
And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. -- acts 7:7
.
And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs. -- acts 7:8
.
And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, -- acts 7:9
.
And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. -- acts 7:10
.
Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. -- acts 7:11
.
But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. -- acts 7:12
.
And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh. -- acts 7:13
.
Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. -- acts 7:14
.
So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, -- acts 7:15
.
And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. -- acts 7:16
.
But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, -- acts 7:17
.
Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph. -- acts 7:18
.
The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. -- acts 7:19
.
In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months: -- acts 7:20
.
And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. -- acts 7:21
.
And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. -- acts 7:22
.
And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. -- acts 7:23
.
And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: -- acts 7:24
.
For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not. -- acts 7:25
.
And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? -- acts 7:26
.
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? -- acts 7:27
.
Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? -- acts 7:28
.
Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons. -- acts 7:29
.
And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. -- acts 7:30
.
When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him, -- acts 7:31
.
Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. -- acts 7:32
.
Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. -- acts 7:33
.
I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt. -- acts 7:34
.
This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. -- acts 7:35
.
He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. -- acts 7:36
.
This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. -- acts 7:37
.
This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us: -- acts 7:38
.
To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, -- acts 7:39
.
Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. -- acts 7:40
.
And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. -- acts 7:41
.
Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? -- acts 7:42
.
Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon. -- acts 7:43
.
Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. -- acts 7:44
.
Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; -- acts 7:45
.
Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. -- acts 7:46
.
But Solomon built him an house. -- acts 7:47
.
Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, -- acts 7:48
.
Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? -- acts 7:49
.
Hath not my hand made all these things? -- acts 7:50
.
Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. -- acts 7:51
.
Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: -- acts 7:52
.
Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it. -- acts 7:53
.
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. -- acts 7:54
.
But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, -- acts 7:55
.
And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. -- acts 7:56
.
Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, -- acts 7:57
.
And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul. -- acts 7:58
.
And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. -- acts 7:59
.
And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. -- acts 7:60
.
And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. -- acts 8:1
.
And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. -- acts 8:2
.
As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. -- acts 8:3
.
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. -- acts 8:4
.
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. -- acts 8:5
.
And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. -- acts 8:6
.
For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. -- acts 8:7
.
And there was great joy in that city. -- acts 8:8
.
But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: -- acts 8:9
.
To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. -- acts 8:10
.
And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. -- acts 8:11
.
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. -- acts 8:12
.
Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. -- acts 8:13
.
Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: -- acts 8:14
.
Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: -- acts 8:15
.
(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) -- acts 8:16
.
Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. -- acts 8:17
.
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, -- acts 8:18
.
Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. -- acts 8:19
.
But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. -- acts 8:20
.
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. -- acts 8:21
.
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. -- acts 8:22
.
For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. -- acts 8:23
.
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. -- acts 8:24
.
And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. -- acts 8:25
.
And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. -- acts 8:26
.
And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, -- acts 8:27
.
Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. -- acts 8:28
.
Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. -- acts 8:29
.
And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? -- acts 8:30
.
And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. -- acts 8:31
.
The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: -- acts 8:32
.
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. -- acts 8:33
.
And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? -- acts 8:34
.
Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. -- acts 8:35
.
And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? -- acts 8:36
.
And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. -- acts 8:37
.
And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. -- acts 8:38
.
And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. -- acts 8:39
.
But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. -- acts 8:40
.
And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, -- acts 9:1
.
And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. -- acts 9:2
.
And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: -- acts 9:3
.
And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? -- acts 9:4
.
And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. -- acts 9:5
.
And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. -- acts 9:6
.
And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. -- acts 9:7
.
And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. -- acts 9:8
.
And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink. -- acts 9:9
.
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. -- acts 9:10
.
And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, -- acts 9:11
.
And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. -- acts 9:12
.
Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: -- acts 9:13
.
And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. -- acts 9:14
.
But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: -- acts 9:15
.
For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake. -- acts 9:16
.
And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. -- acts 9:17
.
And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. -- acts 9:18
.
And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. -- acts 9:19
.
And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. -- acts 9:20
.
But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests? -- acts 9:21
.
But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. -- acts 9:22
.
And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him: -- acts 9:23
.
But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him. -- acts 9:24
.
Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket. -- acts 9:25
.
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. -- acts 9:26
.
But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. -- acts 9:27
.
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. -- acts 9:28
.
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. -- acts 9:29
.
Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. -- acts 9:30
.
Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. -- acts 9:31
.
And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. -- acts 9:32
.
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. -- acts 9:33
.
And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. -- acts 9:34
.
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord. -- acts 9:35
.
Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. -- acts 9:36
.
And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. -- acts 9:37
.
And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. -- acts 9:38
.
Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. -- acts 9:39
.
But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. -- acts 9:40
.
And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive. -- acts 9:41
.
And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. -- acts 9:42
.
And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner. -- acts 9:43
.
There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, -- acts 10:1
.
A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. -- acts 10:2
.
He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. -- acts 10:3
.
And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. -- acts 10:4
.
And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: -- acts 10:5
.
He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. -- acts 10:6
.
And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; -- acts 10:7
.
And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. -- acts 10:8
.
On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: -- acts 10:9
.
And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, -- acts 10:10
.
And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: -- acts 10:11
.
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. -- acts 10:12
.
And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. -- acts 10:13
.
But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. -- acts 10:14
.
And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. -- acts 10:15
.
This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. -- acts 10:16
.
Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, -- acts 10:17
.
And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. -- acts 10:18
.
While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. -- acts 10:19
.
Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. -- acts 10:20
.
Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? -- acts 10:21
.
And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. -- acts 10:22
.
Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. -- acts 10:23
.
And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends. -- acts 10:24
.
And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. -- acts 10:25
.
But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. -- acts 10:26
.
And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. -- acts 10:27
.
And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. -- acts 10:28
.
Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? -- acts 10:29
.
And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, -- acts 10:30
.
And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. -- acts 10:31
.
Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. -- acts 10:32
.
Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. -- acts 10:33
.
Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: -- acts 10:34
.
But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. -- acts 10:35
.
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) -- acts 10:36
.
That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; -- acts 10:37
.
How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. -- acts 10:38
.
And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: -- acts 10:39
.
Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; -- acts 10:40
.
Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. -- acts 10:41
.
And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. -- acts 10:42
.
To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. -- acts 10:43
.
While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. -- acts 10:44
.
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. -- acts 10:45
.
For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, -- acts 10:46
.
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? -- acts 10:47
.
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. -- acts 10:48
.
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. -- acts 11:1
.
And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, -- acts 11:2
.
Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. -- acts 11:3
.
But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying, -- acts 11:4
.
I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me: -- acts 11:5
.
Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. -- acts 11:6
.
And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. -- acts 11:7
.
But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. -- acts 11:8
.
But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. -- acts 11:9
.
And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven. -- acts 11:10
.
And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. -- acts 11:11
.
And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house: -- acts 11:12
.
And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter; -- acts 11:13
.
Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved. -- acts 11:14
.
And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. -- acts 11:15
.
Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. -- acts 11:16
.
Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God? -- acts 11:17
.
When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. -- acts 11:18
.
Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. -- acts 11:19
.
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus. -- acts 11:20
.
And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord. -- acts 11:21
.
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. -- acts 11:22
.
Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. -- acts 11:23
.
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. -- acts 11:24
.
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: -- acts 11:25
.
And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. -- acts 11:26
.
And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. -- acts 11:27
.
And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. -- acts 11:28
.
Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea: -- acts 11:29
.
Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. -- acts 11:30
.
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. -- acts 12:1
.
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. -- acts 12:2
.
And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) -- acts 12:3
.
And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. -- acts 12:4
.
Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. -- acts 12:5
.
And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. -- acts 12:6
.
And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. -- acts 12:7
.
And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. -- acts 12:8
.
And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. -- acts 12:9
.
When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. -- acts 12:10
.
And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. -- acts 12:11
.
And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying. -- acts 12:12
.
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. -- acts 12:13
.
And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. -- acts 12:14
.
And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. -- acts 12:15
.
But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished. -- acts 12:16
.
But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. -- acts 12:17
.
Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. -- acts 12:18
.
And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode. -- acts 12:19
.
And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country. -- acts 12:20
.
And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. -- acts 12:21
.
And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. -- acts 12:22
.
And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost. -- acts 12:23
.
But the word of God grew and multiplied. -- acts 12:24
.
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark. -- acts 12:25
.
Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. -- acts 13:1
.
As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. -- acts 13:2
.
And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. -- acts 13:3
.
So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. -- acts 13:4
.
And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister. -- acts 13:5
.
And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus: -- acts 13:6
.
Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. -- acts 13:7
.
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. -- acts 13:8
.
Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him. -- acts 13:9
.
And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? -- acts 13:10
.
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. -- acts 13:11
.
Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. -- acts 13:12
.
Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem. -- acts 13:13
.
But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. -- acts 13:14
.
And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. -- acts 13:15
.
Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. -- acts 13:16
.
The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. -- acts 13:17
.
And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness. -- acts 13:18
.
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. -- acts 13:19
.
And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. -- acts 13:20
.
And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. -- acts 13:21
.
And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. -- acts 13:22
.
Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: -- acts 13:23
.
When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. -- acts 13:24
.
And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose. -- acts 13:25
.
Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. -- acts 13:26
.
For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. -- acts 13:27
.
And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. -- acts 13:28
.
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. -- acts 13:29
.
But God raised him from the dead: -- acts 13:30
.
And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. -- acts 13:31
.
And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, -- acts 13:32
.
God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. -- acts 13:33
.
And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. -- acts 13:34
.
Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. -- acts 13:35
.
For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: -- acts 13:36
.
But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. -- acts 13:37
.
Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: -- acts 13:38
.
And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. -- acts 13:39
.
Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; -- acts 13:40
.
Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you. -- acts 13:41
.
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. -- acts 13:42
.
Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. -- acts 13:43
.
And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. -- acts 13:44
.
But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. -- acts 13:45
.
Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. -- acts 13:46
.
For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. -- acts 13:47
.
And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. -- acts 13:48
.
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. -- acts 13:49
.
But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. -- acts 13:50
.
But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. -- acts 13:51
.
And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost. -- acts 13:52
.
And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. -- acts 14:1
.
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. -- acts 14:2
.
Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. -- acts 14:3
.
But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. -- acts 14:4
.
And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, -- acts 14:5
.
They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: -- acts 14:6
.
And there they preached the gospel. -- acts 14:7
.
And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: -- acts 14:8
.
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, -- acts 14:9
.
Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. -- acts 14:10
.
And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. -- acts 14:11
.
And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. -- acts 14:12
.
Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. -- acts 14:13
.
Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, -- acts 14:14
.
And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: -- acts 14:15
.
Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. -- acts 14:16
.
Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. -- acts 14:17
.
And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them. -- acts 14:18
.
And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. -- acts 14:19
.
Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. -- acts 14:20
.
And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, -- acts 14:21
.
Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. -- acts 14:22
.
And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. -- acts 14:23
.
And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. -- acts 14:24
.
And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia: -- acts 14:25
.
And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. -- acts 14:26
.
And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. -- acts 14:27
.
And there they abode long time with the disciples. -- acts 14:28
.
And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. -- acts 15:1
.
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. -- acts 15:2
.
And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. -- acts 15:3
.
And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. -- acts 15:4
.
But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. -- acts 15:5
.
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. -- acts 15:6
.
And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. -- acts 15:7
.
And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; -- acts 15:8
.
And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. -- acts 15:9
.
Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? -- acts 15:10
.
But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. -- acts 15:11
.
Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. -- acts 15:12
.
And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: -- acts 15:13
.
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. -- acts 15:14
.
And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, -- acts 15:15
.
After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: -- acts 15:16
.
That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. -- acts 15:17
.
Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. -- acts 15:18
.
Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: -- acts 15:19
.
But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. -- acts 15:20
.
For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. -- acts 15:21
.
Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren: -- acts 15:22
.
And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. -- acts 15:23
.
Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: -- acts 15:24
.
It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, -- acts 15:25
.
Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- acts 15:26
.
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. -- acts 15:27
.
For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; -- acts 15:28
.
That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. -- acts 15:29
.
So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: -- acts 15:30
.
Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. -- acts 15:31
.
And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. -- acts 15:32
.
And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. -- acts 15:33
.
Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. -- acts 15:34
.
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. -- acts 15:35
.
And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do. -- acts 15:36
.
And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. -- acts 15:37
.
But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. -- acts 15:38
.
And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; -- acts 15:39
.
And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. -- acts 15:40
.
And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. -- acts 15:41
.
Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: -- acts 16:1
.
Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. -- acts 16:2
.
Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. -- acts 16:3
.
And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. -- acts 16:4
.
And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. -- acts 16:5
.
Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, -- acts 16:6
.
After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. -- acts 16:7
.
And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. -- acts 16:8
.
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. -- acts 16:9
.
And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. -- acts 16:10
.
Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; -- acts 16:11
.
And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. -- acts 16:12
.
And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither. -- acts 16:13
.
And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. -- acts 16:14
.
And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. -- acts 16:15
.
And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: -- acts 16:16
.
The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. -- acts 16:17
.
And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. -- acts 16:18
.
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, -- acts 16:19
.
And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, -- acts 16:20
.
And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. -- acts 16:21
.
And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them. -- acts 16:22
.
And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: -- acts 16:23
.
Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. -- acts 16:24
.
And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. -- acts 16:25
.
And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. -- acts 16:26
.
And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. -- acts 16:27
.
But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. -- acts 16:28
.
Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, -- acts 16:29
.
And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? -- acts 16:30
.
And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. -- acts 16:31
.
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. -- acts 16:32
.
And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. -- acts 16:33
.
And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. -- acts 16:34
.
And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go. -- acts 16:35
.
And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. -- acts 16:36
.
But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. -- acts 16:37
.
And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. -- acts 16:38
.
And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city. -- acts 16:39
.
And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. -- acts 16:40
.
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: -- acts 17:1
.
And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, -- acts 17:2
.
Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. -- acts 17:3
.
And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. -- acts 17:4
.
But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. -- acts 17:5
.
And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; -- acts 17:6
.
Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. -- acts 17:7
.
And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. -- acts 17:8
.
And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go. -- acts 17:9
.
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. -- acts 17:10
.
These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. -- acts 17:11
.
Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. -- acts 17:12
.
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people. -- acts 17:13
.
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. -- acts 17:14
.
And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed. -- acts 17:15
.
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. -- acts 17:16
.
Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. -- acts 17:17
.
Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. -- acts 17:18
.
And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? -- acts 17:19
.
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. -- acts 17:20
.
(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.) -- acts 17:21
.
Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. -- acts 17:22
.
For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. -- acts 17:23
.
God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; -- acts 17:24
.
Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; -- acts 17:25
.
And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; -- acts 17:26
.
That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: -- acts 17:27
.
For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. -- acts 17:28
.
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. -- acts 17:29
.
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: -- acts 17:30
.
Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. -- acts 17:31
.
And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter. -- acts 17:32
.
So Paul departed from among them. -- acts 17:33
.
Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. -- acts 17:34
.
After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; -- acts 18:1
.
And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. -- acts 18:2
.
And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. -- acts 18:3
.
And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. -- acts 18:4
.
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. -- acts 18:5
.
And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. -- acts 18:6
.
And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. -- acts 18:7
.
And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. -- acts 18:8
.
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: -- acts 18:9
.
For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. -- acts 18:10
.
And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. -- acts 18:11
.
And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, -- acts 18:12
.
Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. -- acts 18:13
.
And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: -- acts 18:14
.
But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. -- acts 18:15
.
And he drave them from the judgment seat. -- acts 18:16
.
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. -- acts 18:17
.
And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. -- acts 18:18
.
And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. -- acts 18:19
.
When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; -- acts 18:20
.
But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. -- acts 18:21
.
And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. -- acts 18:22
.
And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. -- acts 18:23
.
And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. -- acts 18:24
.
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. -- acts 18:25
.
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. -- acts 18:26
.
And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: -- acts 18:27
.
For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. -- acts 18:28
.
And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, -- acts 19:1
.
He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. -- acts 19:2
.
And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. -- acts 19:3
.
Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. -- acts 19:4
.
When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. -- acts 19:5
.
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. -- acts 19:6
.
And all the men were about twelve. -- acts 19:7
.
And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. -- acts 19:8
.
But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. -- acts 19:9
.
And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. -- acts 19:10
.
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: -- acts 19:11
.
So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. -- acts 19:12
.
Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. -- acts 19:13
.
And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. -- acts 19:14
.
And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? -- acts 19:15
.
And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. -- acts 19:16
.
And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. -- acts 19:17
.
And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. -- acts 19:18
.
Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. -- acts 19:19
.
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. -- acts 19:20
.
After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. -- acts 19:21
.
So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season. -- acts 19:22
.
And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. -- acts 19:23
.
For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; -- acts 19:24
.
Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. -- acts 19:25
.
Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: -- acts 19:26
.
So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. -- acts 19:27
.
And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. -- acts 19:28
.
And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre. -- acts 19:29
.
And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. -- acts 19:30
.
And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre. -- acts 19:31
.
Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. -- acts 19:32
.
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. -- acts 19:33
.
But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. -- acts 19:34
.
And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? -- acts 19:35
.
Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. -- acts 19:36
.
For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. -- acts 19:37
.
Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another. -- acts 19:38
.
But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. -- acts 19:39
.
For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse. -- acts 19:40
.
And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly. -- acts 19:41
.
And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. -- acts 20:1
.
And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, -- acts 20:2
.
And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. -- acts 20:3
.
And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. -- acts 20:4
.
These going before tarried for us at Troas. -- acts 20:5
.
And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. -- acts 20:6
.
And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. -- acts 20:7
.
And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. -- acts 20:8
.
And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. -- acts 20:9
.
And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. -- acts 20:10
.
When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. -- acts 20:11
.
And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted. -- acts 20:12
.
And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. -- acts 20:13
.
And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. -- acts 20:14
.
And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. -- acts 20:15
.
For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. -- acts 20:16
.
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. -- acts 20:17
.
And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, -- acts 20:18
.
Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: -- acts 20:19
.
And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, -- acts 20:20
.
Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. -- acts 20:21
.
And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: -- acts 20:22
.
Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. -- acts 20:23
.
But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. -- acts 20:24
.
And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. -- acts 20:25
.
Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. -- acts 20:26
.
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. -- acts 20:27
.
Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. -- acts 20:28
.
For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. -- acts 20:29
.
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. -- acts 20:30
.
Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. -- acts 20:31
.
And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. -- acts 20:32
.
I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. -- acts 20:33
.
Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. -- acts 20:34
.
I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. -- acts 20:35
.
And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. -- acts 20:36
.
And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, -- acts 20:37
.
Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship. -- acts 20:38
.
And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: -- acts 21:1
.
And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth. -- acts 21:2
.
Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. -- acts 21:3
.
And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. -- acts 21:4
.
And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed. -- acts 21:5
.
And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again. -- acts 21:6
.
And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. -- acts 21:7
.
And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. -- acts 21:8
.
And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy. -- acts 21:9
.
And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. -- acts 21:10
.
And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. -- acts 21:11
.
And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. -- acts 21:12
.
Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. -- acts 21:13
.
And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. -- acts 21:14
.
And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem. -- acts 21:15
.
There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. -- acts 21:16
.
And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. -- acts 21:17
.
And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. -- acts 21:18
.
And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. -- acts 21:19
.
And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: -- acts 21:20
.
And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. -- acts 21:21
.
What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. -- acts 21:22
.
Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; -- acts 21:23
.
Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. -- acts 21:24
.
As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication. -- acts 21:25
.
Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them. -- acts 21:26
.
And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, -- acts 21:27
.
Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place. -- acts 21:28
.
(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.) -- acts 21:29
.
And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut. -- acts 21:30
.
And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. -- acts 21:31
.
Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. -- acts 21:32
.
Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. -- acts 21:33
.
And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. -- acts 21:34
.
And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. -- acts 21:35
.
For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him. -- acts 21:36
.
And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? -- acts 21:37
.
Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? -- acts 21:38
.
But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. -- acts 21:39
.
And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, -- acts 21:40
.
Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you. -- acts 22:1
.
(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,) -- acts 22:2
.
I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. -- acts 22:3
.
And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. -- acts 22:4
.
As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished. -- acts 22:5
.
And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. -- acts 22:6
.
And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? -- acts 22:7
.
And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. -- acts 22:8
.
And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. -- acts 22:9
.
And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. -- acts 22:10
.
And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. -- acts 22:11
.
And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, -- acts 22:12
.
Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. -- acts 22:13
.
And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. -- acts 22:14
.
For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. -- acts 22:15
.
And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. -- acts 22:16
.
And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; -- acts 22:17
.
And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. -- acts 22:18
.
And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: -- acts 22:19
.
And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him. -- acts 22:20
.
And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles. -- acts 22:21
.
And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. -- acts 22:22
.
And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air, -- acts 22:23
.
The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. -- acts 22:24
.
And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? -- acts 22:25
.
When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman. -- acts 22:26
.
Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. -- acts 22:27
.
And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born. -- acts 22:28
.
Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. -- acts 22:29
.
On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them. -- acts 22:30
.
And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day. -- acts 23:1
.
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. -- acts 23:2
.
Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? -- acts 23:3
.
And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? -- acts 23:4
.
Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people. -- acts 23:5
.
But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question. -- acts 23:6
.
And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. -- acts 23:7
.
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. -- acts 23:8
.
And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God. -- acts 23:9
.
And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle. -- acts 23:10
.
And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome. -- acts 23:11
.
And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. -- acts 23:12
.
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. -- acts 23:13
.
And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. -- acts 23:14
.
Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him. -- acts 23:15
.
And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. -- acts 23:16
.
Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him. -- acts 23:17
.
So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee. -- acts 23:18
.
Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me? -- acts 23:19
.
And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly. -- acts 23:20
.
But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee. -- acts 23:21
.
So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me. -- acts 23:22
.
And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; -- acts 23:23
.
And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor. -- acts 23:24
.
And he wrote a letter after this manner: -- acts 23:25
.
Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting. -- acts 23:26
.
This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman. -- acts 23:27
.
And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council: -- acts 23:28
.
Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. -- acts 23:29
.
And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell. -- acts 23:30
.
Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. -- acts 23:31
.
On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: -- acts 23:32
.
Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him. -- acts 23:33
.
And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; -- acts 23:34
.
I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall. -- acts 23:35
.
And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. -- acts 24:1
.
And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, -- acts 24:2
.
We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. -- acts 24:3
.
Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. -- acts 24:4
.
For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: -- acts 24:5
.
Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. -- acts 24:6
.
But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, -- acts 24:7
.
Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. -- acts 24:8
.
And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. -- acts 24:9
.
Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: -- acts 24:10
.
Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. -- acts 24:11
.
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: -- acts 24:12
.
Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. -- acts 24:13
.
But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: -- acts 24:14
.
And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. -- acts 24:15
.
And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men. -- acts 24:16
.
Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. -- acts 24:17
.
Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. -- acts 24:18
.
Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. -- acts 24:19
.
Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, -- acts 24:20
.
Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day. -- acts 24:21
.
And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. -- acts 24:22
.
And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him. -- acts 24:23
.
And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. -- acts 24:24
.
And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. -- acts 24:25
.
He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. -- acts 24:26
.
But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. -- acts 24:27
.
Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. -- acts 25:1
.
Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, -- acts 25:2
.
And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. -- acts 25:3
.
But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither. -- acts 25:4
.
Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him. -- acts 25:5
.
And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought. -- acts 25:6
.
And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. -- acts 25:7
.
While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all. -- acts 25:8
.
But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? -- acts 25:9
.
Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. -- acts 25:10
.
For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar. -- acts 25:11
.
Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go. -- acts 25:12
.
And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus. -- acts 25:13
.
And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: -- acts 25:14
.
About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him. -- acts 25:15
.
To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. -- acts 25:16
.
Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth. -- acts 25:17
.
Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed: -- acts 25:18
.
But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. -- acts 25:19
.
And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters. -- acts 25:20
.
But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar. -- acts 25:21
.
Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. -- acts 25:22
.
And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth. -- acts 25:23
.
And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. -- acts 25:24
.
But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. -- acts 25:25
.
Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. -- acts 25:26
.
For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him. -- acts 25:27
.
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: -- acts 26:1
.
I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: -- acts 26:2
.
Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. -- acts 26:3
.
My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; -- acts 26:4
.
Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. -- acts 26:5
.
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers: -- acts 26:6
.
Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. -- acts 26:7
.
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? -- acts 26:8
.
I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. -- acts 26:9
.
Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. -- acts 26:10
.
And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. -- acts 26:11
.
Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, -- acts 26:12
.
At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. -- acts 26:13
.
And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. -- acts 26:14
.
And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. -- acts 26:15
.
But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; -- acts 26:16
.
Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, -- acts 26:17
.
To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. -- acts 26:18
.
Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: -- acts 26:19
.
But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. -- acts 26:20
.
For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. -- acts 26:21
.
Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: -- acts 26:22
.
That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. -- acts 26:23
.
And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. -- acts 26:24
.
But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. -- acts 26:25
.
For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. -- acts 26:26
.
King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. -- acts 26:27
.
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. -- acts 26:28
.
And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. -- acts 26:29
.
And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: -- acts 26:30
.
And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. -- acts 26:31
.
Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar. -- acts 26:32
.
And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. -- acts 27:1
.
And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. -- acts 27:2
.
And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. -- acts 27:3
.
And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. -- acts 27:4
.
And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. -- acts 27:5
.
And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein. -- acts 27:6
.
And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; -- acts 27:7
.
And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. -- acts 27:8
.
Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, -- acts 27:9
.
And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. -- acts 27:10
.
Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. -- acts 27:11
.
And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west. -- acts 27:12
.
And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete. -- acts 27:13
.
But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. -- acts 27:14
.
And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. -- acts 27:15
.
And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat: -- acts 27:16
.
Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven. -- acts 27:17
.
And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship; -- acts 27:18
.
And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. -- acts 27:19
.
And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away. -- acts 27:20
.
But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss. -- acts 27:21
.
And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. -- acts 27:22
.
For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, -- acts 27:23
.
Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. -- acts 27:24
.
Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. -- acts 27:25
.
Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. -- acts 27:26
.
But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; -- acts 27:27
.
And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. -- acts 27:28
.
Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. -- acts 27:29
.
And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, -- acts 27:30
.
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. -- acts 27:31
.
Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off. -- acts 27:32
.
And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. -- acts 27:33
.
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. -- acts 27:34
.
And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. -- acts 27:35
.
Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat. -- acts 27:36
.
And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. -- acts 27:37
.
And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. -- acts 27:38
.
And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. -- acts 27:39
.
And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. -- acts 27:40
.
And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. -- acts 27:41
.
And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. -- acts 27:42
.
But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land: -- acts 27:43
.
And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land. -- acts 27:44
.
And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. -- acts 28:1
.
And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. -- acts 28:2
.
And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. -- acts 28:3
.
And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. -- acts 28:4
.
And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. -- acts 28:5
.
Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. -- acts 28:6
.
In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. -- acts 28:7
.
And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. -- acts 28:8
.
So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: -- acts 28:9
.
Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. -- acts 28:10
.
And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. -- acts 28:11
.
And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. -- acts 28:12
.
And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: -- acts 28:13
.
Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. -- acts 28:14
.
And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. -- acts 28:15
.
And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. -- acts 28:16
.
And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. -- acts 28:17
.
Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. -- acts 28:18
.
But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. -- acts 28:19
.
For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. -- acts 28:20
.
And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. -- acts 28:21
.
But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. -- acts 28:22
.
And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. -- acts 28:23
.
And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. -- acts 28:24
.
And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, -- acts 28:25
.
Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: -- acts 28:26
.
For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. -- acts 28:27
.
Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. -- acts 28:28
.
And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. -- acts 28:29
.
And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, -- acts 28:30
.
Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. -- acts 28:31
.
Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, -- romans 1:1
.
(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) -- romans 1:2
.
Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; -- romans 1:3
.
And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: -- romans 1:4
.
By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: -- romans 1:5
.
Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: -- romans 1:6
.
To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- romans 1:7
.
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. -- romans 1:8
.
For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; -- romans 1:9
.
Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. -- romans 1:10
.
For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; -- romans 1:11
.
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. -- romans 1:12
.
Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. -- romans 1:13
.
I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. -- romans 1:14
.
So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. -- romans 1:15
.
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. -- romans 1:16
.
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. -- romans 1:17
.
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; -- romans 1:18
.
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. -- romans 1:19
.
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: -- romans 1:20
.
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. -- romans 1:21
.
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, -- romans 1:22
.
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. -- romans 1:23
.
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: -- romans 1:24
.
Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. -- romans 1:25
.
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: -- romans 1:26
.
And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. -- romans 1:27
.
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; -- romans 1:28
.
Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, -- romans 1:29
.
Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, -- romans 1:30
.
Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: -- romans 1:31
.
Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. -- romans 1:32
.
Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. -- romans 2:1
.
But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. -- romans 2:2
.
And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? -- romans 2:3
.
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? -- romans 2:4
.
But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; -- romans 2:5
.
Who will render to every man according to his deeds: -- romans 2:6
.
To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: -- romans 2:7
.
But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, -- romans 2:8
.
Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; -- romans 2:9
.
But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: -- romans 2:10
.
For there is no respect of persons with God. -- romans 2:11
.
For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; -- romans 2:12
.
(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. -- romans 2:13
.
For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: -- romans 2:14
.
Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) -- romans 2:15
.
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. -- romans 2:16
.
Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, -- romans 2:17
.
And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; -- romans 2:18
.
And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, -- romans 2:19
.
An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. -- romans 2:20
.
Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? -- romans 2:21
.
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? -- romans 2:22
.
Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? -- romans 2:23
.
For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. -- romans 2:24
.
For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. -- romans 2:25
.
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? -- romans 2:26
.
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? -- romans 2:27
.
For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: -- romans 2:28
.
But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. -- romans 2:29
.
What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? -- romans 3:1
.
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. -- romans 3:2
.
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? -- romans 3:3
.
God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. -- romans 3:4
.
But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) -- romans 3:5
.
God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? -- romans 3:6
.
For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? -- romans 3:7
.
And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. -- romans 3:8
.
What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; -- romans 3:9
.
As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: -- romans 3:10
.
There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. -- romans 3:11
.
They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. -- romans 3:12
.
Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: -- romans 3:13
.
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: -- romans 3:14
.
Their feet are swift to shed blood: -- romans 3:15
.
Destruction and misery are in their ways: -- romans 3:16
.
And the way of peace have they not known: -- romans 3:17
.
There is no fear of God before their eyes. -- romans 3:18
.
Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. -- romans 3:19
.
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. -- romans 3:20
.
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; -- romans 3:21
.
Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: -- romans 3:22
.
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; -- romans 3:23
.
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: -- romans 3:24
.
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; -- romans 3:25
.
To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. -- romans 3:26
.
Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. -- romans 3:27
.
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. -- romans 3:28
.
Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: -- romans 3:29
.
Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. -- romans 3:30
.
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. -- romans 3:31
.
What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? -- romans 4:1
.
For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. -- romans 4:2
.
For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. -- romans 4:3
.
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. -- romans 4:4
.
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. -- romans 4:5
.
Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, -- romans 4:6
.
Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. -- romans 4:7
.
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. -- romans 4:8
.
Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. -- romans 4:9
.
How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. -- romans 4:10
.
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: -- romans 4:11
.
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. -- romans 4:12
.
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. -- romans 4:13
.
For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: -- romans 4:14
.
Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. -- romans 4:15
.
Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, -- romans 4:16
.
(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. -- romans 4:17
.
Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. -- romans 4:18
.
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: -- romans 4:19
.
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; -- romans 4:20
.
And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. -- romans 4:21
.
And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. -- romans 4:22
.
Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; -- romans 4:23
.
But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; -- romans 4:24
.
Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. -- romans 4:25
.
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: -- romans 5:1
.
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. -- romans 5:2
.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; -- romans 5:3
.
And patience, experience; and experience, hope: -- romans 5:4
.
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. -- romans 5:5
.
For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. -- romans 5:6
.
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. -- romans 5:7
.
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. -- romans 5:8
.
Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. -- romans 5:9
.
For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. -- romans 5:10
.
And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. -- romans 5:11
.
Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: -- romans 5:12
.
(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. -- romans 5:13
.
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. -- romans 5:14
.
But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. -- romans 5:15
.
And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. -- romans 5:16
.
For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) -- romans 5:17
.
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. -- romans 5:18
.
For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. -- romans 5:19
.
Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: -- romans 5:20
.
That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. -- romans 5:21
.
What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? -- romans 6:1
.
God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? -- romans 6:2
.
Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? -- romans 6:3
.
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. -- romans 6:4
.
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: -- romans 6:5
.
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. -- romans 6:6
.
For he that is dead is freed from sin. -- romans 6:7
.
Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: -- romans 6:8
.
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. -- romans 6:9
.
For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. -- romans 6:10
.
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- romans 6:11
.
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. -- romans 6:12
.
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. -- romans 6:13
.
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. -- romans 6:14
.
What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. -- romans 6:15
.
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? -- romans 6:16
.
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. -- romans 6:17
.
Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. -- romans 6:18
.
I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. -- romans 6:19
.
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. -- romans 6:20
.
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. -- romans 6:21
.
But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. -- romans 6:22
.
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- romans 6:23
.
Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? -- romans 7:1
.
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. -- romans 7:2
.
So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. -- romans 7:3
.
Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. -- romans 7:4
.
For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. -- romans 7:5
.
But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. -- romans 7:6
.
What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. -- romans 7:7
.
But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. -- romans 7:8
.
For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. -- romans 7:9
.
And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. -- romans 7:10
.
For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. -- romans 7:11
.
Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. -- romans 7:12
.
Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. -- romans 7:13
.
For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. -- romans 7:14
.
For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. -- romans 7:15
.
If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. -- romans 7:16
.
Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. -- romans 7:17
.
For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. -- romans 7:18
.
For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. -- romans 7:19
.
Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. -- romans 7:20
.
I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. -- romans 7:21
.
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: -- romans 7:22
.
But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. -- romans 7:23
.
O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? -- romans 7:24
.
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. -- romans 7:25
.
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. -- romans 8:1
.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. -- romans 8:2
.
For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: -- romans 8:3
.
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. -- romans 8:4
.
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. -- romans 8:5
.
For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. -- romans 8:6
.
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. -- romans 8:7
.
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. -- romans 8:8
.
But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. -- romans 8:9
.
And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. -- romans 8:10
.
But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. -- romans 8:11
.
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. -- romans 8:12
.
For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. -- romans 8:13
.
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. -- romans 8:14
.
For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. -- romans 8:15
.
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: -- romans 8:16
.
And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. -- romans 8:17
.
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. -- romans 8:18
.
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. -- romans 8:19
.
For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, -- romans 8:20
.
Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. -- romans 8:21
.
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. -- romans 8:22
.
And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. -- romans 8:23
.
For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? -- romans 8:24
.
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. -- romans 8:25
.
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. -- romans 8:26
.
And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. -- romans 8:27
.
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. -- romans 8:28
.
For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. -- romans 8:29
.
Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. -- romans 8:30
.
What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? -- romans 8:31
.
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? -- romans 8:32
.
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. -- romans 8:33
.
Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. -- romans 8:34
.
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? -- romans 8:35
.
As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. -- romans 8:36
.
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. -- romans 8:37
.
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, -- romans 8:38
.
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- romans 8:39
.
I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, -- romans 9:1
.
That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. -- romans 9:2
.
For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: -- romans 9:3
.
Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; -- romans 9:4
.
Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. -- romans 9:5
.
Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: -- romans 9:6
.
Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. -- romans 9:7
.
That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. -- romans 9:8
.
For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. -- romans 9:9
.
And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; -- romans 9:10
.
(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) -- romans 9:11
.
It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. -- romans 9:12
.
As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. -- romans 9:13
.
What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. -- romans 9:14
.
For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. -- romans 9:15
.
So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. -- romans 9:16
.
For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. -- romans 9:17
.
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. -- romans 9:18
.
Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? -- romans 9:19
.
Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? -- romans 9:20
.
Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? -- romans 9:21
.
What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: -- romans 9:22
.
And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, -- romans 9:23
.
Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? -- romans 9:24
.
As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. -- romans 9:25
.
And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. -- romans 9:26
.
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: -- romans 9:27
.
For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. -- romans 9:28
.
And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. -- romans 9:29
.
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. -- romans 9:30
.
But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. -- romans 9:31
.
Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; -- romans 9:32
.
As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. -- romans 9:33
.
Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. -- romans 10:1
.
For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. -- romans 10:2
.
For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. -- romans 10:3
.
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. -- romans 10:4
.
For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. -- romans 10:5
.
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) -- romans 10:6
.
Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) -- romans 10:7
.
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; -- romans 10:8
.
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. -- romans 10:9
.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. -- romans 10:10
.
For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. -- romans 10:11
.
For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. -- romans 10:12
.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. -- romans 10:13
.
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? -- romans 10:14
.
And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! -- romans 10:15
.
But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? -- romans 10:16
.
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. -- romans 10:17
.
But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. -- romans 10:18
.
But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. -- romans 10:19
.
But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. -- romans 10:20
.
But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. -- romans 10:21
.
I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. -- romans 11:1
.
God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying, -- romans 11:2
.
Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. -- romans 11:3
.
But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. -- romans 11:4
.
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. -- romans 11:5
.
And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. -- romans 11:6
.
What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded. -- romans 11:7
.
(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. -- romans 11:8
.
And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: -- romans 11:9
.
Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. -- romans 11:10
.
I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. -- romans 11:11
.
Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? -- romans 11:12
.
For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: -- romans 11:13
.
If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. -- romans 11:14
.
For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? -- romans 11:15
.
For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. -- romans 11:16
.
And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; -- romans 11:17
.
Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. -- romans 11:18
.
Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. -- romans 11:19
.
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: -- romans 11:20
.
For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. -- romans 11:21
.
Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. -- romans 11:22
.
And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again. -- romans 11:23
.
For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree? -- romans 11:24
.
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. -- romans 11:25
.
And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: -- romans 11:26
.
For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. -- romans 11:27
.
As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes. -- romans 11:28
.
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. -- romans 11:29
.
For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: -- romans 11:30
.
Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. -- romans 11:31
.
For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. -- romans 11:32
.
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! -- romans 11:33
.
For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? -- romans 11:34
.
Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? -- romans 11:35
.
For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. -- romans 11:36
.
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. -- romans 12:1
.
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. -- romans 12:2
.
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. -- romans 12:3
.
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: -- romans 12:4
.
So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. -- romans 12:5
.
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; -- romans 12:6
.
Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; -- romans 12:7
.
Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. -- romans 12:8
.
Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. -- romans 12:9
.
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; -- romans 12:10
.
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; -- romans 12:11
.
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; -- romans 12:12
.
Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. -- romans 12:13
.
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. -- romans 12:14
.
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. -- romans 12:15
.
Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. -- romans 12:16
.
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. -- romans 12:17
.
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. -- romans 12:18
.
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. -- romans 12:19
.
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. -- romans 12:20
.
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. -- romans 12:21
.
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. -- romans 13:1
.
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. -- romans 13:2
.
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: -- romans 13:3
.
For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. -- romans 13:4
.
Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. -- romans 13:5
.
For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. -- romans 13:6
.
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. -- romans 13:7
.
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. -- romans 13:8
.
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. -- romans 13:9
.
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. -- romans 13:10
.
And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. -- romans 13:11
.
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. -- romans 13:12
.
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. -- romans 13:13
.
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. -- romans 13:14
.
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. -- romans 14:1
.
For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. -- romans 14:2
.
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. -- romans 14:3
.
Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. -- romans 14:4
.
One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. -- romans 14:5
.
He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. -- romans 14:6
.
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. -- romans 14:7
.
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. -- romans 14:8
.
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. -- romans 14:9
.
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. -- romans 14:10
.
For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. -- romans 14:11
.
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. -- romans 14:12
.
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. -- romans 14:13
.
I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. -- romans 14:14
.
But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. -- romans 14:15
.
Let not then your good be evil spoken of: -- romans 14:16
.
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. -- romans 14:17
.
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. -- romans 14:18
.
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. -- romans 14:19
.
For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. -- romans 14:20
.
It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. -- romans 14:21
.
Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. -- romans 14:22
.
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. -- romans 14:23
.
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. -- romans 15:1
.
Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. -- romans 15:2
.
For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me. -- romans 15:3
.
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. -- romans 15:4
.
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: -- romans 15:5
.
That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- romans 15:6
.
Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. -- romans 15:7
.
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: -- romans 15:8
.
And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. -- romans 15:9
.
And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. -- romans 15:10
.
And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people. -- romans 15:11
.
And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust. -- romans 15:12
.
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. -- romans 15:13
.
And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. -- romans 15:14
.
Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God, -- romans 15:15
.
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. -- romans 15:16
.
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. -- romans 15:17
.
For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, -- romans 15:18
.
Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. -- romans 15:19
.
Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation: -- romans 15:20
.
But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand. -- romans 15:21
.
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you. -- romans 15:22
.
But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; -- romans 15:23
.
Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company. -- romans 15:24
.
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. -- romans 15:25
.
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem. -- romans 15:26
.
It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. -- romans 15:27
.
When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. -- romans 15:28
.
And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. -- romans 15:29
.
Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; -- romans 15:30
.
That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; -- romans 15:31
.
That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed. -- romans 15:32
.
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. -- romans 15:33
.
I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea: -- romans 16:1
.
That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also. -- romans 16:2
.
Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: -- romans 16:3
.
Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. -- romans 16:4
.
Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ. -- romans 16:5
.
Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. -- romans 16:6
.
Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. -- romans 16:7
.
Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. -- romans 16:8
.
Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. -- romans 16:9
.
Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household. -- romans 16:10
.
Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord. -- romans 16:11
.
Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord. -- romans 16:12
.
Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. -- romans 16:13
.
Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them. -- romans 16:14
.
Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them. -- romans 16:15
.
Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you. -- romans 16:16
.
Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. -- romans 16:17
.
For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. -- romans 16:18
.
For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. -- romans 16:19
.
And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. -- romans 16:20
.
Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you. -- romans 16:21
.
I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord. -- romans 16:22
.
Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. -- romans 16:23
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. -- romans 16:24
.
Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, -- romans 16:25
.
But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: -- romans 16:26
.
To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. -- romans 16:27
.
Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, -- 1 corinthians 1:1
.
Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's: -- 1 corinthians 1:2
.
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 1:3
.
I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; -- 1 corinthians 1:4
.
That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; -- 1 corinthians 1:5
.
Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: -- 1 corinthians 1:6
.
So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: -- 1 corinthians 1:7
.
Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 1:8
.
God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. -- 1 corinthians 1:9
.
Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. -- 1 corinthians 1:10
.
For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. -- 1 corinthians 1:11
.
Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 1:12
.
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? -- 1 corinthians 1:13
.
I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; -- 1 corinthians 1:14
.
Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. -- 1 corinthians 1:15
.
And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. -- 1 corinthians 1:16
.
For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. -- 1 corinthians 1:17
.
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. -- 1 corinthians 1:18
.
For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. -- 1 corinthians 1:19
.
Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? -- 1 corinthians 1:20
.
For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. -- 1 corinthians 1:21
.
For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: -- 1 corinthians 1:22
.
But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; -- 1 corinthians 1:23
.
But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. -- 1 corinthians 1:24
.
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. -- 1 corinthians 1:25
.
For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: -- 1 corinthians 1:26
.
But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; -- 1 corinthians 1:27
.
And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: -- 1 corinthians 1:28
.
That no flesh should glory in his presence. -- 1 corinthians 1:29
.
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: -- 1 corinthians 1:30
.
That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 1:31
.
And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:1
.
For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. -- 1 corinthians 2:2
.
And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. -- 1 corinthians 2:3
.
And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: -- 1 corinthians 2:4
.
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:5
.
Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: -- 1 corinthians 2:6
.
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: -- 1 corinthians 2:7
.
Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. -- 1 corinthians 2:8
.
But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. -- 1 corinthians 2:9
.
But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:10
.
For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:11
.
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:12
.
Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. -- 1 corinthians 2:13
.
But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. -- 1 corinthians 2:14
.
But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. -- 1 corinthians 2:15
.
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 2:16
.
And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. -- 1 corinthians 3:1
.
I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. -- 1 corinthians 3:2
.
For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? -- 1 corinthians 3:3
.
For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? -- 1 corinthians 3:4
.
Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? -- 1 corinthians 3:5
.
I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. -- 1 corinthians 3:6
.
So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. -- 1 corinthians 3:7
.
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. -- 1 corinthians 3:8
.
For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. -- 1 corinthians 3:9
.
According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. -- 1 corinthians 3:10
.
For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 3:11
.
Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; -- 1 corinthians 3:12
.
Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. -- 1 corinthians 3:13
.
If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. -- 1 corinthians 3:14
.
If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. -- 1 corinthians 3:15
.
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? -- 1 corinthians 3:16
.
If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. -- 1 corinthians 3:17
.
Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. -- 1 corinthians 3:18
.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. -- 1 corinthians 3:19
.
And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. -- 1 corinthians 3:20
.
Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's; -- 1 corinthians 3:21
.
Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's; -- 1 corinthians 3:22
.
And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- 1 corinthians 3:23
.
Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. -- 1 corinthians 4:1
.
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. -- 1 corinthians 4:2
.
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. -- 1 corinthians 4:3
.
For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 4:4
.
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. -- 1 corinthians 4:5
.
And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. -- 1 corinthians 4:6
.
For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? -- 1 corinthians 4:7
.
Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. -- 1 corinthians 4:8
.
For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. -- 1 corinthians 4:9
.
We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. -- 1 corinthians 4:10
.
Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; -- 1 corinthians 4:11
.
And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: -- 1 corinthians 4:12
.
Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day. -- 1 corinthians 4:13
.
I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you. -- 1 corinthians 4:14
.
For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. -- 1 corinthians 4:15
.
Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. -- 1 corinthians 4:16
.
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. -- 1 corinthians 4:17
.
Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. -- 1 corinthians 4:18
.
But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. -- 1 corinthians 4:19
.
For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. -- 1 corinthians 4:20
.
What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness? -- 1 corinthians 4:21
.
It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. -- 1 corinthians 5:1
.
And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. -- 1 corinthians 5:2
.
For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, -- 1 corinthians 5:3
.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, -- 1 corinthians 5:4
.
To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. -- 1 corinthians 5:5
.
Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? -- 1 corinthians 5:6
.
Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: -- 1 corinthians 5:7
.
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. -- 1 corinthians 5:8
.
I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: -- 1 corinthians 5:9
.
Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. -- 1 corinthians 5:10
.
But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. -- 1 corinthians 5:11
.
For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? -- 1 corinthians 5:12
.
But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. -- 1 corinthians 5:13
.
Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? -- 1 corinthians 6:1
.
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? -- 1 corinthians 6:2
.
Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? -- 1 corinthians 6:3
.
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. -- 1 corinthians 6:4
.
I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? -- 1 corinthians 6:5
.
But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. -- 1 corinthians 6:6
.
Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? -- 1 corinthians 6:7
.
Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. -- 1 corinthians 6:8
.
Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, -- 1 corinthians 6:9
.
Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. -- 1 corinthians 6:10
.
And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. -- 1 corinthians 6:11
.
All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. -- 1 corinthians 6:12
.
Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. -- 1 corinthians 6:13
.
And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. -- 1 corinthians 6:14
.
Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. -- 1 corinthians 6:15
.
What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. -- 1 corinthians 6:16
.
But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. -- 1 corinthians 6:17
.
Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. -- 1 corinthians 6:18
.
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? -- 1 corinthians 6:19
.
For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. -- 1 corinthians 6:20
.
Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. -- 1 corinthians 7:1
.
Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:2
.
Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:3
.
The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. -- 1 corinthians 7:4
.
Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. -- 1 corinthians 7:5
.
But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. -- 1 corinthians 7:6
.
For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. -- 1 corinthians 7:7
.
I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. -- 1 corinthians 7:8
.
But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. -- 1 corinthians 7:9
.
And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: -- 1 corinthians 7:10
.
But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. -- 1 corinthians 7:11
.
But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. -- 1 corinthians 7:12
.
And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. -- 1 corinthians 7:13
.
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. -- 1 corinthians 7:14
.
But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. -- 1 corinthians 7:15
.
For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife? -- 1 corinthians 7:16
.
But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. -- 1 corinthians 7:17
.
Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. -- 1 corinthians 7:18
.
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. -- 1 corinthians 7:19
.
Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. -- 1 corinthians 7:20
.
Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. -- 1 corinthians 7:21
.
For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant. -- 1 corinthians 7:22
.
Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. -- 1 corinthians 7:23
.
Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. -- 1 corinthians 7:24
.
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. -- 1 corinthians 7:25
.
I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be. -- 1 corinthians 7:26
.
Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. -- 1 corinthians 7:27
.
But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you. -- 1 corinthians 7:28
.
But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; -- 1 corinthians 7:29
.
And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; -- 1 corinthians 7:30
.
And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away. -- 1 corinthians 7:31
.
But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: -- 1 corinthians 7:32
.
But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. -- 1 corinthians 7:33
.
There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:34
.
And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. -- 1 corinthians 7:35
.
But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. -- 1 corinthians 7:36
.
Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. -- 1 corinthians 7:37
.
So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better. -- 1 corinthians 7:38
.
The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 7:39
.
But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God. -- 1 corinthians 7:40
.
Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. -- 1 corinthians 8:1
.
And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. -- 1 corinthians 8:2
.
But if any man love God, the same is known of him. -- 1 corinthians 8:3
.
As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one. -- 1 corinthians 8:4
.
For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) -- 1 corinthians 8:5
.
But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. -- 1 corinthians 8:6
.
Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. -- 1 corinthians 8:7
.
But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. -- 1 corinthians 8:8
.
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. -- 1 corinthians 8:9
.
For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; -- 1 corinthians 8:10
.
And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? -- 1 corinthians 8:11
.
But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. -- 1 corinthians 8:12
.
Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend. -- 1 corinthians 8:13
.
Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? -- 1 corinthians 9:1
.
If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 9:2
.
Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, -- 1 corinthians 9:3
.
Have we not power to eat and to drink? -- 1 corinthians 9:4
.
Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? -- 1 corinthians 9:5
.
Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? -- 1 corinthians 9:6
.
Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? -- 1 corinthians 9:7
.
Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? -- 1 corinthians 9:8
.
For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? -- 1 corinthians 9:9
.
Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. -- 1 corinthians 9:10
.
If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? -- 1 corinthians 9:11
.
If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 9:12
.
Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? -- 1 corinthians 9:13
.
Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. -- 1 corinthians 9:14
.
But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. -- 1 corinthians 9:15
.
For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! -- 1 corinthians 9:16
.
For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. -- 1 corinthians 9:17
.
What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. -- 1 corinthians 9:18
.
For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. -- 1 corinthians 9:19
.
And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; -- 1 corinthians 9:20
.
To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. -- 1 corinthians 9:21
.
To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. -- 1 corinthians 9:22
.
And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. -- 1 corinthians 9:23
.
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. -- 1 corinthians 9:24
.
And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. -- 1 corinthians 9:25
.
I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: -- 1 corinthians 9:26
.
But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. -- 1 corinthians 9:27
.
Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; -- 1 corinthians 10:1
.
And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; -- 1 corinthians 10:2
.
And did all eat the same spiritual meat; -- 1 corinthians 10:3
.
And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. -- 1 corinthians 10:4
.
But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. -- 1 corinthians 10:5
.
Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. -- 1 corinthians 10:6
.
Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. -- 1 corinthians 10:7
.
Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. -- 1 corinthians 10:8
.
Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. -- 1 corinthians 10:9
.
Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. -- 1 corinthians 10:10
.
Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. -- 1 corinthians 10:11
.
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. -- 1 corinthians 10:12
.
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. -- 1 corinthians 10:13
.
Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. -- 1 corinthians 10:14
.
I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. -- 1 corinthians 10:15
.
The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? -- 1 corinthians 10:16
.
For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. -- 1 corinthians 10:17
.
Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? -- 1 corinthians 10:18
.
What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? -- 1 corinthians 10:19
.
But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. -- 1 corinthians 10:20
.
Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. -- 1 corinthians 10:21
.
Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? -- 1 corinthians 10:22
.
All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. -- 1 corinthians 10:23
.
Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth. -- 1 corinthians 10:24
.
Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake: -- 1 corinthians 10:25
.
For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. -- 1 corinthians 10:26
.
If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. -- 1 corinthians 10:27
.
But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof: -- 1 corinthians 10:28
.
Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience? -- 1 corinthians 10:29
.
For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? -- 1 corinthians 10:30
.
Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. -- 1 corinthians 10:31
.
Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: -- 1 corinthians 10:32
.
Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. -- 1 corinthians 10:33
.
Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 11:1
.
Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. -- 1 corinthians 11:2
.
But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. -- 1 corinthians 11:3
.
Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. -- 1 corinthians 11:4
.
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. -- 1 corinthians 11:5
.
For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. -- 1 corinthians 11:6
.
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. -- 1 corinthians 11:7
.
For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man. -- 1 corinthians 11:8
.
Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. -- 1 corinthians 11:9
.
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. -- 1 corinthians 11:10
.
Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 11:11
.
For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. -- 1 corinthians 11:12
.
Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? -- 1 corinthians 11:13
.
Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? -- 1 corinthians 11:14
.
But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. -- 1 corinthians 11:15
.
But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. -- 1 corinthians 11:16
.
Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. -- 1 corinthians 11:17
.
For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. -- 1 corinthians 11:18
.
For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. -- 1 corinthians 11:19
.
When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. -- 1 corinthians 11:20
.
For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. -- 1 corinthians 11:21
.
What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. -- 1 corinthians 11:22
.
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: -- 1 corinthians 11:23
.
And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. -- 1 corinthians 11:24
.
After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. -- 1 corinthians 11:25
.
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. -- 1 corinthians 11:26
.
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 11:27
.
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. -- 1 corinthians 11:28
.
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. -- 1 corinthians 11:29
.
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. -- 1 corinthians 11:30
.
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. -- 1 corinthians 11:31
.
But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. -- 1 corinthians 11:32
.
Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. -- 1 corinthians 11:33
.
And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. -- 1 corinthians 11:34
.
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. -- 1 corinthians 12:1
.
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. -- 1 corinthians 12:2
.
Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. -- 1 corinthians 12:3
.
Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. -- 1 corinthians 12:4
.
And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. -- 1 corinthians 12:5
.
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. -- 1 corinthians 12:6
.
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. -- 1 corinthians 12:7
.
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; -- 1 corinthians 12:8
.
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; -- 1 corinthians 12:9
.
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: -- 1 corinthians 12:10
.
But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. -- 1 corinthians 12:11
.
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. -- 1 corinthians 12:12
.
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. -- 1 corinthians 12:13
.
For the body is not one member, but many. -- 1 corinthians 12:14
.
If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? -- 1 corinthians 12:15
.
And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? -- 1 corinthians 12:16
.
If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? -- 1 corinthians 12:17
.
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. -- 1 corinthians 12:18
.
And if they were all one member, where were the body? -- 1 corinthians 12:19
.
But now are they many members, yet but one body. -- 1 corinthians 12:20
.
And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. -- 1 corinthians 12:21
.
Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: -- 1 corinthians 12:22
.
And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. -- 1 corinthians 12:23
.
For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked. -- 1 corinthians 12:24
.
That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. -- 1 corinthians 12:25
.
And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. -- 1 corinthians 12:26
.
Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. -- 1 corinthians 12:27
.
And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. -- 1 corinthians 12:28
.
Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? -- 1 corinthians 12:29
.
Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? -- 1 corinthians 12:30
.
But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. -- 1 corinthians 12:31
.
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. -- 1 corinthians 13:1
.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. -- 1 corinthians 13:2
.
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. -- 1 corinthians 13:3
.
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, -- 1 corinthians 13:4
.
Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; -- 1 corinthians 13:5
.
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; -- 1 corinthians 13:6
.
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. -- 1 corinthians 13:7
.
Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. -- 1 corinthians 13:8
.
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. -- 1 corinthians 13:9
.
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. -- 1 corinthians 13:10
.
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. -- 1 corinthians 13:11
.
For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. -- 1 corinthians 13:12
.
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. -- 1 corinthians 13:13
.
Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. -- 1 corinthians 14:1
.
For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. -- 1 corinthians 14:2
.
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. -- 1 corinthians 14:3
.
He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. -- 1 corinthians 14:4
.
I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. -- 1 corinthians 14:5
.
Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? -- 1 corinthians 14:6
.
And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? -- 1 corinthians 14:7
.
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? -- 1 corinthians 14:8
.
So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. -- 1 corinthians 14:9
.
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. -- 1 corinthians 14:10
.
Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. -- 1 corinthians 14:11
.
Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. -- 1 corinthians 14:12
.
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret. -- 1 corinthians 14:13
.
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. -- 1 corinthians 14:14
.
What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. -- 1 corinthians 14:15
.
Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? -- 1 corinthians 14:16
.
For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. -- 1 corinthians 14:17
.
I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: -- 1 corinthians 14:18
.
Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. -- 1 corinthians 14:19
.
Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. -- 1 corinthians 14:20
.
In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 14:21
.
Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe. -- 1 corinthians 14:22
.
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? -- 1 corinthians 14:23
.
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: -- 1 corinthians 14:24
.
And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. -- 1 corinthians 14:25
.
How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. -- 1 corinthians 14:26
.
If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. -- 1 corinthians 14:27
.
But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. -- 1 corinthians 14:28
.
Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. -- 1 corinthians 14:29
.
If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. -- 1 corinthians 14:30
.
For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. -- 1 corinthians 14:31
.
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. -- 1 corinthians 14:32
.
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. -- 1 corinthians 14:33
.
Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. -- 1 corinthians 14:34
.
And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. -- 1 corinthians 14:35
.
What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? -- 1 corinthians 14:36
.
If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 14:37
.
But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. -- 1 corinthians 14:38
.
Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. -- 1 corinthians 14:39
.
Let all things be done decently and in order. -- 1 corinthians 14:40
.
Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; -- 1 corinthians 15:1
.
By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. -- 1 corinthians 15:2
.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; -- 1 corinthians 15:3
.
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: -- 1 corinthians 15:4
.
And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: -- 1 corinthians 15:5
.
After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. -- 1 corinthians 15:6
.
After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. -- 1 corinthians 15:7
.
And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. -- 1 corinthians 15:8
.
For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. -- 1 corinthians 15:9
.
But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. -- 1 corinthians 15:10
.
Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. -- 1 corinthians 15:11
.
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? -- 1 corinthians 15:12
.
But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: -- 1 corinthians 15:13
.
And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. -- 1 corinthians 15:14
.
Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. -- 1 corinthians 15:15
.
For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: -- 1 corinthians 15:16
.
And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. -- 1 corinthians 15:17
.
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. -- 1 corinthians 15:18
.
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. -- 1 corinthians 15:19
.
But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. -- 1 corinthians 15:20
.
For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. -- 1 corinthians 15:21
.
For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. -- 1 corinthians 15:22
.
But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. -- 1 corinthians 15:23
.
Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. -- 1 corinthians 15:24
.
For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. -- 1 corinthians 15:25
.
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. -- 1 corinthians 15:26
.
For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. -- 1 corinthians 15:27
.
And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. -- 1 corinthians 15:28
.
Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? -- 1 corinthians 15:29
.
And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? -- 1 corinthians 15:30
.
I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. -- 1 corinthians 15:31
.
If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die. -- 1 corinthians 15:32
.
Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. -- 1 corinthians 15:33
.
Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. -- 1 corinthians 15:34
.
But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? -- 1 corinthians 15:35
.
Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: -- 1 corinthians 15:36
.
And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: -- 1 corinthians 15:37
.
But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. -- 1 corinthians 15:38
.
All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. -- 1 corinthians 15:39
.
There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. -- 1 corinthians 15:40
.
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. -- 1 corinthians 15:41
.
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: -- 1 corinthians 15:42
.
It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: -- 1 corinthians 15:43
.
It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. -- 1 corinthians 15:44
.
And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. -- 1 corinthians 15:45
.
Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. -- 1 corinthians 15:46
.
The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. -- 1 corinthians 15:47
.
As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. -- 1 corinthians 15:48
.
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. -- 1 corinthians 15:49
.
Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. -- 1 corinthians 15:50
.
Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, -- 1 corinthians 15:51
.
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. -- 1 corinthians 15:52
.
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. -- 1 corinthians 15:53
.
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. -- 1 corinthians 15:54
.
O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? -- 1 corinthians 15:55
.
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. -- 1 corinthians 15:56
.
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 15:57
.
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 15:58
.
Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. -- 1 corinthians 16:1
.
Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. -- 1 corinthians 16:2
.
And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. -- 1 corinthians 16:3
.
And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. -- 1 corinthians 16:4
.
Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. -- 1 corinthians 16:5
.
And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. -- 1 corinthians 16:6
.
For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. -- 1 corinthians 16:7
.
But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. -- 1 corinthians 16:8
.
For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. -- 1 corinthians 16:9
.
Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. -- 1 corinthians 16:10
.
Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. -- 1 corinthians 16:11
.
As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time. -- 1 corinthians 16:12
.
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. -- 1 corinthians 16:13
.
Let all your things be done with charity. -- 1 corinthians 16:14
.
I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) -- 1 corinthians 16:15
.
That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth. -- 1 corinthians 16:16
.
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. -- 1 corinthians 16:17
.
For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. -- 1 corinthians 16:18
.
The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. -- 1 corinthians 16:19
.
All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. -- 1 corinthians 16:20
.
The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. -- 1 corinthians 16:21
.
If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. -- 1 corinthians 16:22
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. -- 1 corinthians 16:23
.
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. -- 1 corinthians 16:24
.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia: -- 2 corinthians 1:1
.
Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 corinthians 1:2
.
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; -- 2 corinthians 1:3
.
Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. -- 2 corinthians 1:4
.
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. -- 2 corinthians 1:5
.
And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. -- 2 corinthians 1:6
.
And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation. -- 2 corinthians 1:7
.
For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: -- 2 corinthians 1:8
.
But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: -- 2 corinthians 1:9
.
Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; -- 2 corinthians 1:10
.
Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf. -- 2 corinthians 1:11
.
For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. -- 2 corinthians 1:12
.
For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; -- 2 corinthians 1:13
.
As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus. -- 2 corinthians 1:14
.
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; -- 2 corinthians 1:15
.
And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea. -- 2 corinthians 1:16
.
When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? -- 2 corinthians 1:17
.
But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. -- 2 corinthians 1:18
.
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. -- 2 corinthians 1:19
.
For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. -- 2 corinthians 1:20
.
Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; -- 2 corinthians 1:21
.
Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. -- 2 corinthians 1:22
.
Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. -- 2 corinthians 1:23
.
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. -- 2 corinthians 1:24
.
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. -- 2 corinthians 2:1
.
For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? -- 2 corinthians 2:2
.
And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. -- 2 corinthians 2:3
.
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. -- 2 corinthians 2:4
.
But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. -- 2 corinthians 2:5
.
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. -- 2 corinthians 2:6
.
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. -- 2 corinthians 2:7
.
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. -- 2 corinthians 2:8
.
For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. -- 2 corinthians 2:9
.
To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; -- 2 corinthians 2:10
.
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. -- 2 corinthians 2:11
.
Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, -- 2 corinthians 2:12
.
I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. -- 2 corinthians 2:13
.
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. -- 2 corinthians 2:14
.
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: -- 2 corinthians 2:15
.
To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? -- 2 corinthians 2:16
.
For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. -- 2 corinthians 2:17
.
Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? -- 2 corinthians 3:1
.
Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: -- 2 corinthians 3:2
.
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. -- 2 corinthians 3:3
.
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: -- 2 corinthians 3:4
.
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; -- 2 corinthians 3:5
.
Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. -- 2 corinthians 3:6
.
But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: -- 2 corinthians 3:7
.
How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? -- 2 corinthians 3:8
.
For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. -- 2 corinthians 3:9
.
For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. -- 2 corinthians 3:10
.
For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious. -- 2 corinthians 3:11
.
Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: -- 2 corinthians 3:12
.
And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: -- 2 corinthians 3:13
.
But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ. -- 2 corinthians 3:14
.
But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. -- 2 corinthians 3:15
.
Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. -- 2 corinthians 3:16
.
Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. -- 2 corinthians 3:17
.
But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 3:18
.
Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; -- 2 corinthians 4:1
.
But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. -- 2 corinthians 4:2
.
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: -- 2 corinthians 4:3
.
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. -- 2 corinthians 4:4
.
For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. -- 2 corinthians 4:5
.
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. -- 2 corinthians 4:6
.
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. -- 2 corinthians 4:7
.
We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; -- 2 corinthians 4:8
.
Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; -- 2 corinthians 4:9
.
Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. -- 2 corinthians 4:10
.
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. -- 2 corinthians 4:11
.
So then death worketh in us, but life in you. -- 2 corinthians 4:12
.
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; -- 2 corinthians 4:13
.
Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. -- 2 corinthians 4:14
.
For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. -- 2 corinthians 4:15
.
For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. -- 2 corinthians 4:16
.
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; -- 2 corinthians 4:17
.
While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. -- 2 corinthians 4:18
.
For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. -- 2 corinthians 5:1
.
For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: -- 2 corinthians 5:2
.
If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. -- 2 corinthians 5:3
.
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. -- 2 corinthians 5:4
.
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. -- 2 corinthians 5:5
.
Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: -- 2 corinthians 5:6
.
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) -- 2 corinthians 5:7
.
We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 5:8
.
Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. -- 2 corinthians 5:9
.
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. -- 2 corinthians 5:10
.
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. -- 2 corinthians 5:11
.
For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. -- 2 corinthians 5:12
.
For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. -- 2 corinthians 5:13
.
For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: -- 2 corinthians 5:14
.
And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. -- 2 corinthians 5:15
.
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. -- 2 corinthians 5:16
.
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. -- 2 corinthians 5:17
.
And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; -- 2 corinthians 5:18
.
To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. -- 2 corinthians 5:19
.
Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. -- 2 corinthians 5:20
.
For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. -- 2 corinthians 5:21
.
We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. -- 2 corinthians 6:1
.
(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) -- 2 corinthians 6:2
.
Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: -- 2 corinthians 6:3
.
But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, -- 2 corinthians 6:4
.
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; -- 2 corinthians 6:5
.
By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, -- 2 corinthians 6:6
.
By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, -- 2 corinthians 6:7
.
By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; -- 2 corinthians 6:8
.
As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; -- 2 corinthians 6:9
.
As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. -- 2 corinthians 6:10
.
O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. -- 2 corinthians 6:11
.
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. -- 2 corinthians 6:12
.
Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged. -- 2 corinthians 6:13
.
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? -- 2 corinthians 6:14
.
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? -- 2 corinthians 6:15
.
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. -- 2 corinthians 6:16
.
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you. -- 2 corinthians 6:17
.
And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. -- 2 corinthians 6:18
.
Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. -- 2 corinthians 7:1
.
Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. -- 2 corinthians 7:2
.
I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you. -- 2 corinthians 7:3
.
Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. -- 2 corinthians 7:4
.
For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. -- 2 corinthians 7:5
.
Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; -- 2 corinthians 7:6
.
And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. -- 2 corinthians 7:7
.
For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season. -- 2 corinthians 7:8
.
Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. -- 2 corinthians 7:9
.
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. -- 2 corinthians 7:10
.
For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. -- 2 corinthians 7:11
.
Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you. -- 2 corinthians 7:12
.
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. -- 2 corinthians 7:13
.
For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth. -- 2 corinthians 7:14
.
And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. -- 2 corinthians 7:15
.
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things. -- 2 corinthians 7:16
.
Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; -- 2 corinthians 8:1
.
How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. -- 2 corinthians 8:2
.
For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; -- 2 corinthians 8:3
.
Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. -- 2 corinthians 8:4
.
And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. -- 2 corinthians 8:5
.
Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. -- 2 corinthians 8:6
.
Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. -- 2 corinthians 8:7
.
I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. -- 2 corinthians 8:8
.
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. -- 2 corinthians 8:9
.
And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. -- 2 corinthians 8:10
.
Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. -- 2 corinthians 8:11
.
For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. -- 2 corinthians 8:12
.
For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: -- 2 corinthians 8:13
.
But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality: -- 2 corinthians 8:14
.
As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack. -- 2 corinthians 8:15
.
But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. -- 2 corinthians 8:16
.
For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. -- 2 corinthians 8:17
.
And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; -- 2 corinthians 8:18
.
And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: -- 2 corinthians 8:19
.
Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: -- 2 corinthians 8:20
.
Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. -- 2 corinthians 8:21
.
And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. -- 2 corinthians 8:22
.
Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ. -- 2 corinthians 8:23
.
Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. -- 2 corinthians 8:24
.
For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: -- 2 corinthians 9:1
.
For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. -- 2 corinthians 9:2
.
Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: -- 2 corinthians 9:3
.
Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. -- 2 corinthians 9:4
.
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness. -- 2 corinthians 9:5
.
But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. -- 2 corinthians 9:6
.
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. -- 2 corinthians 9:7
.
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: -- 2 corinthians 9:8
.
(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. -- 2 corinthians 9:9
.
Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) -- 2 corinthians 9:10
.
Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. -- 2 corinthians 9:11
.
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; -- 2 corinthians 9:12
.
Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; -- 2 corinthians 9:13
.
And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you. -- 2 corinthians 9:14
.
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. -- 2 corinthians 9:15
.
Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: -- 2 corinthians 10:1
.
But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. -- 2 corinthians 10:2
.
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: -- 2 corinthians 10:3
.
(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) -- 2 corinthians 10:4
.
Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; -- 2 corinthians 10:5
.
And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. -- 2 corinthians 10:6
.
Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's. -- 2 corinthians 10:7
.
For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: -- 2 corinthians 10:8
.
That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. -- 2 corinthians 10:9
.
For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. -- 2 corinthians 10:10
.
Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present. -- 2 corinthians 10:11
.
For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. -- 2 corinthians 10:12
.
But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. -- 2 corinthians 10:13
.
For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ: -- 2 corinthians 10:14
.
Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, -- 2 corinthians 10:15
.
To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. -- 2 corinthians 10:16
.
But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 10:17
.
For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. -- 2 corinthians 10:18
.
Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. -- 2 corinthians 11:1
.
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. -- 2 corinthians 11:2
.
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. -- 2 corinthians 11:3
.
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. -- 2 corinthians 11:4
.
For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. -- 2 corinthians 11:5
.
But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. -- 2 corinthians 11:6
.
Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? -- 2 corinthians 11:7
.
I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. -- 2 corinthians 11:8
.
And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. -- 2 corinthians 11:9
.
As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. -- 2 corinthians 11:10
.
Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. -- 2 corinthians 11:11
.
But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. -- 2 corinthians 11:12
.
For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. -- 2 corinthians 11:13
.
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. -- 2 corinthians 11:14
.
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. -- 2 corinthians 11:15
.
I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. -- 2 corinthians 11:16
.
That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. -- 2 corinthians 11:17
.
Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. -- 2 corinthians 11:18
.
For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. -- 2 corinthians 11:19
.
For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. -- 2 corinthians 11:20
.
I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. -- 2 corinthians 11:21
.
Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. -- 2 corinthians 11:22
.
Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. -- 2 corinthians 11:23
.
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. -- 2 corinthians 11:24
.
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; -- 2 corinthians 11:25
.
In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; -- 2 corinthians 11:26
.
In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. -- 2 corinthians 11:27
.
Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. -- 2 corinthians 11:28
.
Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? -- 2 corinthians 11:29
.
If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. -- 2 corinthians 11:30
.
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. -- 2 corinthians 11:31
.
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: -- 2 corinthians 11:32
.
And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands. -- 2 corinthians 11:33
.
It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 12:1
.
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. -- 2 corinthians 12:2
.
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) -- 2 corinthians 12:3
.
How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. -- 2 corinthians 12:4
.
Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities. -- 2 corinthians 12:5
.
For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. -- 2 corinthians 12:6
.
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. -- 2 corinthians 12:7
.
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. -- 2 corinthians 12:8
.
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. -- 2 corinthians 12:9
.
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. -- 2 corinthians 12:10
.
I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. -- 2 corinthians 12:11
.
Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. -- 2 corinthians 12:12
.
For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. -- 2 corinthians 12:13
.
Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. -- 2 corinthians 12:14
.
And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. -- 2 corinthians 12:15
.
But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. -- 2 corinthians 12:16
.
Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? -- 2 corinthians 12:17
.
I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps? -- 2 corinthians 12:18
.
Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying. -- 2 corinthians 12:19
.
For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: -- 2 corinthians 12:20
.
And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed. -- 2 corinthians 12:21
.
This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. -- 2 corinthians 13:1
.
I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: -- 2 corinthians 13:2
.
Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you. -- 2 corinthians 13:3
.
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you. -- 2 corinthians 13:4
.
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? -- 2 corinthians 13:5
.
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. -- 2 corinthians 13:6
.
Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. -- 2 corinthians 13:7
.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. -- 2 corinthians 13:8
.
For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. -- 2 corinthians 13:9
.
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction. -- 2 corinthians 13:10
.
Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. -- 2 corinthians 13:11
.
Greet one another with an holy kiss. -- 2 corinthians 13:12
.
All the saints salute you. -- 2 corinthians 13:13
.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen. -- 2 corinthians 13:14
.
Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) -- galatians 1:1
.
And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: -- galatians 1:2
.
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, -- galatians 1:3
.
Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: -- galatians 1:4
.
To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. -- galatians 1:5
.
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: -- galatians 1:6
.
Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. -- galatians 1:7
.
But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. -- galatians 1:8
.
As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. -- galatians 1:9
.
For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. -- galatians 1:10
.
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. -- galatians 1:11
.
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. -- galatians 1:12
.
For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: -- galatians 1:13
.
And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. -- galatians 1:14
.
But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, -- galatians 1:15
.
To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: -- galatians 1:16
.
Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. -- galatians 1:17
.
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. -- galatians 1:18
.
But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. -- galatians 1:19
.
Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. -- galatians 1:20
.
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; -- galatians 1:21
.
And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: -- galatians 1:22
.
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. -- galatians 1:23
.
And they glorified God in me. -- galatians 1:24
.
Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. -- galatians 2:1
.
And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. -- galatians 2:2
.
But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: -- galatians 2:3
.
And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: -- galatians 2:4
.
To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. -- galatians 2:5
.
But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: -- galatians 2:6
.
But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; -- galatians 2:7
.
(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) -- galatians 2:8
.
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. -- galatians 2:9
.
Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do. -- galatians 2:10
.
But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. -- galatians 2:11
.
For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. -- galatians 2:12
.
And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. -- galatians 2:13
.
But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? -- galatians 2:14
.
We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, -- galatians 2:15
.
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. -- galatians 2:16
.
But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. -- galatians 2:17
.
For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. -- galatians 2:18
.
For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. -- galatians 2:19
.
I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. -- galatians 2:20
.
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. -- galatians 2:21
.
O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? -- galatians 3:1
.
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? -- galatians 3:2
.
Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? -- galatians 3:3
.
Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. -- galatians 3:4
.
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? -- galatians 3:5
.
Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. -- galatians 3:6
.
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. -- galatians 3:7
.
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. -- galatians 3:8
.
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. -- galatians 3:9
.
For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. -- galatians 3:10
.
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. -- galatians 3:11
.
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. -- galatians 3:12
.
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: -- galatians 3:13
.
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. -- galatians 3:14
.
Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. -- galatians 3:15
.
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. -- galatians 3:16
.
And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. -- galatians 3:17
.
For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. -- galatians 3:18
.
Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. -- galatians 3:19
.
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. -- galatians 3:20
.
Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. -- galatians 3:21
.
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. -- galatians 3:22
.
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. -- galatians 3:23
.
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. -- galatians 3:24
.
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. -- galatians 3:25
.
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. -- galatians 3:26
.
For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. -- galatians 3:27
.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. -- galatians 3:28
.
And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. -- galatians 3:29
.
Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; -- galatians 4:1
.
But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. -- galatians 4:2
.
Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: -- galatians 4:3
.
But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, -- galatians 4:4
.
To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. -- galatians 4:5
.
And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. -- galatians 4:6
.
Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. -- galatians 4:7
.
Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. -- galatians 4:8
.
But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? -- galatians 4:9
.
Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. -- galatians 4:10
.
I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. -- galatians 4:11
.
Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all. -- galatians 4:12
.
Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. -- galatians 4:13
.
And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. -- galatians 4:14
.
Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. -- galatians 4:15
.
Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? -- galatians 4:16
.
They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. -- galatians 4:17
.
But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. -- galatians 4:18
.
My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, -- galatians 4:19
.
I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. -- galatians 4:20
.
Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? -- galatians 4:21
.
For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. -- galatians 4:22
.
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. -- galatians 4:23
.
Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. -- galatians 4:24
.
For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. -- galatians 4:25
.
But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. -- galatians 4:26
.
For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. -- galatians 4:27
.
Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. -- galatians 4:28
.
But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. -- galatians 4:29
.
Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. -- galatians 4:30
.
So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. -- galatians 4:31
.
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. -- galatians 5:1
.
Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. -- galatians 5:2
.
For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. -- galatians 5:3
.
Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. -- galatians 5:4
.
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. -- galatians 5:5
.
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. -- galatians 5:6
.
Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? -- galatians 5:7
.
This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. -- galatians 5:8
.
A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. -- galatians 5:9
.
I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. -- galatians 5:10
.
And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. -- galatians 5:11
.
I would they were even cut off which trouble you. -- galatians 5:12
.
For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. -- galatians 5:13
.
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. -- galatians 5:14
.
But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. -- galatians 5:15
.
This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. -- galatians 5:16
.
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. -- galatians 5:17
.
But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. -- galatians 5:18
.
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, -- galatians 5:19
.
Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, -- galatians 5:20
.
Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. -- galatians 5:21
.
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, -- galatians 5:22
.
Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. -- galatians 5:23
.
And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. -- galatians 5:24
.
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. -- galatians 5:25
.
Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. -- galatians 5:26
.
Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. -- galatians 6:1
.
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. -- galatians 6:2
.
For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. -- galatians 6:3
.
But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. -- galatians 6:4
.
For every man shall bear his own burden. -- galatians 6:5
.
Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. -- galatians 6:6
.
Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. -- galatians 6:7
.
For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. -- galatians 6:8
.
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- galatians 6:9
.
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. -- galatians 6:10
.
Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. -- galatians 6:11
.
As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. -- galatians 6:12
.
For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. -- galatians 6:13
.
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. -- galatians 6:14
.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. -- galatians 6:15
.
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. -- galatians 6:16
.
From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. -- galatians 6:17
.
Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. -- galatians 6:18
.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: -- ephesians 1:1
.
Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. -- ephesians 1:2
.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: -- ephesians 1:3
.
According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: -- ephesians 1:4
.
Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, -- ephesians 1:5
.
To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. -- ephesians 1:6
.
In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; -- ephesians 1:7
.
Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; -- ephesians 1:8
.
Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: -- ephesians 1:9
.
That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: -- ephesians 1:10
.
In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: -- ephesians 1:11
.
That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. -- ephesians 1:12
.
In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, -- ephesians 1:13
.
Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. -- ephesians 1:14
.
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, -- ephesians 1:15
.
Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; -- ephesians 1:16
.
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: -- ephesians 1:17
.
The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, -- ephesians 1:18
.
And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, -- ephesians 1:19
.
Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, -- ephesians 1:20
.
Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: -- ephesians 1:21
.
And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, -- ephesians 1:22
.
Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. -- ephesians 1:23
.
And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; -- ephesians 2:1
.
Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: -- ephesians 2:2
.
Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. -- ephesians 2:3
.
But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, -- ephesians 2:4
.
Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) -- ephesians 2:5
.
And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: -- ephesians 2:6
.
That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. -- ephesians 2:7
.
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: -- ephesians 2:8
.
Not of works, lest any man should boast. -- ephesians 2:9
.
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. -- ephesians 2:10
.
Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; -- ephesians 2:11
.
That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: -- ephesians 2:12
.
But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. -- ephesians 2:13
.
For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; -- ephesians 2:14
.
Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; -- ephesians 2:15
.
And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: -- ephesians 2:16
.
And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. -- ephesians 2:17
.
For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. -- ephesians 2:18
.
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; -- ephesians 2:19
.
And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; -- ephesians 2:20
.
In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: -- ephesians 2:21
.
In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. -- ephesians 2:22
.
For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, -- ephesians 3:1
.
If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: -- ephesians 3:2
.
How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, -- ephesians 3:3
.
Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) -- ephesians 3:4
.
Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; -- ephesians 3:5
.
That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: -- ephesians 3:6
.
Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. -- ephesians 3:7
.
Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; -- ephesians 3:8
.
And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: -- ephesians 3:9
.
To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, -- ephesians 3:10
.
According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: -- ephesians 3:11
.
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. -- ephesians 3:12
.
Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. -- ephesians 3:13
.
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, -- ephesians 3:14
.
Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, -- ephesians 3:15
.
That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; -- ephesians 3:16
.
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, -- ephesians 3:17
.
May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; -- ephesians 3:18
.
And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. -- ephesians 3:19
.
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, -- ephesians 3:20
.
Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. -- ephesians 3:21
.
I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, -- ephesians 4:1
.
With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; -- ephesians 4:2
.
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. -- ephesians 4:3
.
There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; -- ephesians 4:4
.
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, -- ephesians 4:5
.
One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. -- ephesians 4:6
.
But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. -- ephesians 4:7
.
Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. -- ephesians 4:8
.
(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? -- ephesians 4:9
.
He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) -- ephesians 4:10
.
And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; -- ephesians 4:11
.
For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: -- ephesians 4:12
.
Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: -- ephesians 4:13
.
That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; -- ephesians 4:14
.
But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: -- ephesians 4:15
.
From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. -- ephesians 4:16
.
This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, -- ephesians 4:17
.
Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: -- ephesians 4:18
.
Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. -- ephesians 4:19
.
But ye have not so learned Christ; -- ephesians 4:20
.
If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: -- ephesians 4:21
.
That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; -- ephesians 4:22
.
And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; -- ephesians 4:23
.
And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. -- ephesians 4:24
.
Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. -- ephesians 4:25
.
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: -- ephesians 4:26
.
Neither give place to the devil. -- ephesians 4:27
.
Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. -- ephesians 4:28
.
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. -- ephesians 4:29
.
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. -- ephesians 4:30
.
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: -- ephesians 4:31
.
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- ephesians 4:32
.
Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; -- ephesians 5:1
.
And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. -- ephesians 5:2
.
But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; -- ephesians 5:3
.
Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. -- ephesians 5:4
.
For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. -- ephesians 5:5
.
Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. -- ephesians 5:6
.
Be not ye therefore partakers with them. -- ephesians 5:7
.
For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: -- ephesians 5:8
.
(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) -- ephesians 5:9
.
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. -- ephesians 5:10
.
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. -- ephesians 5:11
.
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. -- ephesians 5:12
.
But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. -- ephesians 5:13
.
Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. -- ephesians 5:14
.
See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, -- ephesians 5:15
.
Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. -- ephesians 5:16
.
Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. -- ephesians 5:17
.
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; -- ephesians 5:18
.
Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; -- ephesians 5:19
.
Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; -- ephesians 5:20
.
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. -- ephesians 5:21
.
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. -- ephesians 5:22
.
For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. -- ephesians 5:23
.
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. -- ephesians 5:24
.
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; -- ephesians 5:25
.
That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, -- ephesians 5:26
.
That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. -- ephesians 5:27
.
So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. -- ephesians 5:28
.
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: -- ephesians 5:29
.
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. -- ephesians 5:30
.
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. -- ephesians 5:31
.
This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. -- ephesians 5:32
.
Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. -- ephesians 5:33
.
Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. -- ephesians 6:1
.
Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; -- ephesians 6:2
.
That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. -- ephesians 6:3
.
And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. -- ephesians 6:4
.
Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; -- ephesians 6:5
.
Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; -- ephesians 6:6
.
With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: -- ephesians 6:7
.
Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. -- ephesians 6:8
.
And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. -- ephesians 6:9
.
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. -- ephesians 6:10
.
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. -- ephesians 6:11
.
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. -- ephesians 6:12
.
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. -- ephesians 6:13
.
Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; -- ephesians 6:14
.
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; -- ephesians 6:15
.
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. -- ephesians 6:16
.
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: -- ephesians 6:17
.
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; -- ephesians 6:18
.
And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, -- ephesians 6:19
.
For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. -- ephesians 6:20
.
But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: -- ephesians 6:21
.
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. -- ephesians 6:22
.
Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- ephesians 6:23
.
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. -- ephesians 6:24
.
Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: -- philippians 1:1
.
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. -- philippians 1:2
.
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, -- philippians 1:3
.
Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, -- philippians 1:4
.
For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; -- philippians 1:5
.
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: -- philippians 1:6
.
Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. -- philippians 1:7
.
For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. -- philippians 1:8
.
And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; -- philippians 1:9
.
That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ. -- philippians 1:10
.
Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. -- philippians 1:11
.
But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; -- philippians 1:12
.
So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; -- philippians 1:13
.
And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. -- philippians 1:14
.
Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: -- philippians 1:15
.
The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: -- philippians 1:16
.
But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. -- philippians 1:17
.
What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. -- philippians 1:18
.
For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, -- philippians 1:19
.
According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. -- philippians 1:20
.
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. -- philippians 1:21
.
But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. -- philippians 1:22
.
For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: -- philippians 1:23
.
Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. -- philippians 1:24
.
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; -- philippians 1:25
.
That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. -- philippians 1:26
.
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; -- philippians 1:27
.
And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. -- philippians 1:28
.
For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; -- philippians 1:29
.
Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me. -- philippians 1:30
.
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, -- philippians 2:1
.
Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. -- philippians 2:2
.
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. -- philippians 2:3
.
Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. -- philippians 2:4
.
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: -- philippians 2:5
.
Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: -- philippians 2:6
.
But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: -- philippians 2:7
.
And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. -- philippians 2:8
.
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: -- philippians 2:9
.
That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; -- philippians 2:10
.
And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. -- philippians 2:11
.
Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. -- philippians 2:12
.
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. -- philippians 2:13
.
Do all things without murmurings and disputings: -- philippians 2:14
.
That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; -- philippians 2:15
.
Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. -- philippians 2:16
.
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. -- philippians 2:17
.
For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. -- philippians 2:18
.
But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. -- philippians 2:19
.
For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. -- philippians 2:20
.
For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. -- philippians 2:21
.
But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. -- philippians 2:22
.
Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. -- philippians 2:23
.
But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. -- philippians 2:24
.
Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. -- philippians 2:25
.
For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. -- philippians 2:26
.
For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. -- philippians 2:27
.
I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. -- philippians 2:28
.
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: -- philippians 2:29
.
Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me. -- philippians 2:30
.
Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe. -- philippians 3:1
.
Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. -- philippians 3:2
.
For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. -- philippians 3:3
.
Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: -- philippians 3:4
.
Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; -- philippians 3:5
.
Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. -- philippians 3:6
.
But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. -- philippians 3:7
.
Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, -- philippians 3:8
.
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: -- philippians 3:9
.
That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; -- philippians 3:10
.
If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. -- philippians 3:11
.
Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. -- philippians 3:12
.
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, -- philippians 3:13
.
I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. -- philippians 3:14
.
Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. -- philippians 3:15
.
Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. -- philippians 3:16
.
Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. -- philippians 3:17
.
(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: -- philippians 3:18
.
Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) -- philippians 3:19
.
For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: -- philippians 3:20
.
Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. -- philippians 3:21
.
Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. -- philippians 4:1
.
I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. -- philippians 4:2
.
And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life. -- philippians 4:3
.
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. -- philippians 4:4
.
Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. -- philippians 4:5
.
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. -- philippians 4:6
.
And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. -- philippians 4:7
.
Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. -- philippians 4:8
.
Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. -- philippians 4:9
.
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. -- philippians 4:10
.
Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. -- philippians 4:11
.
I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. -- philippians 4:12
.
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. -- philippians 4:13
.
Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. -- philippians 4:14
.
Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. -- philippians 4:15
.
For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. -- philippians 4:16
.
Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. -- philippians 4:17
.
But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. -- philippians 4:18
.
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. -- philippians 4:19
.
Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. -- philippians 4:20
.
Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. -- philippians 4:21
.
All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household. -- philippians 4:22
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. -- philippians 4:23
.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother, -- colossians 1:1
.
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- colossians 1:2
.
We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, -- colossians 1:3
.
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints, -- colossians 1:4
.
For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; -- colossians 1:5
.
Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: -- colossians 1:6
.
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; -- colossians 1:7
.
Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. -- colossians 1:8
.
For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; -- colossians 1:9
.
That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; -- colossians 1:10
.
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; -- colossians 1:11
.
Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: -- colossians 1:12
.
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: -- colossians 1:13
.
In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: -- colossians 1:14
.
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: -- colossians 1:15
.
For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: -- colossians 1:16
.
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. -- colossians 1:17
.
And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. -- colossians 1:18
.
For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; -- colossians 1:19
.
And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. -- colossians 1:20
.
And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled -- colossians 1:21
.
In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight: -- colossians 1:22
.
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; -- colossians 1:23
.
Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church: -- colossians 1:24
.
Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; -- colossians 1:25
.
Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: -- colossians 1:26
.
To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: -- colossians 1:27
.
Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: -- colossians 1:28
.
Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily. -- colossians 1:29
.
For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; -- colossians 2:1
.
That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; -- colossians 2:2
.
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. -- colossians 2:3
.
And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. -- colossians 2:4
.
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. -- colossians 2:5
.
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: -- colossians 2:6
.
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. -- colossians 2:7
.
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. -- colossians 2:8
.
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. -- colossians 2:9
.
And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: -- colossians 2:10
.
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: -- colossians 2:11
.
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. -- colossians 2:12
.
And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; -- colossians 2:13
.
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; -- colossians 2:14
.
And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. -- colossians 2:15
.
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: -- colossians 2:16
.
Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. -- colossians 2:17
.
Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, -- colossians 2:18
.
And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God. -- colossians 2:19
.
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, -- colossians 2:20
.
(Touch not; taste not; handle not; -- colossians 2:21
.
Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? -- colossians 2:22
.
Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh. -- colossians 2:23
.
If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. -- colossians 3:1
.
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. -- colossians 3:2
.
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. -- colossians 3:3
.
When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. -- colossians 3:4
.
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: -- colossians 3:5
.
For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: -- colossians 3:6
.
In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. -- colossians 3:7
.
But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. -- colossians 3:8
.
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; -- colossians 3:9
.
And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: -- colossians 3:10
.
Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. -- colossians 3:11
.
Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; -- colossians 3:12
.
Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. -- colossians 3:13
.
And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. -- colossians 3:14
.
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. -- colossians 3:15
.
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. -- colossians 3:16
.
And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. -- colossians 3:17
.
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. -- colossians 3:18
.
Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. -- colossians 3:19
.
Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. -- colossians 3:20
.
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. -- colossians 3:21
.
Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God; -- colossians 3:22
.
And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; -- colossians 3:23
.
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. -- colossians 3:24
.
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons. -- colossians 3:25
.
Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. -- colossians 4:1
.
Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; -- colossians 4:2
.
Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: -- colossians 4:3
.
That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. -- colossians 4:4
.
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. -- colossians 4:5
.
Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. -- colossians 4:6
.
All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: -- colossians 4:7
.
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; -- colossians 4:8
.
With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here. -- colossians 4:9
.
Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;) -- colossians 4:10
.
And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me. -- colossians 4:11
.
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. -- colossians 4:12
.
For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. -- colossians 4:13
.
Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. -- colossians 4:14
.
Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. -- colossians 4:15
.
And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. -- colossians 4:16
.
And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. -- colossians 4:17
.
The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen. -- colossians 4:18
.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 thessalonians 1:1
.
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; -- 1 thessalonians 1:2
.
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; -- 1 thessalonians 1:3
.
Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. -- 1 thessalonians 1:4
.
For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. -- 1 thessalonians 1:5
.
And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost. -- 1 thessalonians 1:6
.
So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. -- 1 thessalonians 1:7
.
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. -- 1 thessalonians 1:8
.
For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; -- 1 thessalonians 1:9
.
And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come. -- 1 thessalonians 1:10
.
For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain: -- 1 thessalonians 2:1
.
But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention. -- 1 thessalonians 2:2
.
For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile: -- 1 thessalonians 2:3
.
But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. -- 1 thessalonians 2:4
.
For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness: -- 1 thessalonians 2:5
.
Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. -- 1 thessalonians 2:6
.
But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: -- 1 thessalonians 2:7
.
So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us. -- 1 thessalonians 2:8
.
For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. -- 1 thessalonians 2:9
.
Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe: -- 1 thessalonians 2:10
.
As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children, -- 1 thessalonians 2:11
.
That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory. -- 1 thessalonians 2:12
.
For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe. -- 1 thessalonians 2:13
.
For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: -- 1 thessalonians 2:14
.
Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: -- 1 thessalonians 2:15
.
Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. -- 1 thessalonians 2:16
.
But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. -- 1 thessalonians 2:17
.
Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us. -- 1 thessalonians 2:18
.
For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? -- 1 thessalonians 2:19
.
For ye are our glory and joy. -- 1 thessalonians 2:20
.
Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone; -- 1 thessalonians 3:1
.
And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: -- 1 thessalonians 3:2
.
That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. -- 1 thessalonians 3:3
.
For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know. -- 1 thessalonians 3:4
.
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. -- 1 thessalonians 3:5
.
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you: -- 1 thessalonians 3:6
.
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: -- 1 thessalonians 3:7
.
For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. -- 1 thessalonians 3:8
.
For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; -- 1 thessalonians 3:9
.
Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? -- 1 thessalonians 3:10
.
Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you. -- 1 thessalonians 3:11
.
And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: -- 1 thessalonians 3:12
.
To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. -- 1 thessalonians 3:13
.
Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more. -- 1 thessalonians 4:1
.
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. -- 1 thessalonians 4:2
.
For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: -- 1 thessalonians 4:3
.
That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; -- 1 thessalonians 4:4
.
Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: -- 1 thessalonians 4:5
.
That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. -- 1 thessalonians 4:6
.
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. -- 1 thessalonians 4:7
.
He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. -- 1 thessalonians 4:8
.
But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. -- 1 thessalonians 4:9
.
And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; -- 1 thessalonians 4:10
.
And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; -- 1 thessalonians 4:11
.
That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing. -- 1 thessalonians 4:12
.
But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. -- 1 thessalonians 4:13
.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. -- 1 thessalonians 4:14
.
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. -- 1 thessalonians 4:15
.
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: -- 1 thessalonians 4:16
.
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. -- 1 thessalonians 4:17
.
Wherefore comfort one another with these words. -- 1 thessalonians 4:18
.
But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. -- 1 thessalonians 5:1
.
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. -- 1 thessalonians 5:2
.
For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. -- 1 thessalonians 5:3
.
But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. -- 1 thessalonians 5:4
.
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. -- 1 thessalonians 5:5
.
Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. -- 1 thessalonians 5:6
.
For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. -- 1 thessalonians 5:7
.
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. -- 1 thessalonians 5:8
.
For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, -- 1 thessalonians 5:9
.
Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. -- 1 thessalonians 5:10
.
Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. -- 1 thessalonians 5:11
.
And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; -- 1 thessalonians 5:12
.
And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. -- 1 thessalonians 5:13
.
Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. -- 1 thessalonians 5:14
.
See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. -- 1 thessalonians 5:15
.
Rejoice evermore. -- 1 thessalonians 5:16
.
Pray without ceasing. -- 1 thessalonians 5:17
.
In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. -- 1 thessalonians 5:18
.
Quench not the Spirit. -- 1 thessalonians 5:19
.
Despise not prophesyings. -- 1 thessalonians 5:20
.
Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. -- 1 thessalonians 5:21
.
Abstain from all appearance of evil. -- 1 thessalonians 5:22
.
And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 thessalonians 5:23
.
Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. -- 1 thessalonians 5:24
.
Brethren, pray for us. -- 1 thessalonians 5:25
.
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. -- 1 thessalonians 5:26
.
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. -- 1 thessalonians 5:27
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. -- 1 thessalonians 5:28
.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: -- 2 thessalonians 1:1
.
Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 1:2
.
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; -- 2 thessalonians 1:3
.
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: -- 2 thessalonians 1:4
.
Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: -- 2 thessalonians 1:5
.
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; -- 2 thessalonians 1:6
.
And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, -- 2 thessalonians 1:7
.
In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: -- 2 thessalonians 1:8
.
Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; -- 2 thessalonians 1:9
.
When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day. -- 2 thessalonians 1:10
.
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power: -- 2 thessalonians 1:11
.
That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 1:12
.
Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, -- 2 thessalonians 2:1
.
That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. -- 2 thessalonians 2:2
.
Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; -- 2 thessalonians 2:3
.
Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. -- 2 thessalonians 2:4
.
Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? -- 2 thessalonians 2:5
.
And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. -- 2 thessalonians 2:6
.
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. -- 2 thessalonians 2:7
.
And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: -- 2 thessalonians 2:8
.
Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, -- 2 thessalonians 2:9
.
And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. -- 2 thessalonians 2:10
.
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: -- 2 thessalonians 2:11
.
That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. -- 2 thessalonians 2:12
.
But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: -- 2 thessalonians 2:13
.
Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 2:14
.
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. -- 2 thessalonians 2:15
.
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, -- 2 thessalonians 2:16
.
Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work. -- 2 thessalonians 2:17
.
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: -- 2 thessalonians 3:1
.
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith. -- 2 thessalonians 3:2
.
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. -- 2 thessalonians 3:3
.
And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. -- 2 thessalonians 3:4
.
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 3:5
.
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. -- 2 thessalonians 3:6
.
For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; -- 2 thessalonians 3:7
.
Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: -- 2 thessalonians 3:8
.
Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us. -- 2 thessalonians 3:9
.
For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. -- 2 thessalonians 3:10
.
For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. -- 2 thessalonians 3:11
.
Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. -- 2 thessalonians 3:12
.
But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. -- 2 thessalonians 3:13
.
And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. -- 2 thessalonians 3:14
.
Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. -- 2 thessalonians 3:15
.
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all. -- 2 thessalonians 3:16
.
The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. -- 2 thessalonians 3:17
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. -- 2 thessalonians 3:18
.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; -- 1 timothy 1:1
.
Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. -- 1 timothy 1:2
.
As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, -- 1 timothy 1:3
.
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do. -- 1 timothy 1:4
.
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: -- 1 timothy 1:5
.
From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; -- 1 timothy 1:6
.
Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm. -- 1 timothy 1:7
.
But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; -- 1 timothy 1:8
.
Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, -- 1 timothy 1:9
.
For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; -- 1 timothy 1:10
.
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. -- 1 timothy 1:11
.
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; -- 1 timothy 1:12
.
Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. -- 1 timothy 1:13
.
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. -- 1 timothy 1:14
.
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. -- 1 timothy 1:15
.
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. -- 1 timothy 1:16
.
Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. -- 1 timothy 1:17
.
This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; -- 1 timothy 1:18
.
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: -- 1 timothy 1:19
.
Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. -- 1 timothy 1:20
.
I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; -- 1 timothy 2:1
.
For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. -- 1 timothy 2:2
.
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; -- 1 timothy 2:3
.
Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. -- 1 timothy 2:4
.
For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; -- 1 timothy 2:5
.
Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. -- 1 timothy 2:6
.
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. -- 1 timothy 2:7
.
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. -- 1 timothy 2:8
.
In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; -- 1 timothy 2:9
.
But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. -- 1 timothy 2:10
.
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. -- 1 timothy 2:11
.
But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. -- 1 timothy 2:12
.
For Adam was first formed, then Eve. -- 1 timothy 2:13
.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. -- 1 timothy 2:14
.
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. -- 1 timothy 2:15
.
This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. -- 1 timothy 3:1
.
A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; -- 1 timothy 3:2
.
Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; -- 1 timothy 3:3
.
One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; -- 1 timothy 3:4
.
(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) -- 1 timothy 3:5
.
Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. -- 1 timothy 3:6
.
Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. -- 1 timothy 3:7
.
Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; -- 1 timothy 3:8
.
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. -- 1 timothy 3:9
.
And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. -- 1 timothy 3:10
.
Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. -- 1 timothy 3:11
.
Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. -- 1 timothy 3:12
.
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. -- 1 timothy 3:13
.
These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: -- 1 timothy 3:14
.
But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. -- 1 timothy 3:15
.
And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. -- 1 timothy 3:16
.
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; -- 1 timothy 4:1
.
Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; -- 1 timothy 4:2
.
Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. -- 1 timothy 4:3
.
For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: -- 1 timothy 4:4
.
For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. -- 1 timothy 4:5
.
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. -- 1 timothy 4:6
.
But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. -- 1 timothy 4:7
.
For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. -- 1 timothy 4:8
.
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. -- 1 timothy 4:9
.
For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe. -- 1 timothy 4:10
.
These things command and teach. -- 1 timothy 4:11
.
Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. -- 1 timothy 4:12
.
Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. -- 1 timothy 4:13
.
Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. -- 1 timothy 4:14
.
Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. -- 1 timothy 4:15
.
Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee. -- 1 timothy 4:16
.
Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; -- 1 timothy 5:1
.
The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. -- 1 timothy 5:2
.
Honour widows that are widows indeed. -- 1 timothy 5:3
.
But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God. -- 1 timothy 5:4
.
Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. -- 1 timothy 5:5
.
But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. -- 1 timothy 5:6
.
And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless. -- 1 timothy 5:7
.
But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. -- 1 timothy 5:8
.
Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man. -- 1 timothy 5:9
.
Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. -- 1 timothy 5:10
.
But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; -- 1 timothy 5:11
.
Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. -- 1 timothy 5:12
.
And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. -- 1 timothy 5:13
.
I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. -- 1 timothy 5:14
.
For some are already turned aside after Satan. -- 1 timothy 5:15
.
If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed. -- 1 timothy 5:16
.
Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. -- 1 timothy 5:17
.
For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward. -- 1 timothy 5:18
.
Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses. -- 1 timothy 5:19
.
Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. -- 1 timothy 5:20
.
I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. -- 1 timothy 5:21
.
Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure. -- 1 timothy 5:22
.
Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities. -- 1 timothy 5:23
.
Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after. -- 1 timothy 5:24
.
Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. -- 1 timothy 5:25
.
Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. -- 1 timothy 6:1
.
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. -- 1 timothy 6:2
.
If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; -- 1 timothy 6:3
.
He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, -- 1 timothy 6:4
.
Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. -- 1 timothy 6:5
.
But godliness with contentment is great gain. -- 1 timothy 6:6
.
For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. -- 1 timothy 6:7
.
And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. -- 1 timothy 6:8
.
But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. -- 1 timothy 6:9
.
For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. -- 1 timothy 6:10
.
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. -- 1 timothy 6:11
.
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. -- 1 timothy 6:12
.
I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; -- 1 timothy 6:13
.
That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: -- 1 timothy 6:14
.
Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; -- 1 timothy 6:15
.
Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen. -- 1 timothy 6:16
.
Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; -- 1 timothy 6:17
.
That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; -- 1 timothy 6:18
.
Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. -- 1 timothy 6:19
.
O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: -- 1 timothy 6:20
.
Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen. -- 1 timothy 6:21
.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, -- 2 timothy 1:1
.
To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. -- 2 timothy 1:2
.
I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; -- 2 timothy 1:3
.
Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; -- 2 timothy 1:4
.
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. -- 2 timothy 1:5
.
Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. -- 2 timothy 1:6
.
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. -- 2 timothy 1:7
.
Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; -- 2 timothy 1:8
.
Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, -- 2 timothy 1:9
.
But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: -- 2 timothy 1:10
.
Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. -- 2 timothy 1:11
.
For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. -- 2 timothy 1:12
.
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 1:13
.
That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. -- 2 timothy 1:14
.
This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. -- 2 timothy 1:15
.
The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: -- 2 timothy 1:16
.
But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. -- 2 timothy 1:17
.
The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. -- 2 timothy 1:18
.
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 2:1
.
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. -- 2 timothy 2:2
.
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. -- 2 timothy 2:3
.
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. -- 2 timothy 2:4
.
And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. -- 2 timothy 2:5
.
The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. -- 2 timothy 2:6
.
Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. -- 2 timothy 2:7
.
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: -- 2 timothy 2:8
.
Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. -- 2 timothy 2:9
.
Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. -- 2 timothy 2:10
.
It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: -- 2 timothy 2:11
.
If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: -- 2 timothy 2:12
.
If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. -- 2 timothy 2:13
.
Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. -- 2 timothy 2:14
.
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. -- 2 timothy 2:15
.
But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. -- 2 timothy 2:16
.
And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; -- 2 timothy 2:17
.
Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. -- 2 timothy 2:18
.
Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. -- 2 timothy 2:19
.
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. -- 2 timothy 2:20
.
If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work. -- 2 timothy 2:21
.
Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. -- 2 timothy 2:22
.
But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. -- 2 timothy 2:23
.
And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, -- 2 timothy 2:24
.
In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; -- 2 timothy 2:25
.
And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. -- 2 timothy 2:26
.
This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. -- 2 timothy 3:1
.
For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, -- 2 timothy 3:2
.
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, -- 2 timothy 3:3
.
Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; -- 2 timothy 3:4
.
Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. -- 2 timothy 3:5
.
For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, -- 2 timothy 3:6
.
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. -- 2 timothy 3:7
.
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. -- 2 timothy 3:8
.
But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was. -- 2 timothy 3:9
.
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, -- 2 timothy 3:10
.
Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. -- 2 timothy 3:11
.
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. -- 2 timothy 3:12
.
But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. -- 2 timothy 3:13
.
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; -- 2 timothy 3:14
.
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 3:15
.
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: -- 2 timothy 3:16
.
That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. -- 2 timothy 3:17
.
I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; -- 2 timothy 4:1
.
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. -- 2 timothy 4:2
.
For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; -- 2 timothy 4:3
.
And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. -- 2 timothy 4:4
.
But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. -- 2 timothy 4:5
.
For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. -- 2 timothy 4:6
.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: -- 2 timothy 4:7
.
Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. -- 2 timothy 4:8
.
Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: -- 2 timothy 4:9
.
For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. -- 2 timothy 4:10
.
Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. -- 2 timothy 4:11
.
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. -- 2 timothy 4:12
.
The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments. -- 2 timothy 4:13
.
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: -- 2 timothy 4:14
.
Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. -- 2 timothy 4:15
.
At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. -- 2 timothy 4:16
.
Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. -- 2 timothy 4:17
.
And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. -- 2 timothy 4:18
.
Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. -- 2 timothy 4:19
.
Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. -- 2 timothy 4:20
.
Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. -- 2 timothy 4:21
.
The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. -- 2 timothy 4:22
.
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; -- titus 1:1
.
In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; -- titus 1:2
.
But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; -- titus 1:3
.
To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. -- titus 1:4
.
For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: -- titus 1:5
.
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. -- titus 1:6
.
For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; -- titus 1:7
.
But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; -- titus 1:8
.
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. -- titus 1:9
.
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: -- titus 1:10
.
Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. -- titus 1:11
.
One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. -- titus 1:12
.
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; -- titus 1:13
.
Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. -- titus 1:14
.
Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. -- titus 1:15
.
They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. -- titus 1:16
.
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: -- titus 2:1
.
That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. -- titus 2:2
.
The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; -- titus 2:3
.
That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, -- titus 2:4
.
To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. -- titus 2:5
.
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. -- titus 2:6
.
In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, -- titus 2:7
.
Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. -- titus 2:8
.
Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; -- titus 2:9
.
Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. -- titus 2:10
.
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, -- titus 2:11
.
Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; -- titus 2:12
.
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; -- titus 2:13
.
Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. -- titus 2:14
.
These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. -- titus 2:15
.
Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, -- titus 3:1
.
To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. -- titus 3:2
.
For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. -- titus 3:3
.
But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, -- titus 3:4
.
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; -- titus 3:5
.
Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; -- titus 3:6
.
That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. -- titus 3:7
.
This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. -- titus 3:8
.
But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. -- titus 3:9
.
A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; -- titus 3:10
.
Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. -- titus 3:11
.
When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. -- titus 3:12
.
Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. -- titus 3:13
.
And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. -- titus 3:14
.
All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. -- titus 3:15
.
Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, -- philemon 1:1
.
And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: -- philemon 1:2
.
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- philemon 1:3
.
I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, -- philemon 1:4
.
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; -- philemon 1:5
.
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. -- philemon 1:6
.
For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. -- philemon 1:7
.
Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, -- philemon 1:8
.
Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. -- philemon 1:9
.
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: -- philemon 1:10
.
Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: -- philemon 1:11
.
Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: -- philemon 1:12
.
Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: -- philemon 1:13
.
But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. -- philemon 1:14
.
For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; -- philemon 1:15
.
Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? -- philemon 1:16
.
If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. -- philemon 1:17
.
If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; -- philemon 1:18
.
I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. -- philemon 1:19
.
Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. -- philemon 1:20
.
Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. -- philemon 1:21
.
But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. -- philemon 1:22
.
There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; -- philemon 1:23
.
Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. -- philemon 1:24
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. -- philemon 1:25
.
God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, -- hebrews 1:1
.
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; -- hebrews 1:2
.
Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high: -- hebrews 1:3
.
Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. -- hebrews 1:4
.
For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? -- hebrews 1:5
.
And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. -- hebrews 1:6
.
And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. -- hebrews 1:7
.
But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. -- hebrews 1:8
.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. -- hebrews 1:9
.
And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: -- hebrews 1:10
.
They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; -- hebrews 1:11
.
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. -- hebrews 1:12
.
But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? -- hebrews 1:13
.
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? -- hebrews 1:14
.
Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. -- hebrews 2:1
.
For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; -- hebrews 2:2
.
How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; -- hebrews 2:3
.
God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? -- hebrews 2:4
.
For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. -- hebrews 2:5
.
But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him? -- hebrews 2:6
.
Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: -- hebrews 2:7
.
Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. -- hebrews 2:8
.
But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. -- hebrews 2:9
.
For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. -- hebrews 2:10
.
For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, -- hebrews 2:11
.
Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. -- hebrews 2:12
.
And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. -- hebrews 2:13
.
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; -- hebrews 2:14
.
And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. -- hebrews 2:15
.
For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. -- hebrews 2:16
.
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. -- hebrews 2:17
.
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. -- hebrews 2:18
.
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; -- hebrews 3:1
.
Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. -- hebrews 3:2
.
For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. -- hebrews 3:3
.
For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God. -- hebrews 3:4
.
And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; -- hebrews 3:5
.
But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. -- hebrews 3:6
.
Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, -- hebrews 3:7
.
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: -- hebrews 3:8
.
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. -- hebrews 3:9
.
Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. -- hebrews 3:10
.
So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) -- hebrews 3:11
.
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. -- hebrews 3:12
.
But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. -- hebrews 3:13
.
For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; -- hebrews 3:14
.
While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. -- hebrews 3:15
.
For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. -- hebrews 3:16
.
But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? -- hebrews 3:17
.
And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? -- hebrews 3:18
.
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. -- hebrews 3:19
.
Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. -- hebrews 4:1
.
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. -- hebrews 4:2
.
For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. -- hebrews 4:3
.
For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. -- hebrews 4:4
.
And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. -- hebrews 4:5
.
Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: -- hebrews 4:6
.
Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. -- hebrews 4:7
.
For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. -- hebrews 4:8
.
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. -- hebrews 4:9
.
For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. -- hebrews 4:10
.
Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. -- hebrews 4:11
.
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. -- hebrews 4:12
.
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. -- hebrews 4:13
.
Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. -- hebrews 4:14
.
For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. -- hebrews 4:15
.
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. -- hebrews 4:16
.
For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: -- hebrews 5:1
.
Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. -- hebrews 5:2
.
And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. -- hebrews 5:3
.
And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. -- hebrews 5:4
.
So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. -- hebrews 5:5
.
As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. -- hebrews 5:6
.
Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; -- hebrews 5:7
.
Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; -- hebrews 5:8
.
And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; -- hebrews 5:9
.
Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. -- hebrews 5:10
.
Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. -- hebrews 5:11
.
For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. -- hebrews 5:12
.
For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. -- hebrews 5:13
.
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. -- hebrews 5:14
.
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, -- hebrews 6:1
.
Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. -- hebrews 6:2
.
And this will we do, if God permit. -- hebrews 6:3
.
For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, -- hebrews 6:4
.
And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, -- hebrews 6:5
.
If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. -- hebrews 6:6
.
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: -- hebrews 6:7
.
But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. -- hebrews 6:8
.
But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. -- hebrews 6:9
.
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. -- hebrews 6:10
.
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: -- hebrews 6:11
.
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. -- hebrews 6:12
.
For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, -- hebrews 6:13
.
Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. -- hebrews 6:14
.
And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. -- hebrews 6:15
.
For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. -- hebrews 6:16
.
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: -- hebrews 6:17
.
That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: -- hebrews 6:18
.
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; -- hebrews 6:19
.
Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. -- hebrews 6:20
.
For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; -- hebrews 7:1
.
To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; -- hebrews 7:2
.
Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. -- hebrews 7:3
.
Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. -- hebrews 7:4
.
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: -- hebrews 7:5
.
But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. -- hebrews 7:6
.
And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. -- hebrews 7:7
.
And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. -- hebrews 7:8
.
And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. -- hebrews 7:9
.
For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. -- hebrews 7:10
.
If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? -- hebrews 7:11
.
For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. -- hebrews 7:12
.
For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. -- hebrews 7:13
.
For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. -- hebrews 7:14
.
And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, -- hebrews 7:15
.
Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. -- hebrews 7:16
.
For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. -- hebrews 7:17
.
For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. -- hebrews 7:18
.
For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. -- hebrews 7:19
.
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: -- hebrews 7:20
.
(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) -- hebrews 7:21
.
By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. -- hebrews 7:22
.
And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: -- hebrews 7:23
.
But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. -- hebrews 7:24
.
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- hebrews 7:25
.
For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; -- hebrews 7:26
.
Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. -- hebrews 7:27
.
For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. -- hebrews 7:28
.
Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; -- hebrews 8:1
.
A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. -- hebrews 8:2
.
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. -- hebrews 8:3
.
For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: -- hebrews 8:4
.
Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. -- hebrews 8:5
.
But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. -- hebrews 8:6
.
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. -- hebrews 8:7
.
For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: -- hebrews 8:8
.
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. -- hebrews 8:9
.
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: -- hebrews 8:10
.
And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. -- hebrews 8:11
.
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. -- hebrews 8:12
.
In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away. -- hebrews 8:13
.
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. -- hebrews 9:1
.
For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. -- hebrews 9:2
.
And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; -- hebrews 9:3
.
Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; -- hebrews 9:4
.
And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. -- hebrews 9:5
.
Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. -- hebrews 9:6
.
But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: -- hebrews 9:7
.
The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: -- hebrews 9:8
.
Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; -- hebrews 9:9
.
Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. -- hebrews 9:10
.
But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; -- hebrews 9:11
.
Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. -- hebrews 9:12
.
For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: -- hebrews 9:13
.
How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? -- hebrews 9:14
.
And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. -- hebrews 9:15
.
For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. -- hebrews 9:16
.
For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. -- hebrews 9:17
.
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. -- hebrews 9:18
.
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, -- hebrews 9:19
.
Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. -- hebrews 9:20
.
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. -- hebrews 9:21
.
And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. -- hebrews 9:22
.
It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. -- hebrews 9:23
.
For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: -- hebrews 9:24
.
Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; -- hebrews 9:25
.
For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. -- hebrews 9:26
.
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: -- hebrews 9:27
.
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. -- hebrews 9:28
.
For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. -- hebrews 10:1
.
For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. -- hebrews 10:2
.
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. -- hebrews 10:3
.
For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. -- hebrews 10:4
.
Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: -- hebrews 10:5
.
In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. -- hebrews 10:6
.
Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. -- hebrews 10:7
.
Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; -- hebrews 10:8
.
Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. -- hebrews 10:9
.
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. -- hebrews 10:10
.
And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: -- hebrews 10:11
.
But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; -- hebrews 10:12
.
From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. -- hebrews 10:13
.
For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. -- hebrews 10:14
.
Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, -- hebrews 10:15
.
This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; -- hebrews 10:16
.
And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. -- hebrews 10:17
.
Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. -- hebrews 10:18
.
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, -- hebrews 10:19
.
By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; -- hebrews 10:20
.
And having an high priest over the house of God; -- hebrews 10:21
.
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. -- hebrews 10:22
.
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) -- hebrews 10:23
.
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: -- hebrews 10:24
.
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. -- hebrews 10:25
.
For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, -- hebrews 10:26
.
But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. -- hebrews 10:27
.
He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: -- hebrews 10:28
.
Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? -- hebrews 10:29
.
For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. -- hebrews 10:30
.
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. -- hebrews 10:31
.
But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; -- hebrews 10:32
.
Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. -- hebrews 10:33
.
For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. -- hebrews 10:34
.
Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. -- hebrews 10:35
.
For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. -- hebrews 10:36
.
For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. -- hebrews 10:37
.
Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. -- hebrews 10:38
.
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. -- hebrews 10:39
.
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. -- hebrews 11:1
.
For by it the elders obtained a good report. -- hebrews 11:2
.
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. -- hebrews 11:3
.
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. -- hebrews 11:4
.
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. -- hebrews 11:5
.
But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. -- hebrews 11:6
.
By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. -- hebrews 11:7
.
By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. -- hebrews 11:8
.
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: -- hebrews 11:9
.
For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. -- hebrews 11:10
.
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. -- hebrews 11:11
.
Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. -- hebrews 11:12
.
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. -- hebrews 11:13
.
For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. -- hebrews 11:14
.
And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. -- hebrews 11:15
.
But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. -- hebrews 11:16
.
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, -- hebrews 11:17
.
Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: -- hebrews 11:18
.
Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. -- hebrews 11:19
.
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. -- hebrews 11:20
.
By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff. -- hebrews 11:21
.
By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. -- hebrews 11:22
.
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. -- hebrews 11:23
.
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; -- hebrews 11:24
.
Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; -- hebrews 11:25
.
Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. -- hebrews 11:26
.
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. -- hebrews 11:27
.
Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. -- hebrews 11:28
.
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. -- hebrews 11:29
.
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. -- hebrews 11:30
.
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. -- hebrews 11:31
.
And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: -- hebrews 11:32
.
Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions. -- hebrews 11:33
.
Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. -- hebrews 11:34
.
Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: -- hebrews 11:35
.
And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: -- hebrews 11:36
.
They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; -- hebrews 11:37
.
(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. -- hebrews 11:38
.
And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: -- hebrews 11:39
.
God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect. -- hebrews 11:40
.
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, -- hebrews 12:1
.
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. -- hebrews 12:2
.
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. -- hebrews 12:3
.
Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. -- hebrews 12:4
.
And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: -- hebrews 12:5
.
For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. -- hebrews 12:6
.
If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? -- hebrews 12:7
.
But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. -- hebrews 12:8
.
Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? -- hebrews 12:9
.
For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. -- hebrews 12:10
.
Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. -- hebrews 12:11
.
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; -- hebrews 12:12
.
And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. -- hebrews 12:13
.
Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: -- hebrews 12:14
.
Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; -- hebrews 12:15
.
Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. -- hebrews 12:16
.
For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. -- hebrews 12:17
.
For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, -- hebrews 12:18
.
And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: -- hebrews 12:19
.
(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: -- hebrews 12:20
.
And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:) -- hebrews 12:21
.
But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, -- hebrews 12:22
.
To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, -- hebrews 12:23
.
And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things that that of Abel. -- hebrews 12:24
.
See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: -- hebrews 12:25
.
Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. -- hebrews 12:26
.
And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. -- hebrews 12:27
.
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: -- hebrews 12:28
.
For our God is a consuming fire. -- hebrews 12:29
.
Let brotherly love continue. -- hebrews 13:1
.
Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. -- hebrews 13:2
.
Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. -- hebrews 13:3
.
Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. -- hebrews 13:4
.
Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. -- hebrews 13:5
.
So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. -- hebrews 13:6
.
Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. -- hebrews 13:7
.
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. -- hebrews 13:8
.
Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. -- hebrews 13:9
.
We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. -- hebrews 13:10
.
For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. -- hebrews 13:11
.
Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. -- hebrews 13:12
.
Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. -- hebrews 13:13
.
For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. -- hebrews 13:14
.
By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. -- hebrews 13:15
.
But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. -- hebrews 13:16
.
Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. -- hebrews 13:17
.
Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. -- hebrews 13:18
.
But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. -- hebrews 13:19
.
Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, -- hebrews 13:20
.
Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. -- hebrews 13:21
.
And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. -- hebrews 13:22
.
Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. -- hebrews 13:23
.
Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. -- hebrews 13:24
.
Grace be with you all. Amen. -- hebrews 13:25
.
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. -- james 1:1
.
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; -- james 1:2
.
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. -- james 1:3
.
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. -- james 1:4
.
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. -- james 1:5
.
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. -- james 1:6
.
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. -- james 1:7
.
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. -- james 1:8
.
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: -- james 1:9
.
But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. -- james 1:10
.
For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. -- james 1:11
.
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. -- james 1:12
.
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: -- james 1:13
.
But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. -- james 1:14
.
Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. -- james 1:15
.
Do not err, my beloved brethren. -- james 1:16
.
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. -- james 1:17
.
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. -- james 1:18
.
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: -- james 1:19
.
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. -- james 1:20
.
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. -- james 1:21
.
But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. -- james 1:22
.
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: -- james 1:23
.
For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. -- james 1:24
.
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. -- james 1:25
.
If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. -- james 1:26
.
Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. -- james 1:27
.
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. -- james 2:1
.
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; -- james 2:2
.
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: -- james 2:3
.
Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? -- james 2:4
.
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? -- james 2:5
.
But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? -- james 2:6
.
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? -- james 2:7
.
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: -- james 2:8
.
But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. -- james 2:9
.
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. -- james 2:10
.
For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. -- james 2:11
.
So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. -- james 2:12
.
For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. -- james 2:13
.
What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? -- james 2:14
.
If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, -- james 2:15
.
And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? -- james 2:16
.
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. -- james 2:17
.
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. -- james 2:18
.
Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. -- james 2:19
.
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? -- james 2:20
.
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? -- james 2:21
.
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? -- james 2:22
.
And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. -- james 2:23
.
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. -- james 2:24
.
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? -- james 2:25
.
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. -- james 2:26
.
My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. -- james 3:1
.
For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. -- james 3:2
.
Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. -- james 3:3
.
Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. -- james 3:4
.
Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! -- james 3:5
.
And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. -- james 3:6
.
For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: -- james 3:7
.
But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. -- james 3:8
.
Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. -- james 3:9
.
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. -- james 3:10
.
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? -- james 3:11
.
Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. -- james 3:12
.
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. -- james 3:13
.
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. -- james 3:14
.
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. -- james 3:15
.
For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. -- james 3:16
.
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. -- james 3:17
.
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. -- james 3:18
.
From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? -- james 4:1
.
Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. -- james 4:2
.
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. -- james 4:3
.
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. -- james 4:4
.
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? -- james 4:5
.
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. -- james 4:6
.
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. -- james 4:7
.
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. -- james 4:8
.
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. -- james 4:9
.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. -- james 4:10
.
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. -- james 4:11
.
There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? -- james 4:12
.
Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: -- james 4:13
.
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. -- james 4:14
.
For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. -- james 4:15
.
But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. -- james 4:16
.
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. -- james 4:17
.
Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. -- james 5:1
.
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. -- james 5:2
.
Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. -- james 5:3
.
Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. -- james 5:4
.
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. -- james 5:5
.
Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. -- james 5:6
.
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. -- james 5:7
.
Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. -- james 5:8
.
Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. -- james 5:9
.
Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. -- james 5:10
.
Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. -- james 5:11
.
But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. -- james 5:12
.
Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. -- james 5:13
.
Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: -- james 5:14
.
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. -- james 5:15
.
Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. -- james 5:16
.
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. -- james 5:17
.
And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. -- james 5:18
.
Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; -- james 5:19
.
Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. -- james 5:20
.
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, -- 1 peter 1:1
.
Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. -- 1 peter 1:2
.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, -- 1 peter 1:3
.
To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, -- 1 peter 1:4
.
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. -- 1 peter 1:5
.
Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: -- 1 peter 1:6
.
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: -- 1 peter 1:7
.
Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: -- 1 peter 1:8
.
Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. -- 1 peter 1:9
.
Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: -- 1 peter 1:10
.
Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. -- 1 peter 1:11
.
Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into. -- 1 peter 1:12
.
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; -- 1 peter 1:13
.
As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: -- 1 peter 1:14
.
But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; -- 1 peter 1:15
.
Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. -- 1 peter 1:16
.
And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: -- 1 peter 1:17
.
Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; -- 1 peter 1:18
.
But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: -- 1 peter 1:19
.
Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, -- 1 peter 1:20
.
Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. -- 1 peter 1:21
.
Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: -- 1 peter 1:22
.
Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. -- 1 peter 1:23
.
For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: -- 1 peter 1:24
.
But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. -- 1 peter 1:25
.
Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings, -- 1 peter 2:1
.
As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: -- 1 peter 2:2
.
If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. -- 1 peter 2:3
.
To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, -- 1 peter 2:4
.
Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. -- 1 peter 2:5
.
Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. -- 1 peter 2:6
.
Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, -- 1 peter 2:7
.
And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. -- 1 peter 2:8
.
But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; -- 1 peter 2:9
.
Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. -- 1 peter 2:10
.
Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; -- 1 peter 2:11
.
Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. -- 1 peter 2:12
.
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; -- 1 peter 2:13
.
Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. -- 1 peter 2:14
.
For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: -- 1 peter 2:15
.
As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. -- 1 peter 2:16
.
Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. -- 1 peter 2:17
.
Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. -- 1 peter 2:18
.
For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. -- 1 peter 2:19
.
For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. -- 1 peter 2:20
.
For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: -- 1 peter 2:21
.
Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: -- 1 peter 2:22
.
Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: -- 1 peter 2:23
.
Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. -- 1 peter 2:24
.
For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. -- 1 peter 2:25
.
Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; -- 1 peter 3:1
.
While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. -- 1 peter 3:2
.
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; -- 1 peter 3:3
.
But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. -- 1 peter 3:4
.
For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: -- 1 peter 3:5
.
Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. -- 1 peter 3:6
.
Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. -- 1 peter 3:7
.
Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: -- 1 peter 3:8
.
Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. -- 1 peter 3:9
.
For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: -- 1 peter 3:10
.
Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. -- 1 peter 3:11
.
For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. -- 1 peter 3:12
.
And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? -- 1 peter 3:13
.
But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; -- 1 peter 3:14
.
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: -- 1 peter 3:15
.
Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. -- 1 peter 3:16
.
For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing. -- 1 peter 3:17
.
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: -- 1 peter 3:18
.
By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; -- 1 peter 3:19
.
Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. -- 1 peter 3:20
.
The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: -- 1 peter 3:21
.
Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him. -- 1 peter 3:22
.
Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; -- 1 peter 4:1
.
That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. -- 1 peter 4:2
.
For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: -- 1 peter 4:3
.
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: -- 1 peter 4:4
.
Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. -- 1 peter 4:5
.
For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. -- 1 peter 4:6
.
But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. -- 1 peter 4:7
.
And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. -- 1 peter 4:8
.
Use hospitality one to another without grudging. -- 1 peter 4:9
.
As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. -- 1 peter 4:10
.
If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. -- 1 peter 4:11
.
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: -- 1 peter 4:12
.
But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- 1 peter 4:13
.
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. -- 1 peter 4:14
.
But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. -- 1 peter 4:15
.
Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. -- 1 peter 4:16
.
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? -- 1 peter 4:17
.
And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? -- 1 peter 4:18
.
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator. -- 1 peter 4:19
.
The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: -- 1 peter 5:1
.
Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; -- 1 peter 5:2
.
Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. -- 1 peter 5:3
.
And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. -- 1 peter 5:4
.
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. -- 1 peter 5:5
.
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: -- 1 peter 5:6
.
Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. -- 1 peter 5:7
.
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: -- 1 peter 5:8
.
Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. -- 1 peter 5:9
.
But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. -- 1 peter 5:10
.
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. -- 1 peter 5:11
.
By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. -- 1 peter 5:12
.
The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son. -- 1 peter 5:13
.
Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen. -- 1 peter 5:14
.
Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: -- 2 peter 1:1
.
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, -- 2 peter 1:2
.
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: -- 2 peter 1:3
.
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. -- 2 peter 1:4
.
And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; -- 2 peter 1:5
.
And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; -- 2 peter 1:6
.
And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. -- 2 peter 1:7
.
For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 peter 1:8
.
But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. -- 2 peter 1:9
.
Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: -- 2 peter 1:10
.
For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. -- 2 peter 1:11
.
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. -- 2 peter 1:12
.
Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; -- 2 peter 1:13
.
Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. -- 2 peter 1:14
.
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. -- 2 peter 1:15
.
For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. -- 2 peter 1:16
.
For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- 2 peter 1:17
.
And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. -- 2 peter 1:18
.
We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: -- 2 peter 1:19
.
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. -- 2 peter 1:20
.
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. -- 2 peter 1:21
.
But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. -- 2 peter 2:1
.
And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. -- 2 peter 2:2
.
And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. -- 2 peter 2:3
.
For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; -- 2 peter 2:4
.
And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; -- 2 peter 2:5
.
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; -- 2 peter 2:6
.
And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: -- 2 peter 2:7
.
(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) -- 2 peter 2:8
.
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: -- 2 peter 2:9
.
But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. -- 2 peter 2:10
.
Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. -- 2 peter 2:11
.
But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; -- 2 peter 2:12
.
And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; -- 2 peter 2:13
.
Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: -- 2 peter 2:14
.
Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; -- 2 peter 2:15
.
But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet. -- 2 peter 2:16
.
These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. -- 2 peter 2:17
.
For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. -- 2 peter 2:18
.
While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. -- 2 peter 2:19
.
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. -- 2 peter 2:20
.
For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. -- 2 peter 2:21
.
But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. -- 2 peter 2:22
.
This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: -- 2 peter 3:1
.
That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: -- 2 peter 3:2
.
Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, -- 2 peter 3:3
.
And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. -- 2 peter 3:4
.
For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: -- 2 peter 3:5
.
Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: -- 2 peter 3:6
.
But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. -- 2 peter 3:7
.
But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. -- 2 peter 3:8
.
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. -- 2 peter 3:9
.
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. -- 2 peter 3:10
.
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, -- 2 peter 3:11
.
Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? -- 2 peter 3:12
.
Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. -- 2 peter 3:13
.
Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. -- 2 peter 3:14
.
And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; -- 2 peter 3:15
.
As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. -- 2 peter 3:16
.
Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. -- 2 peter 3:17
.
But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. -- 2 peter 3:18
.
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; -- 1 john 1:1
.
(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) -- 1 john 1:2
.
That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. -- 1 john 1:3
.
And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. -- 1 john 1:4
.
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. -- 1 john 1:5
.
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: -- 1 john 1:6
.
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. -- 1 john 1:7
.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. -- 1 john 1:8
.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. -- 1 john 1:9
.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. -- 1 john 1:10
.
My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: -- 1 john 2:1
.
And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world. -- 1 john 2:2
.
And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. -- 1 john 2:3
.
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. -- 1 john 2:4
.
But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. -- 1 john 2:5
.
He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. -- 1 john 2:6
.
Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. -- 1 john 2:7
.
Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. -- 1 john 2:8
.
He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. -- 1 john 2:9
.
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. -- 1 john 2:10
.
But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. -- 1 john 2:11
.
I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. -- 1 john 2:12
.
I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. -- 1 john 2:13
.
I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. -- 1 john 2:14
.
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. -- 1 john 2:15
.
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. -- 1 john 2:16
.
And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. -- 1 john 2:17
.
Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. -- 1 john 2:18
.
They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. -- 1 john 2:19
.
But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. -- 1 john 2:20
.
I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. -- 1 john 2:21
.
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. -- 1 john 2:22
.
Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. -- 1 john 2:23
.
Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. -- 1 john 2:24
.
And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. -- 1 john 2:25
.
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. -- 1 john 2:26
.
But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. -- 1 john 2:27
.
And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. -- 1 john 2:28
.
If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him. -- 1 john 2:29
.
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. -- 1 john 3:1
.
Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- 1 john 3:2
.
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. -- 1 john 3:3
.
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. -- 1 john 3:4
.
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. -- 1 john 3:5
.
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. -- 1 john 3:6
.
Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. -- 1 john 3:7
.
He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. -- 1 john 3:8
.
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. -- 1 john 3:9
.
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. -- 1 john 3:10
.
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. -- 1 john 3:11
.
Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. -- 1 john 3:12
.
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. -- 1 john 3:13
.
We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. -- 1 john 3:14
.
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. -- 1 john 3:15
.
Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. -- 1 john 3:16
.
But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? -- 1 john 3:17
.
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. -- 1 john 3:18
.
And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. -- 1 john 3:19
.
For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. -- 1 john 3:20
.
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. -- 1 john 3:21
.
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. -- 1 john 3:22
.
And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. -- 1 john 3:23
.
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. -- 1 john 3:24
.
Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. -- 1 john 4:1
.
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: -- 1 john 4:2
.
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. -- 1 john 4:3
.
Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. -- 1 john 4:4
.
They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. -- 1 john 4:5
.
We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. -- 1 john 4:6
.
Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. -- 1 john 4:7
.
He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. -- 1 john 4:8
.
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. -- 1 john 4:9
.
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. -- 1 john 4:10
.
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. -- 1 john 4:11
.
No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. -- 1 john 4:12
.
Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. -- 1 john 4:13
.
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. -- 1 john 4:14
.
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. -- 1 john 4:15
.
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. -- 1 john 4:16
.
Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. -- 1 john 4:17
.
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. -- 1 john 4:18
.
We love him, because he first loved us. -- 1 john 4:19
.
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? -- 1 john 4:20
.
And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. -- 1 john 4:21
.
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. -- 1 john 5:1
.
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. -- 1 john 5:2
.
For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. -- 1 john 5:3
.
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. -- 1 john 5:4
.
Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? -- 1 john 5:5
.
This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. -- 1 john 5:6
.
For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. -- 1 john 5:7
.
And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. -- 1 john 5:8
.
If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. -- 1 john 5:9
.
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. -- 1 john 5:10
.
And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. -- 1 john 5:11
.
He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. -- 1 john 5:12
.
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. -- 1 john 5:13
.
And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: -- 1 john 5:14
.
And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. -- 1 john 5:15
.
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. -- 1 john 5:16
.
All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. -- 1 john 5:17
.
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. -- 1 john 5:18
.
And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. -- 1 john 5:19
.
And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. -- 1 john 5:20
.
Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. -- 1 john 5:21
.
The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; -- 2 john 1:1
.
For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. -- 2 john 1:2
.
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. -- 2 john 1:3
.
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. -- 2 john 1:4
.
And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. -- 2 john 1:5
.
And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. -- 2 john 1:6
.
For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. -- 2 john 1:7
.
Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. -- 2 john 1:8
.
Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. -- 2 john 1:9
.
If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: -- 2 john 1:10
.
For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. -- 2 john 1:11
.
Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. -- 2 john 1:12
.
The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen. -- 2 john 1:13
.
The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. -- 3 john 1:1
.
Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. -- 3 john 1:2
.
For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. -- 3 john 1:3
.
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. -- 3 john 1:4
.
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; -- 3 john 1:5
.
Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: -- 3 john 1:6
.
Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. -- 3 john 1:7
.
We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth. -- 3 john 1:8
.
I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. -- 3 john 1:9
.
Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. -- 3 john 1:10
.
Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. -- 3 john 1:11
.
Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true. -- 3 john 1:12
.
I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: -- 3 john 1:13
.
But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name. -- 3 john 1:14
.
Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called: -- jude 1:1
.
Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied. -- jude 1:2
.
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. -- jude 1:3
.
For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. -- jude 1:4
.
I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. -- jude 1:5
.
And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. -- jude 1:6
.
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. -- jude 1:7
.
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. -- jude 1:8
.
Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. -- jude 1:9
.
But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. -- jude 1:10
.
Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. -- jude 1:11
.
These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; -- jude 1:12
.
Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. -- jude 1:13
.
And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, -- jude 1:14
.
To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. -- jude 1:15
.
These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage. -- jude 1:16
.
But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; -- jude 1:17
.
How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. -- jude 1:18
.
These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. -- jude 1:19
.
But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, -- jude 1:20
.
Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. -- jude 1:21
.
And of some have compassion, making a difference: -- jude 1:22
.
And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. -- jude 1:23
.
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, -- jude 1:24
.
To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen. -- jude 1:25
.
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: -- revelation 1:1
.
Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. -- revelation 1:2
.
Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. -- revelation 1:3
.
John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; -- revelation 1:4
.
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, -- revelation 1:5
.
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. -- revelation 1:6
.
Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. -- revelation 1:7
.
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. -- revelation 1:8
.
I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. -- revelation 1:9
.
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, -- revelation 1:10
.
Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. -- revelation 1:11
.
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; -- revelation 1:12
.
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. -- revelation 1:13
.
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; -- revelation 1:14
.
And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. -- revelation 1:15
.
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. -- revelation 1:16
.
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: -- revelation 1:17
.
I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. -- revelation 1:18
.
Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; -- revelation 1:19
.
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. -- revelation 1:20
.
Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; -- revelation 2:1
.
I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: -- revelation 2:2
.
And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. -- revelation 2:3
.
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. -- revelation 2:4
.
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. -- revelation 2:5
.
But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate. -- revelation 2:6
.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. -- revelation 2:7
.
And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; -- revelation 2:8
.
I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. -- revelation 2:9
.
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. -- revelation 2:10
.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. -- revelation 2:11
.
And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; -- revelation 2:12
.
I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. -- revelation 2:13
.
But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. -- revelation 2:14
.
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate. -- revelation 2:15
.
Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. -- revelation 2:16
.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. -- revelation 2:17
.
And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass; -- revelation 2:18
.
I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first. -- revelation 2:19
.
Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. -- revelation 2:20
.
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. -- revelation 2:21
.
Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. -- revelation 2:22
.
And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. -- revelation 2:23
.
But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. -- revelation 2:24
.
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come. -- revelation 2:25
.
And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: -- revelation 2:26
.
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. -- revelation 2:27
.
And I will give him the morning star. -- revelation 2:28
.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. -- revelation 2:29
.
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. -- revelation 3:1
.
Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. -- revelation 3:2
.
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. -- revelation 3:3
.
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. -- revelation 3:4
.
He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. -- revelation 3:5
.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. -- revelation 3:6
.
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; -- revelation 3:7
.
I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. -- revelation 3:8
.
Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. -- revelation 3:9
.
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. -- revelation 3:10
.
Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. -- revelation 3:11
.
Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. -- revelation 3:12
.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. -- revelation 3:13
.
And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; -- revelation 3:14
.
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. -- revelation 3:15
.
So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. -- revelation 3:16
.
Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: -- revelation 3:17
.
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. -- revelation 3:18
.
As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. -- revelation 3:19
.
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. -- revelation 3:20
.
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. -- revelation 3:21
.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. -- revelation 3:22
.
After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. -- revelation 4:1
.
And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. -- revelation 4:2
.
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. -- revelation 4:3
.
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. -- revelation 4:4
.
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. -- revelation 4:5
.
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. -- revelation 4:6
.
And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. -- revelation 4:7
.
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. -- revelation 4:8
.
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, -- revelation 4:9
.
The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, -- revelation 4:10
.
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. -- revelation 4:11
.
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. -- revelation 5:1
.
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? -- revelation 5:2
.
And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. -- revelation 5:3
.
And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. -- revelation 5:4
.
And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. -- revelation 5:5
.
And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. -- revelation 5:6
.
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. -- revelation 5:7
.
And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. -- revelation 5:8
.
And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; -- revelation 5:9
.
And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. -- revelation 5:10
.
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; -- revelation 5:11
.
Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. -- revelation 5:12
.
And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. -- revelation 5:13
.
And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever. -- revelation 5:14
.
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. -- revelation 6:1
.
And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. -- revelation 6:2
.
And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. -- revelation 6:3
.
And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. -- revelation 6:4
.
And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. -- revelation 6:5
.
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. -- revelation 6:6
.
And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. -- revelation 6:7
.
And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. -- revelation 6:8
.
And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: -- revelation 6:9
.
And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? -- revelation 6:10
.
And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. -- revelation 6:11
.
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; -- revelation 6:12
.
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. -- revelation 6:13
.
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. -- revelation 6:14
.
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; -- revelation 6:15
.
And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: -- revelation 6:16
.
For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? -- revelation 6:17
.
And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. -- revelation 7:1
.
And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, -- revelation 7:2
.
Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. -- revelation 7:3
.
And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. -- revelation 7:4
.
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. -- revelation 7:5
.
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand. -- revelation 7:6
.
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. -- revelation 7:7
.
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. -- revelation 7:8
.
After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; -- revelation 7:9
.
And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. -- revelation 7:10
.
And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, -- revelation 7:11
.
Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. -- revelation 7:12
.
And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? -- revelation 7:13
.
And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. -- revelation 7:14
.
Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. -- revelation 7:15
.
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. -- revelation 7:16
.
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. -- revelation 7:17
.
And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. -- revelation 8:1
.
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. -- revelation 8:2
.
And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. -- revelation 8:3
.
And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. -- revelation 8:4
.
And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. -- revelation 8:5
.
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. -- revelation 8:6
.
The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. -- revelation 8:7
.
And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; -- revelation 8:8
.
And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. -- revelation 8:9
.
And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; -- revelation 8:10
.
And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. -- revelation 8:11
.
And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. -- revelation 8:12
.
And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound! -- revelation 8:13
.
And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. -- revelation 9:1
.
And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. -- revelation 9:2
.
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. -- revelation 9:3
.
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. -- revelation 9:4
.
And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. -- revelation 9:5
.
And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. -- revelation 9:6
.
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. -- revelation 9:7
.
And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. -- revelation 9:8
.
And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. -- revelation 9:9
.
And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. -- revelation 9:10
.
And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. -- revelation 9:11
.
One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter. -- revelation 9:12
.
And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, -- revelation 9:13
.
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. -- revelation 9:14
.
And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. -- revelation 9:15
.
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. -- revelation 9:16
.
And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. -- revelation 9:17
.
By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. -- revelation 9:18
.
For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. -- revelation 9:19
.
And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: -- revelation 9:20
.
Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. -- revelation 9:21
.
And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: -- revelation 10:1
.
And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, -- revelation 10:2
.
And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. -- revelation 10:3
.
And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. -- revelation 10:4
.
And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, -- revelation 10:5
.
And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: -- revelation 10:6
.
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. -- revelation 10:7
.
And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. -- revelation 10:8
.
And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. -- revelation 10:9
.
And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. -- revelation 10:10
.
And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. -- revelation 10:11
.
And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. -- revelation 11:1
.
But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. -- revelation 11:2
.
And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. -- revelation 11:3
.
These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. -- revelation 11:4
.
And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. -- revelation 11:5
.
These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. -- revelation 11:6
.
And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. -- revelation 11:7
.
And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. -- revelation 11:8
.
And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. -- revelation 11:9
.
And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. -- revelation 11:10
.
And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. -- revelation 11:11
.
And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. -- revelation 11:12
.
And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. -- revelation 11:13
.
The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. -- revelation 11:14
.
And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. -- revelation 11:15
.
And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, -- revelation 11:16
.
Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. -- revelation 11:17
.
And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. -- revelation 11:18
.
And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. -- revelation 11:19
.
And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: -- revelation 12:1
.
And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. -- revelation 12:2
.
And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. -- revelation 12:3
.
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. -- revelation 12:4
.
And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. -- revelation 12:5
.
And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. -- revelation 12:6
.
And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, -- revelation 12:7
.
And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. -- revelation 12:8
.
And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. -- revelation 12:9
.
And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. -- revelation 12:10
.
And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. -- revelation 12:11
.
Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. -- revelation 12:12
.
And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. -- revelation 12:13
.
And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. -- revelation 12:14
.
And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. -- revelation 12:15
.
And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. -- revelation 12:16
.
And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. -- revelation 12:17
.
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. -- revelation 13:1
.
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. -- revelation 13:2
.
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. -- revelation 13:3
.
And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? -- revelation 13:4
.
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. -- revelation 13:5
.
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. -- revelation 13:6
.
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. -- revelation 13:7
.
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. -- revelation 13:8
.
If any man have an ear, let him hear. -- revelation 13:9
.
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. -- revelation 13:10
.
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. -- revelation 13:11
.
And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. -- revelation 13:12
.
And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, -- revelation 13:13
.
And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. -- revelation 13:14
.
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. -- revelation 13:15
.
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: -- revelation 13:16
.
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. -- revelation 13:17
.
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. -- revelation 13:18
.
And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. -- revelation 14:1
.
And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: -- revelation 14:2
.
And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. -- revelation 14:3
.
These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. -- revelation 14:4
.
And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God. -- revelation 14:5
.
And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, -- revelation 14:6
.
Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. -- revelation 14:7
.
And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. -- revelation 14:8
.
And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, -- revelation 14:9
.
The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: -- revelation 14:10
.
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. -- revelation 14:11
.
Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. -- revelation 14:12
.
And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. -- revelation 14:13
.
And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. -- revelation 14:14
.
And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. -- revelation 14:15
.
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. -- revelation 14:16
.
And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. -- revelation 14:17
.
And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. -- revelation 14:18
.
And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. -- revelation 14:19
.
And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs. -- revelation 14:20
.
And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God. -- revelation 15:1
.
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. -- revelation 15:2
.
And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. -- revelation 15:3
.
Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest. -- revelation 15:4
.
And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: -- revelation 15:5
.
And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. -- revelation 15:6
.
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. -- revelation 15:7
.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. -- revelation 15:8
.
And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. -- revelation 16:1
.
And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. -- revelation 16:2
.
And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea. -- revelation 16:3
.
And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. -- revelation 16:4
.
And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. -- revelation 16:5
.
For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. -- revelation 16:6
.
And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments. -- revelation 16:7
.
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. -- revelation 16:8
.
And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. -- revelation 16:9
.
And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, -- revelation 16:10
.
And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds. -- revelation 16:11
.
And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. -- revelation 16:12
.
And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. -- revelation 16:13
.
For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. -- revelation 16:14
.
Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. -- revelation 16:15
.
And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. -- revelation 16:16
.
And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. -- revelation 16:17
.
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. -- revelation 16:18
.
And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. -- revelation 16:19
.
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. -- revelation 16:20
.
And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. -- revelation 16:21
.
And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: -- revelation 17:1
.
With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. -- revelation 17:2
.
So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. -- revelation 17:3
.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: -- revelation 17:4
.
And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. -- revelation 17:5
.
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. -- revelation 17:6
.
And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. -- revelation 17:7
.
The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. -- revelation 17:8
.
And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. -- revelation 17:9
.
And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. -- revelation 17:10
.
And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. -- revelation 17:11
.
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. -- revelation 17:12
.
These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. -- revelation 17:13
.
These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. -- revelation 17:14
.
And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. -- revelation 17:15
.
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. -- revelation 17:16
.
For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. -- revelation 17:17
.
And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. -- revelation 17:18
.
And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. -- revelation 18:1
.
And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. -- revelation 18:2
.
For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. -- revelation 18:3
.
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. -- revelation 18:4
.
For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. -- revelation 18:5
.
Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double. -- revelation 18:6
.
How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. -- revelation 18:7
.
Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. -- revelation 18:8
.
And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, -- revelation 18:9
.
Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come. -- revelation 18:10
.
And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more: -- revelation 18:11
.
The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble, -- revelation 18:12
.
And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men. -- revelation 18:13
.
And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all. -- revelation 18:14
.
The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, -- revelation 18:15
.
And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! -- revelation 18:16
.
For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, -- revelation 18:17
.
And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! -- revelation 18:18
.
And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate. -- revelation 18:19
.
Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. -- revelation 18:20
.
And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. -- revelation 18:21
.
And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; -- revelation 18:22
.
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. -- revelation 18:23
.
And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth. -- revelation 18:24
.
And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: -- revelation 19:1
.
For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. -- revelation 19:2
.
And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. -- revelation 19:3
.
And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. -- revelation 19:4
.
And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. -- revelation 19:5
.
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. -- revelation 19:6
.
Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. -- revelation 19:7
.
And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. -- revelation 19:8
.
And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. -- revelation 19:9
.
And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. -- revelation 19:10
.
And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. -- revelation 19:11
.
His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. -- revelation 19:12
.
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. -- revelation 19:13
.
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. -- revelation 19:14
.
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. -- revelation 19:15
.
And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. -- revelation 19:16
.
And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; -- revelation 19:17
.
That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. -- revelation 19:18
.
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. -- revelation 19:19
.
And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. -- revelation 19:20
.
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. -- revelation 19:21
.
And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. -- revelation 20:1
.
And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, -- revelation 20:2
.
And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. -- revelation 20:3
.
And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. -- revelation 20:4
.
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. -- revelation 20:5
.
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. -- revelation 20:6
.
And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, -- revelation 20:7
.
And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. -- revelation 20:8
.
And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. -- revelation 20:9
.
And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. -- revelation 20:10
.
And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. -- revelation 20:11
.
And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. -- revelation 20:12
.
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. -- revelation 20:13
.
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. -- revelation 20:14
.
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. -- revelation 20:15
.
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. -- revelation 21:1
.
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. -- revelation 21:2
.
And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. -- revelation 21:3
.
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. -- revelation 21:4
.
And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. -- revelation 21:5
.
And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. -- revelation 21:6
.
He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. -- revelation 21:7
.
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. -- revelation 21:8
.
And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. -- revelation 21:9
.
And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, -- revelation 21:10
.
Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; -- revelation 21:11
.
And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: -- revelation 21:12
.
On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. -- revelation 21:13
.
And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. -- revelation 21:14
.
And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. -- revelation 21:15
.
And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. -- revelation 21:16
.
And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. -- revelation 21:17
.
And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. -- revelation 21:18
.
And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; -- revelation 21:19
.
The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. -- revelation 21:20
.
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. -- revelation 21:21
.
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. -- revelation 21:22
.
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. -- revelation 21:23
.
And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. -- revelation 21:24
.
And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there. -- revelation 21:25
.
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. -- revelation 21:26
.
And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life. -- revelation 21:27
.
And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. -- revelation 22:1
.
In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. -- revelation 22:2
.
And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: -- revelation 22:3
.
And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. -- revelation 22:4
.
And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever. -- revelation 22:5
.
And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done. -- revelation 22:6
.
Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book. -- revelation 22:7
.
And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. -- revelation 22:8
.
Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God. -- revelation 22:9
.
And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. -- revelation 22:10
.
He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. -- revelation 22:11
.
And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. -- revelation 22:12
.
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. -- revelation 22:13
.
Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. -- revelation 22:14
.
For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie. -- revelation 22:15
.
I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. -- revelation 22:16
.
And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. -- revelation 22:17
.
For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: -- revelation 22:18
.
And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. -- revelation 22:19
.
He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. -- revelation 22:20
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. -- revelation 22:21
.
